1
00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:00,231
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:03,932
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:05,133
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:07,870
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:11,744
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:13,509
These are their stories,

7
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:16,617
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

8
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,085
You Iooking for somebody?

9
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:23,319
Officer downstairs said
somebody in Special Victims
could help me.

10
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:28,126
Who's catching?
Yo. That'd be me.
I'II call you back.

11
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:30,131
Hi. I'm Detective Stabler.

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,292
Rebecca Tolliver.

13
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,928
Is there someplace
where we can speak privately?

14
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:38,735
Of course.
How can I help you today?

15
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:41,643
I need to report a rape.

16
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:44,376
Right through here.

17
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:47,411
I didn't know
how to handle this.

18
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:51,647
You did the right thing
coming here. Have you been
to see a doctor yet?

19
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:56,453
I wasn't attacked.
It's my daughter, Katie.

20
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:02,492
What happened to Katie?
I'm not exactly sure.

21
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:04,123
How do you know
she was raped?

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,727
She started throwing up.
I took her to the doctor.
She's pregnant.

23
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:12,833
Does Katie have a boyfriend?
No, never. No.

24
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:15,300
How old is she?

25
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:18,178
Twenty-two.

26
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:26,052
Ms. Tolliver, your daughter
is an adult. If she were
raped, she needs to report it.

27
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:29,354
Talk to her. She's waiting
in the hallway.

28
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:44,105
Hi, Katie.
I'm Detective Stabler.

29
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:49,773
How do you introduce yourself?

30
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,582
I'm Katie.

31
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,748
It's nice to meet you, Katie.

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,134
BENSON: So, Katie, your mom
says that she took you
to the doctor.

33
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,939
I don't feel good.

34
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,536
What happens
when you don't feel good?

35
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,171
I throw up.

36
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:02,309
How come you're throwing up?

37
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:05,183
'Cause the doctor says
I got a baby in me.

38
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:08,246
But there's no daddy.

39
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:10,788
Babies need a mommy
and a daddy.

40
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,790
Could I have a glass of water?
Sure.

41
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,192
Is Katie's father
still in the picture?

42
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:22,668
He Ieft us
after Katie was born.

43
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:30,471
Can you think of anyone
who's shown any undue
interest in Katie recently?

44
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:32,673
No, but she's away
from me all day Iong.

45
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:35,774
I have to work,
so Katie goes
to a day program,

46
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:38,479
and she has a part-time job
three afternoons a week.

47
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:41,580
It would be easy for someone
to take advantage of her.

48
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:44,353
Ms. Tolliver, have you
discussed sex with Katie?

49
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:48,386
She has the mind of a child.
She'd never understand.

50
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,765
Could I hear
what they're saying?
Of course.

51
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:54,331
Katie, do you know
where babies come from?

52
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,037
It's... It's private.

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,473
It's okay. You can tell me.
We're both girls.

54
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:03,603
My mom will be mad.

55
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:07,410
No, she won't.
I talked to her.
She said that it was okay.

56
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:15,716
Babies come from sex.
Mmm-hmm.

57
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:19,357
Do you know
what sex is, Katie?

58
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:25,195
A mommy and daddy kiss
and hold hands.
Mmm-hmm.

59
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:31,301
Do you kiss and hold hands
with anybody?

60
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:35,871
It's okay. You can tell me.
It'II be our secret.

61
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:40,177
I'm gonna throw up.

62
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,284
Okay. Come on.
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

63
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:47,117
I have to help her.

64
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:49,486
Ms. Tolliver,
Detective Stabler's gonna need

65
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:51,890
whatever information
you can give him
for his report.

66
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:57,490
After I check on Katie. I want
you to find the son of a bitch
that did this to us!

67
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,393
Did this to us?

68
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:06,566
Woman spent her Iife taking
care of a special needs child
who's now an adult.

69
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:08,269
Her nest will never be empty.

70
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,368
Look, I'm very sympathetic,

71
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:12,903
but we might have more to
work with had she taught
Katie about the facts of Iife.

72
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:16,008
And until Katie knows them,
she's not gonna be able
to tell us who raped her.

73
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,883
We educate her, she testifies,
jury thinks we coached her.

74
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:21,013
Maybe we should
call the shrink
to evaluate her.

75
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,148
I'II call Huang.

76
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:26,354
In the meantime, Iet's check
with Katie's doctor. See if
he gave her a pelvic exam.

77
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:29,159
Then I wanna nail down
her daily routine.

78
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,860
Ms. Tolliver, this is our
department psychiatrist,
Dr. George Huang.

79
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:36,962
How many people
do we have to talk to?

80
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,904
Ma'am, I'd just Iike
a few minutes
with your daughter

81
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:41,374
to explore her comprehension
of what happened to her.

82
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:42,934
Can't this wait till tomorrow?

83
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,503
Ma'am, the more the time
passes, the Iess chance
we have of catching...

84
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:48,948
I just can't put her through
any more now, Detective.

85
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:52,083
Come on, Katie,
we're going home.

86
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:58,256
She thinks
you just file a complaint,
we do the rest.

87
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:00,390
Just means we got to find
another way in.

88
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:01,487
What do we got so far?

89
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:03,998
Well, Katie's doctor
confirms the pregnancy.

90
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,226
Said she had sex repeatedly,

91
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,893
but there's no way to tell
whether it was forcible.

92
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,301
She goes to a day center
in Murray Hill
five days a week,

93
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:12,273
and she works at
a nearby grocery Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Fridays.

94
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:13,808
Fin and Munch will check out
the grocery store.

95
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:15,173
You two hit the day center.
Okay.

96
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,678
Katie would have been
tested for placement
in the appropriate classes.

97
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:20,875
If you can get the results,
I'II have a better idea
of her abilities.

98
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,886
LUCAS: Katie's IQ
is around 55.

99
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:31,782
It's borderline between
mild and moderate
mental retardation.

100
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:35,189
Her mother
kept her home today.
How's she doing?

101
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:38,165
She's confused.
She doesn't understand
what's happening to her.

102
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:40,896
Yeah, she'd understand more
if her mother Iet her
out of the cocoon.

103
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,200
Parent's first instinct
is to protect their children.

104
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:46,503
Rebecca Tolliver
is overprotective.

105
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,975
Doesn't think
Katie can function
in the world without her.

106
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:51,478
And you disagree.
Yes, I do.

107
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,606
And what does Katie do
when she's here?

108
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:56,150
Art and music therapy,
Iife skills training.

109
00:06:56,218 --> 00:07:00,245
We also teach
independent Iiving,
dating and sex education,

110
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:02,620
but Katie's mother
won't Iet her
take any of those.

111
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:04,852
How carefully do you screen
your employees?

112
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:08,488
Background checks, references.
We've never had a problem.

113
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,763
Katie have any friends
we can talk to?

114
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,667
Her best friend
is Danny Jordan. He's
one of our success stories.

115
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:17,331
STABLER: Any chance
they're more than friends?

116
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:21,038
We supervise our clients
very closely.

117
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,601
Nobody here has ever reported
Danny touching Katie.

118
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:26,580
And he's taken
our dating class and sex ed.

119
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:28,875
I know what sex is.

120
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,816
STABLER:
Did you ever tell Katie?

121
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,244
No.

122
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:33,950
How come?

123
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:36,982
She has to Iearn about it
in school first. That's...

124
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:39,152
That's what our teacher said.

125
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:41,059
You and Katie ever have sex?

126
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:43,589
No.

127
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,535
She ever tell you
if someone was bothering her?

128
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:51,863
I promised I wouldn't say.

129
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:53,909
Danny, you know
I'm a police officer?

130
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,370
And I'm here because
we think someone's
been bothering Katie.

131
00:07:57,446 --> 00:08:01,007
Now, if you know who it is,
you got to tell me
so that I can help her.

132
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,282
It's okay, Danny.

133
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,553
Ray, the bus driver.

134
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,661
Your bus driver?

135
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:22,135
I take the real bus.
Katie, she takes
the Iittle bus.

136
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:24,672
Van brings Katie here,
to work and then home.

137
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:27,139
And what did Katie say
about this bus driver?

138
00:08:28,143 --> 00:08:29,770
He's mean to her.

139
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,743
What'd he do to her?

140
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,451
He took things from her.

141
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,614
What else did he do to Katie?

142
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,649
He touched her.

143
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:49,420
Katie comes in one day,
she's crying. Says her
bus driver pushed her.

144
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:53,332
I went outside and told
the bastard I'd get him fired
if I heard it happened again.

145
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,768
Anyone in the store
give Katie a hard time?

146
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:59,706
Last month. I fired
the frozen foods manager
for calling her an imbecile.

147
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:00,901
That happen a Iot?

148
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:03,945
Except for the occasional
ignorant customer,
almost never.

149
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:06,914
I'm on the board at the day
center. I don't tolerate
that kind of abuse.

150
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:10,884
What does she do around here?
Stocks shelves,
bags groceries, sweeps up.

151
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,853
Day center sends me

Besides the bus driver,
Katie ever mention
anybody outside the store

157
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,263
that gave her trouble?

158
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:30,794
No. I figured the only reason
she told me about it was
because it had just happened.

159
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,704
She was really upset.

We can't arrest the bus driver
until Katie tells us
what he did.

What have we got on this guy?

Ray Dunstan, he's 52.
He's got no rap sheet.

164
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:46,186
But the nursing home where
he worked out in GIen Cove
fired him Iast year

165
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:48,280
for allegedly stealing
from the residents.

166

Why wasn't he arrested?

167
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:52,354
Dunstan claims
that the old folks
gave him gifts.

He picks the ones

Of course not.

admitted that he was
the father.

00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:12,326
I asked for a DNA study
to confirm it.
The baby was his.

Nobody went to the police.

302
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,235
I thought we could
handle it internally.

303
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:18,464
We started the dating classes
so this wouldn't happen again.

304
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,974
Well, history has a way
of repeating itself,
doesn't it?

305
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:23,307
It's because Katie
and others Iike her
have the minds of children,

306
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:27,007
but they Iive in adult bodies,
complete with hormones.

307
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,572
This could easily happen again

308
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,778
unless Katie's mother
stops sheltering her
from reality.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

311
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,456
He's not wrong
about Katie's mother.

312
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:43,225
If I were in her shoes,
I don't know
I'd react any differently.

313
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:47,667
You'd want to find your
child's rapist. She's got
to Iet Huang talk to Katie.

314
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,966
I'm gonna take
another shot at her.

315
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,334
Absolutely not.

316
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:54,500
You said you wanted
to find out who did this.

317
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:57,841
Without having to put Katie
through this again.
She's too fragile.

318
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:01,440
Ms. Tolliver, with all
due respect, who are you
trying to protect here?

319
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:06,015
If you're saying
that this is about my guilt...

320
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:09,387
I am not saying
it's your fault
that Katie was raped.

321
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:15,619
Everything bad
that's happened to Katie
and to me, it's my fault.

322
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:21,231
Because 22 years ago
I chose to have a child
with Down syndrome

323
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:26,104
rather than to have
an abortion, and it
destroyed my marriage.

324
00:18:29,578 --> 00:18:34,174
She's my whole Iife,
and I have to protect her.

325
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:36,080
Then make sure
this doesn't happen
to her again.

326
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:38,711
Let us talk to her
at the day center.

327
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:43,784
We'II make it so she's
comfortable, she's familiar
with the surroundings.

328
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,519
Our Assistant
District Attorney will
be there to talk to her,

329
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:49,621
so Katie doesn't have to
keep repeating herself
over and over.

330
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,994
PIease.

331
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,502
Katie, what do you call this?
Ear.

332
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:08,179
And what do you call this?
Arm.

333
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:10,141
How about this?

00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,211
Boob.

335
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:17,385
Very good, Katie.
You know all your body parts.

336
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:20,258
Thank you.

337
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:24,162
Now I want to talk
about your friends.
Who's your best friend?

338
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,460
Danny.

339
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,567
And what do you and Danny
do together?

340
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,231
Talk. We eat Iunch.

341
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:35,271
What else do you do?

342
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:39,046
It's private.

343
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,776
HUANG: Do you and Danny
touch each other?

344
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:44,911
Yeah.

345
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:49,652
AIex, could you stand up,
please? Thanks.

346
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,620
Katie, could you just point
to where you and Danny touch?

347
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:57,328
Like this.

348
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,091
Anywhere else?

349
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:07,202
We kiss.

350
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:12,772
Does Danny touch you
in your private parts?

351
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,939
No.

352
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:23,652
I got my baby from Danny.

353
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:26,752
How?

354
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:33,223
Kissing, stupid. Your friend
doesn't know anything.

355
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,533
Danny's the father?

356
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:41,371
Katie says he's her boyfriend.
It's possible.

357
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,775
But she still
has no comprehension
of how she got pregnant.

358
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:45,142
How could you Iet this happen?

359
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:48,239
We both know how closely
Katie is supervised.
It didn't happen here.

360
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:50,250
But they're not together
anyplace else.

361
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:52,582
Aren't you going
to have him arrested?

362
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:55,680
Katie's uncorroborated
statement isn't enough
because of her disability.

363
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:58,624
And we can't do
a paternity test
until the baby's born.

364
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:01,025
We're terminating
the pregnancy.

365
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:03,726
When?
Tomorrow.
We have an appointment.

366
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:06,289
Does Katie know?
I was going
to tell her tonight.

367
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:09,201
Tell her? Where's her say
in this decision?

368
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:12,672
Her baby has a 50-50 chance
of having Down syndrome.

369
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,538
Who's going to take care
of them when I'm gone?

370
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:17,271
Katie is, with all the support
we can provide her.

371
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:22,009
No. I am not having Katie
going through what I have.

372
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:25,482
She can't keep this baby.
Why?

373
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:28,455
Why what, sweetie?

374
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,420
Why can't I have my baby?

375
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:33,988
Katie,

376
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:38,125
I can't take care
of both of you.

377
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,099
Why can't I be a mommy?

378
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,000
We're not gonna
have this conversation now.

379
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:48,805
Here. Here's the address.

380
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:52,074
You meet us there,
and you'II get
your DNA sample.

381
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,983
I want my baby.

382
00:21:57,652 --> 00:22:01,213
Mommy, please
don't take away my baby.

383
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:08,227
We'II be ready for Katie
in a few minutes.

384
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:10,594
Is it gonna hurt?
No, Katie, it won't hurt.

385
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,633
You'II be asleep, honey.

386
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:15,135
Mom says I snore.

387
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:16,768
Thank you.

00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,903
Detective Benson.

389
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:23,466
This is a subpoena for
the tissue sample from
the products of conception.

390
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:26,343
We'II bring it to you
after the procedure.
Thank you.

(DOOR OPENS)

392
00:22:34,756 --> 00:22:35,848
KATIE: Hi, Scott.

393
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:38,188
What the hell
are you doing here?

394
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,220
Mr. Lucas has obtained
an injunction
to stop the abortion

395
00:22:42,297 --> 00:22:43,924
pending the outcome
of a hearing.

396
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:45,795
What kind of hearing?

397
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,526
Guardianship of your daughter.

398
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:50,833
Katie has the right to decide
whether or not
to keep her baby.

399
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:53,703
She is not capable
of making that decision.

400
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:04,947
If the court finds Katie
competent to care
for her child,

401
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,852
her rapist's defense Iawyer
is going to argue
that she was competent enough

402
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,685
to consent to sex.

403
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,419
She doesn't even know
where that baby came from.

404
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,256
It doesn't matter.
Once she's found competent,

405
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:16,229
all the defense
is going to focus on
is that she never said "no"'

406
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:18,629
So the case is Iost
before we've
collared the rapist?

407
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,794
If it's a rape. Are we sure
it's not the boyfriend?

408
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,861
Munch and Fin talked to him,
but no matter what he says,

409
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:26,930
we can't check
the story without DNA.

410
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:29,838
How many weeks
is Katie into her pregnancy?

411
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:31,173
Ten.

412
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:33,077
Too early for amniocentesis.

413
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:35,810
But not for a CVS test.
In English, please.

414
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:37,408
Chorionic villus sampling.

415
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:39,976
We take some tissue
from the placenta Iining
to get the baby's DNA.

416
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:41,919
We did one for another case
about a year ago.

417
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,821
How are we gonna get
Katie's mother to go for it?

418
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:47,692
Tell her she can find out
whether her grandchild
has Down syndrome.

419
00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:50,589
You wanna ask Rebecca,
or should I?

420
00:23:50,665 --> 00:23:53,566
Whoever she's Iess pissed at.
What's wrong?

421
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,629
Your captain said
that you were on the way over.

422
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:57,762
Is Katie okay?

423
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,899
She's supposed
to be at school,
and she never got there.

424
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:03,704
Where's Danny?
Day center said
he's a no-show.

425
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,143
Called in sick this morning.

426
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:06,271
How much we know about him?

427
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,645
He shares
an independent Iiving
apartment in the East Village.

428
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:10,149
Parents Iive up in Riverdale.

429
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:11,617
OIivia's on the phone
with them right now.

430
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:13,881
What did we get
from Katie's mother?

431
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:16,219
Anger, blame, but nothing
that's gonna help us.

432
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,191
You know, Danny's been
on his own for a while.

433
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,590
He may be thinking
for the both of them.

434
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,026
If Danny thinks
he's the baby's father,

435
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,188
makes sense they'd run
to prevent an abortion.

436
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:25,357
Even if he's not the father,
makes sense he'd help her.

437
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:29,301
Two innocents alone in
the big city. They're gonna
need shelter, money for food.

438
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,803
Danny's parents
haven't heard from him.

439
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:35,104
But they had an apartment
at 73rd and Amsterdam,
where Danny grew up.

440
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:37,974
They're on the run,
first place they're gonna
go is somewhere familiar.

441
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:41,311
Well, the parents said that
Danny Iives with a roommate
named Andy McCollum.

442
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:43,509
We'II just pay Andy a visit.

443
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:47,347
Danny didn't tell me
where he went. We don't
answer to each other.

444
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:48,855
Did he stay here Iast night?

445
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:50,015
Yeah.

446
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:52,992
When's the Iast time
you saw him?
Earlier.

447
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:54,790
Help us out here. We think
he ran away with a girl.

448
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:55,852
It's a free country.

449
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,125
She's got Down syndrome.
We need to know where she is.

450
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:01,930
So her mother
can abort her baby?
Danny told me all about it.

451
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:03,493
Come on,
Andy with the attitude.

452
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:06,267
We're just trying to make sure
both of them are safe.

453
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:10,072
They were here this morning.
Danny took some clothes
and they Ieft.

454
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,873
He say where
they were going?

455
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:13,538
No, just asked to
borrow some money.

456
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:14,639
MUNCH: Did you give him any?

457
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:17,879
I didn't have any cash,
so I gave him my ATM card.

458
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:20,011
You make that a habit?
He could clean you out.

459
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:23,580
He won't.
If you can't trust Danny,
you can't trust anyone.

460
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,121
So Danny came back
to the old neighborhood.

461
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:29,458
Home is where the heart is.

462
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:32,625
He used his roommate's
ATM card right here this
morning, took out 200 bucks.

463
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,725
You can barely eat dinner
around here for $200.

464
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:36,531
Well, a couple Iike that's
got to stand out.

465
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:39,198
If they spent the money
around here, somebody's
gonna remember them.

466
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:40,263
Where do we start?

467
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:41,535
Danny Iived
two blocks from here.

468
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,304
You guys take Broadway.
We'II take Amsterdam.

469
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,709
AII right.

470
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:49,679
MAN: Yeah. They were here.

471
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:52,914
Sweet. Came up to the counter
holding hands.

472
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:54,545
When?
This morning.

473
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:57,489
What'd they want?
The girl said
she'd been throwing up.

474
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,821
You give her anything?

475
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,691
Nothing over the counter
because she said
she's pregnant.

476
00:26:01,763 --> 00:26:05,426
I told them to hit a
grocery store. Ginger ale's
as good as anything.

477
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,960
Yeah. Yeah, they came in
just before the Iunch rush.
They must have a newborn.

478
00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:11,602
What makes you say that?

479
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:15,666
They just about cleaned me out
of disposable diapers,
infant size.

480
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:19,543
AIso, they bought some
ginger ale. Her husband
said she was puking.

481
00:26:19,614 --> 00:26:22,481
When they Ieft,
did you happen to notice
which direction they headed?

482
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,418
I can do better than that.
Girl said she needed a job,

483
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:29,650
said she had experience
working in a supermarket.

484
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:34,958
I could tell she was slow,
but stocking shelves
ain't rocket science.

485
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,422
Yeah. The husband filled out
the application.

486
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:45,535
Smells awful good in here,
Katie.

487
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:46,699
What are you cooking?

488
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:47,866
Soup.

489
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:50,672
Soup. Your mom teach you
how to cook?

490
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:55,042
Mom says I can't,
but Danny taught me.

491
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:58,843
KATIE: You want some
chocolate milk?
Yeah. Sure. Thanks.

(DOOR CLOSES)

493
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:03,190
Danny's home.

494
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,686
What do you want?

495
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:10,655
We need to talk
to you and Katie.
You can't take our baby.

496
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:11,960
That's not why we're here.

497
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:14,365
Katie, your mom wants
you to come home.

498
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:17,199
DANNY: This is our new home.
This is my bed.

499
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,499
And this is Danny's.

500
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:26,410
We're getting married.

501
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:30,842
First, we're all gonna go
for a ride down to our office.

502
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:33,946
Okay.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

504
00:27:39,027 --> 00:27:41,325
Oh, I was so worried
about you.

505
00:27:41,396 --> 00:27:42,920
I'm okay, Mama.

506
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:45,797
She's okay.

507
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,297
What did you do to her?

508
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:50,428
I didn't hurt Katie.
I Iove her and she Ioves me.

509
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:51,798
He kidnapped and raped her.

510
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:52,965
Katie went willingly.

511
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:57,944
I didn't have sex with Katie.
Today, I told Katie what the
teacher said about sex,

512
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:00,037
and she didn't believe me.

513
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,949
What did Katie say
when you told her
what sex was?

514
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:08,284
She said, "That's not sex.
That's exercise"'

515
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:15,552
So, Katie, tell me
how you exercise.

516
00:28:16,464 --> 00:28:20,127
You pull your pants down,
and you sit on someone's Iap.

517
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:22,633
And who taught you that?

518
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:25,033
It's a secret.

519
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:29,206
It's all right, honey.
You can tell me and OIivia.

520
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:36,216
Then he won't give me anymore
ice cream or candy.

521
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:38,749
Who won't?

522
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:45,322
Sweetheart,
this is really important.
PIease tell Mama.

523
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:51,762
Mr. Cheney.

524
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:57,034
Your boss
at the grocery store?

525
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,037
And do you exercise
with Mr. Cheney?

526
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,771
Every day at work.

527
00:29:05,313 --> 00:29:08,305
And does Mr. Cheney
pull his pants down, too?

528
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:12,608
It hurt.

529
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:21,193
Mr. Cheney said
it would stop hurting
when I could do it better.

530
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,533
I try to help Katie,
and this is the thanks I get?

531
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,840
Yeah, she told us all about
your exercise classes,
doing push-ups on your Iap.

532
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:41,211
The only exercise Katie and I
ever did was task repetition.

533
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:44,217
That's how you train
disabled people to function
in a work environment.

534
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:47,277
Dropping your pants
is part of the curriculum?

535
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:50,421
People Iike Katie
can't distinguish
reality from fantasy.

536
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:52,083
I don't' know where
she's getting this from.

537
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,526
She got it from you, Abe.
Same place she got her baby.

538
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:57,860
What?
Yeah. She's carrying
your Iove child.

539
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,889
That's ridiculous.

540
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,696
Good, then we can
clear this right up.

541
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:02,895
Just tell me how.

542
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,598
You supply us
with a DNA sample,
we compare it to the baby's,

543
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:08,506
and this is all over
with our sincerest apology.

544
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:12,035
Apologize to my attorney.

The second we said the word
"pregnancy" he Iawyered up.

Katie's mother is taking her
for the chorionic villus test.

sample, call me. I'II get

Yes.

550
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:30,091
For you.

551
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:32,932
I'm being served.
For what?

552
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,729
I just deliver them.

553
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:39,502
AIex, Huang just called.
He got served with a subpoena
and wanted to warn you.

554
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:41,405
You're about 10 seconds
too Iate.

555
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:42,874
What's it say?

556
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:45,705
Scott Lucas's attorney
is calling on Huang and I
to testify

557
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,941
that Katie is competent
to keep her baby.

558
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,277
Why you and not us?

559
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,478
Lucas knows I was
in the room with Huang
when he evaluated Katie.

560
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:56,785
He wants the judge to hear
from an attorney and a shrink
that Katie is competent.

561
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:02,395
It's no problem.

562
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,091
This clearly compromises
the integrity of an ongoing
criminal investigation.

563
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,567
I'II make the subpoena
go away.

564
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:11,332
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

565
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,873
It is if you want to take
Katie Tolliver's rapist
to trial.

566
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:16,569
Katie's mother wants her
to abort the baby.

567
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:18,976
Maybe that is something
Katie should decide
for herself.

568
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:22,675
You want to be a crusader
for victims' rights,
go work for Social Services.

569
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,048
Your job is to
prosecute crime.

570
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:27,548
Katie has already
been victimized once.

571
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:30,489
My testimony can prevent her
from being victimized
a second time.

572
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,824
You represent the People
of the State of New York,
not Katie Tolliver.

573
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,996
Whether Katie gets to keep
her baby is between her
and her mother.

574
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:41,865
I do have a duty
to the victim.
To convict her rapist.

575
00:31:41,936 --> 00:31:44,632
She's found competent,
you're going to Iose.

576
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:48,297
Cheney's Iawyer will get her
to say she knew what she
was doing, that she Iiked it.

577
00:31:48,376 --> 00:31:52,574
He'II destroy her
on the stand.
Don't Iet this happen.

578
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:57,383
You're jeopardizing
the rape case.

579
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:03,121
Oh, no, you are.
You and Scott Lucas.
You should be talking to him.

580
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,350
Lucas will drop his challenge
to your guardianship

581
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:10,295
if you agree not to terminate
Katie's pregnancy.

582
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:16,863
I can't do that.
Katie needs this abortion
and to have her tubes tied

583
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:18,735
so that this
doesn't happen again.

584
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,797
What about what Katie wants?

585
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:25,039
I know that you think
I'm cruel, Miss Cabot,
but I Iove my daughter.

586
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,810
Maybe I should have Iet Katie
take sex education,

587
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:31,374
but I knew
she couldn't understand.

588
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:35,083
Why do you need Katie
to be so dependent?

589
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:43,086
I have sacrificed everything
to be a good mother.

590
00:32:43,164 --> 00:32:46,099
Including Katie's right
to Iead her own Iife.

591
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:04,277
Our detectives found Katie
Tolliver and her boyfriend
Danny Jordan in a hotel.

592
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,949
They were preparing
for Katie's baby.

593
00:33:07,021 --> 00:33:08,454
CALDWELL: Do you know how
they were handling it?

594
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:11,923
CABOT: From the detectives'
report, it appears the room
was immaculate.

595
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:14,621
Katie had purchased diapers.
She was cooking dinner.

596
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:16,458
They offered the detectives
chocolate milk.

597
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,966
And Katie had also applied
for a job. Is that correct?

598
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:22,531
Yes. At a nearby delicatessen.

599
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,199
She and Danny filled out
the application together.

600
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:28,605
Now, Miss Cabot,
you could have
declined to testify

601
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,371
because of your
open rape case.

602
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:32,477
Why didn't you?

603
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:36,778
Our evidence indicates that
Katie has the coping skills
not only to Iive on her own

604
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:39,285
and to care for a child,
but to make the decision

605
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,480
whether or not
to have that child.

606
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:43,753
Thank you, Counselor.

607
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:48,557
Respondent's exhibit four,
Counselor.

608
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,592
Recognize it?

609
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,994
It's a DD5
written by Detective Benson.

610
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:59,631
Yes, about Katie's interview
at Central Park Zoo
at which you were present.

611
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:02,675
PIease read
the highlighted passage.

612
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:06,769
"The victim
could not articulate
what happened to her

613
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:10,180
"and expressed
unconditional compliance
to authority figures"'

614
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:13,880
Now, Miss Cabot,
do you truly believe
that someone

615
00:34:13,954 --> 00:34:18,516
who cannot accurately
describe being attacked
can take care of a child?

616
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:21,026
Objection.
Overruled.

617
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:24,326
Many high-functioning women
cannot describe
the details of a rape.

618
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,457
You're taking it
completely out of context.

619
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,332
How many children do you have,
Miss Cabot?

620
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:31,929
None.

621
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:35,567
And have you ever taken care
of a child with special needs
Iike Katie?

622
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:37,133
No, I haven't.

623
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:41,642
Do you think buying diapers
six months before the birth

624
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:42,943
demonstrates good judgment?

625
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:44,780
Objection.
Withdrawn.

626
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:48,481
Did you know that Katie
once set fire
to her mother's apartment

627
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:50,786
by trying to use the stove?

628
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:53,520
I set fire to my own stove
Iast year, Counselor.

629
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:57,027
But, no, I didn't know that.

630
00:34:57,098 --> 00:35:01,797
And yet you sit here today
saying you know more
about what Katie's capable of

631
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:02,961
than her own mother.

632
00:35:03,037 --> 00:35:06,131
Your Honor...
Withdrawn.
No further questions.

633
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:12,707
Despite her IQ,
Katie's what we call
high-functioning.

634
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,044
She has the ability
to process new information

635
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:17,209
and to integrate it
into her daily Iife.

636
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:21,380
In your expert opinion,
Doctor, would Katie
have been as vulnerable

637
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,787
if her mother had
taught her about sex?

638
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:28,418
Any woman can be sexually
assaulted, but, yes, Katie
was more vulnerable to rape

639
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,896
because she didn't know
what was happening to her.

640
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:34,059
Is sex education offered
at Katie's day program?

641
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:36,463
Yes, it is,
but she never took it.

642
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:38,198
CALDWELL: Tell us why,
if you know.

643
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:41,264
It's my understanding
that her mother
refused to give consent.

644
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:44,334
Doctor, could Katie
care for a child?

645
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:48,682
With the proper education,
social service support
and case management,

646
00:35:48,749 --> 00:35:49,807
yes.

647
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,215
Thank you.

648
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:56,682
Doctor, what is your overall
conclusion regarding
Katie's competence

649
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:58,452
to consent to sex?

650
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:02,657
Katie didn't know what sex was
and therefore was incapable
of consenting.

651
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,928
So she is not capable
of making decisions
that affect her Iife.

652
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,694
That's not what I said.

653
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:11,033
She is capable
of making decisions
and choices

654
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:12,834
based on
the proper information.

655
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:16,343
How much time
did you spend with Katie?
About two-and-a-half hours.

656
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,811
Did you observe her
at her home?
No, at her day center.

657
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,180
So, Doctor Huang,
your in-depth assessment
is based solely

658
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:25,946
on having talked to her
in a vacuum.

659
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,547
CALDWELL: Objection.
Withdrawn.
No further questions.

660
00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:36,725
Katie, do you Iove your mama?

661
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:40,791
Yes, she's gonna
be the grandma.

662
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:43,563
Does she Iet you
do the Iaundry?

663
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:46,162
No, she says
I mess up the clothes.

664
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:49,507
She doesn't Iet you use
the stove, either, does she?

665
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:52,808
There was a fire.
Mama says it's dangerous.

666
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:55,948
But Danny taught me.

667
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:58,416
I made soup.

668
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:02,150
Danny wants you to have
the baby, too, doesn't he?

669
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:04,655
We got diapers and bottles.

670
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:07,693
He's gonna show me
how to give baby the bath.

671
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:12,488
I can do this, Mama.
I can do Iots of things.

672
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,033
Katie, how do you change
a baby's diaper?

673
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:21,004
I didn't Iearn that yet.

674
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,009
Do you know
how to feed a baby?

675
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:27,374
No, but I can.

676
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:31,312
What do you do
when a baby has a fever?

677
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,486
I don't know.

678
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:37,280
You don't really know
how to be a mommy, do you?

679
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,658
I can Iearn.
Danny will help me.

680
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:45,688
But you can't do it
by yourself, can you?

681
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:57,901
Stop! Stop this.

682
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:10,589
Katie's mother is giving up
her guardianship.

683
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,821
Now that Katie is competent,
our rape case against Abe
Cheney is out the window.

684
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:15,327
My boss is gonna have my ass.

685
00:38:15,396 --> 00:38:18,661
Your boss is wrong.
DNA is back.
Cheney's the father.

686
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:21,098
Convicting him of rape
is another story.

687
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:23,533
Cheney's attorney
is going to use
my testimony to argue

688
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:26,539
that Katie not only
understood what sex was
but consented.

689
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:29,974
Katie was in his office
three days a week for their
personal training sessions.

690
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,511
Somebody must have
seen her go in there.

691
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:34,979
Or maybe she told someone
about it at work.
We just need to talk to Katie.

692
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:37,950
Do you really think her mother
is gonna Iet you
anywhere near her?

693
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:41,351
Well, maybe if we tell her
we've got good news
for a change.

694
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,961
Your grandchild does not have
Down syndrome.

695
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:52,759
Oh, thank God.

696
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:58,064
But you didn't need
to meet us here
just to tell us that.

697
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:03,306
We might Iose the rape case
against Cheney unless
we can talk to Katie.

698
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:14,216
Katie, EIIiot and OIivia
want to ask you
some questions.

699
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:15,312
Hi!

700
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:18,449
Is that all right?
Sure.

701
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:22,961
Hey, Katie!
Hey, OIivia!

702
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,054
How you doing?
Okay.

703
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:27,862
Good. Katie, I know
that it was a secret,

704
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:31,871
but did you tell anybody
about exercising
with Mr. Cheney?

705
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:34,273
No, he'd get mad at me.

706
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:37,476
Did he ever
get mad at you before?
Once.

707
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:39,375
Once. While you were
exercising?

708
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:44,008
No, when I saw Mr. Cheney
exercising with Maryanne.

709
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:45,483
He yelled at me.

710
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:50,285
Exercising with Maryanne?
Does she work
at the store, too?

711
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:52,791
Yes. She Iets me
play with Julie.

712
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:56,296
Who's Julie?
Her baby girl.

713
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,037
What's she doing here?

714
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:10,372
You do have a right
to confront your accuser.

715
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:12,969
Katie, I am...
Not a word, Abe.

716
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:16,144
The DNA results came back.

717
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:19,208
Congratulations, Mr. Cheney.
You're having a boy.

718
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:20,514
We'II take sexual misconduct.

719
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,521
No way your client walks
on a misdemeanor.

720
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:23,783
Come on, Counselor,

721
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:26,826
you don't want to
embarrass Katie in court
a second time, do you?

722
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:30,660
She never said "no,"
she enjoyed it,
she kept coming back for more.

723
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:34,963
Here's what I'm offering.
One count of rape two for
Katie. He does 10 years.

724
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:38,493
We'II take
our chances in court.
I thought you might say that.

725
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,369
Now what are you up to?

726
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:42,068
Recognize any of these?

727
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:48,179
CABOT: These are children
you fathered with women
who worked in your markets,

728
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:50,842
three of whom were underage
at the time.

729
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:52,474
We went through
your financials, Mr. Cheney.

730
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:55,351
You've been paying off
the mothers for their silence.

731
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:58,018
And now you're
gonna pay a Iot more.

732
00:40:59,993 --> 00:41:01,358
Petition for child support?

733
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:03,726
Five more on the way
from the other mothers.

734
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:08,291
That's six kids. Each receives
17% of your chain
of grocery stores,

735
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:11,201
your personal fortune,
everything you own.

736
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,670
Your money is going to take
care of Katie and her child
for the rest of their Iives.
