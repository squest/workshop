1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,066
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:09,785
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

3
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:11,034
In New York City,

4
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:14,726
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:17,572
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:19,543
These are their stories.

7
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:37,876
Can I help you?

8
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:42,981
I want to report a rape.

9
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:46,147
Okay. Let's go
someplace private, huh?

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,484
Can you tell me what happened?

11
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:58,997
It's okay, Megan.
I'm just here to help.

12
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:06,378
He followed me
to my apartment last night.

13
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:10,061
I don't know how
he got in the building,

14
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:14,155
but when I opened my door
he pushed his way in.

15
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:20,626
And then what happened?

16
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,248
Megan?

17
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:28,094
I told him to leave

18
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:31,634
and that I never wanted
to see him again,

19
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,748
but he slammed the door.

20
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:38,711
Oh, God.

21
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:42,855
Can you tell me who did this to you?

22
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:48,698
Megan, is it your boyfriend?

23
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,634
He's my father.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/09/28

37
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,362
It started when I was
in the first grade.

38
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,813
Stroking, touching.

39
00:02:56,057 --> 00:03:00,512
He'd help me undress for bed,
and sometimes he'd take off his shirt

40
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:03,227
and then his pants.

41
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:09,763
When I was 12,
he put himself...

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,539
Take your time.

43
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,506
He told me not to cry.

44
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:23,287
He'd show me these horrible pictures.

45
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,771
He said that that was how
daddies loved their little girls.

46
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,208
And this has been
going on ever since?

47
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,898
No, he stopped
after I got my period.

48
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:36,964
- How long ago was that?
- When I was 14.

49
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:45,003
Did anything sexual happen last night?

50
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:48,762
No, but we had a horrible fight.

51
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,899
If he didn't have to catch a plane,
who knows what he would have done?

52
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,559
I'm not going to lie to you, Megan.

53
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:57,926
It's going to be very difficult to prove
a four-year-old rape.

54
00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,099
And we can't charge him
for the earlier abuse

55
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,648
because the statute of limitation
only extends back five years.

56
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:07,140
What about Lily?

57
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:09,954
Who's Lily?

58
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:12,762
My little sister.
She's seven.

59
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:16,005
That's the same age I was
when he started molesting me.

60
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,461
Well, did you see him
do anything to her?

61
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:25,042
Yesterday afternoon I went to
my parents' to do my laundry,

62
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,895
and I walked in on them.

63
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:30,557
And what did you see?

64
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:37,548
He was touching her
just like he used to touch me.

65
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,510
Hey, Captain, we got some background
on Megan's father.

66
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,198
I'm on my way to the Mayor's luncheon,
so let's make this quick.

67
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:47,011
Okay. Evan Ramsey runs
Southerland Pharmaceuticals,

68
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:50,267
and he just donated a wing
to the East Harlem Children's Hospital.

69
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,845
Well, if his daughter's telling the truth,

70
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:53,681
they're not gonna be hanging
his picture on their wall.

71
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,511
Rebecca Southerland is the wife.

72
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,402
She's also the daughter of
the company's founding father.

73
00:04:57,402 --> 00:05:00,492
So he married into the social register.
Any other kids?

74
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:02,730
Yeah, two. Jody, 15,
and Lily, seven.

75
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,914
Lily is the one that Megan says
he's molesting.

76
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:07,247
So, basically,
we're working two cases here.

77
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,473
A rape just this side
of the statute of limitations,

78
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:11,771
and the possible molestation
of a seven-year-old.

79
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,483
Munch and Fin are checking
with Children's Services

80
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:15,103
to see if the family's
got any priors.

81
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:16,701
Well, where is the mother in all this?

82
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,687
She and Megan aren't
on speaking terms.

83
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,039
We're off to see the mother right now.

84
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,120
Good. Get back to me when you
have something to talk about.

85
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,720
I've been married to Evan for 19 years,
had three children with him.

86
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,059
I'd certainly know
if he was raping one of them.

87
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:32,295
You've always had a blind spot
where he's concerned.

88
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:33,913
Dad, please.

89
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:37,191
Megan's lashing out.
She's a very angry young woman.

90
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:40,275
Where do you think
all this anger came from?

91
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:42,330
From that therapist
she's been seeing.

92
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,802
- What therapist?
- Dr. Wharton.

93
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,539
Megan started seeing her
when she went to Columbia.

94
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,556
Since then, my daughter's
become an expert

95
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:53,479
on what she calls 
"our family dysfunction."

96
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,188
I've tried talking to her,
but she just shuts me out.

97
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:58,804
We've seen these
kind of cases before,

98
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:03,387
and it's very difficult for daughters
to share this with their mothers.

99
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:07,426
It isn't the first time she's made up
little stories to get attention.

100
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:09,856
Has she ever
made up anything like this?

101
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:11,944
Nothing this outlandish,

102
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:17,158
but she has stretched the bounds of
reality to get what she wanted.

103
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:19,961
God knows what she's been
telling that therapist.

104
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:22,807
We're going to need to
speak with Jody and Lily.

105
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,972
I don't see why that's necessary.

106
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:27,272
It's routine. Whenever allegations
like these are made,

107
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:29,936
we'd like to talk to everyone
in the family.

108
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:33,202
Now she's putting her sisters
into the middle of her little drama.

109
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,903
When can we talk to them?

110
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:37,748
- They're in school.
- Where?

111
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,826
I'll not have you embarrass them
in front of their friends.

112
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:43,363
Then bring them down
to our precinct after school.

113
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:47,484
The sooner we can talk to them,
the sooner we can close this up.

114
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:50,540
They'll be there.

115
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:55,278
Whole Life Recovery Center
92 West 78th Street
Tuesday, February 13

116
00:06:55,278 --> 00:07:00,035
Megan came to me suffering
from bulimia and depression.

117
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,328
What was she depressed about?

118
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:09,333
Eating disorders often signal
a deeper emotional trauma.

119
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,291
In Megan's case,
it was childhood incest.

120
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,447
- When did Megan tell you this?
- Only recently.

121
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:18,298
She built a wall between
herself and her father,

122
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:23,310
but after months of hard work
the floodgates finally opened

123
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,798
and the truth came out.

124
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:26,537
Why didn't you report the abuse?

125
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:29,497
Megan's an adult. I couldn't
break confidentiality.

126
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:33,312
The only reason I'm talking to you is
because she gave me permission.

127
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:35,362
What about her younger sisters?

128
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:39,763
I repeatedly asked her if she
thought they were at risk,

129
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:44,218
and she always said no,
until yesterday.

130
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:50,242
She called and she said that
she'd reported her father for abusing Lily.

131
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:56,520
Is Megan emotionally ready
for the strain of a police investigation?

132
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,175
She's still healing,
but she came to you,

133
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:06,867
so that tells me she's
on the road to recovery.

134
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,904
I had to go to the basement
to dig up this file.

135
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:11,215
How long has it been there?

136
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:13,847
Seven years,
when Megan Ramsey was 11.

137
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,239
Who reported it?

138
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:18,427
A resident in the emergency
room at Mercy General.

139
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:22,147
Her mother brought her in for vaginal
bleeding after a bicycle accident.

140
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,815
Megan told them she'd been
having trouble urinating,

141
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:27,691
and when he noticed bruising
on her backside, he called.

142
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,578
Your investigation
turn up anything?

143
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:33,303
Megan said she got the bruises
riding horses at her grandfather's farm.

144
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,133
What about the other problem?

145
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,801
We contacted her pediatrician.

146
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:39,797
He told us Megan had
a minor urinary tract infection

147
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:41,927
from taking too many bubble baths.

148
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:45,498
After a series of follow-up visits,
the case was closed.

149
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:46,963
Thank you.

150
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:49,961
Our complaining witness appears to
have a history of emotional problems.

151
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,166
She's an incest victim.

152
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,313
Doesn't necessarily make her
an unreliable witness.

153
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,416
This man is a community leader.

154
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,848
He's known for his good works
and political clout.

155
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:59,433
So let's make sure we have
our ammunition

156
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,565
before going to war with his lawyers.

157
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:04,683
- Mind if I join the party?
- Well, it depends on what you brought.

158
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,492
Evan Ramsey was investigated
for child abuse against Megan
seven years ago,

159
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:11,656
but the case worker found no evidence
to support the charge.

160
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,520
Rebecca didn't mention
anything about that.

161
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,984
Well, it wouldn't be the first time a wife
chose her husband over her children.

162
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:18,112
Since Evan's out of town,

163
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:21,239
find out as much as you can
before he gets back.

164
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:23,000
They're here.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,434
Okay, separate rooms.

166
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:26,741
See if either one
confirms Megan's story.

167
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,321
Meanwhile, I'll see if I can
wear down Mom with my charm.

168
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:34,292
So, Lily, do you spend
a lot of time together with your daddy?

169
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:40,700
Well, sometimes we go to the park
and we ride the horses.

170
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,875
What else do you do together?

171
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,571
He reads stories to me

172
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:51,741
- and we play games.
- Yeah? What kind of games?

173
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:00,827
What is it, honey?

174
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:04,458
Why is everybody mad at my daddy?

175
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,469
Well, what makes you think
that we're mad?

176
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:09,630
Megan said he was doing bad things.

177
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,407
What kind of bad things?

178
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,776
I don't know.

179
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,253
Lily, does your dad ever
do things that you don't like?

180
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:25,280
Well, sometimes he yells
and says bad words.

181
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,566
What else does he do
that you don't like?

182
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:29,296
Nothing.

183
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,870
My daddy loves me.

184
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,322
I don't understand.

185
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:36,724
Well, did your dad ever
touch you in a way that,

186
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:38,372
you know, made you feel uncomfortable?

187
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,462
No. He's a great dad.
He'd never do anything like that.

188
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:42,881
How about with your sisters?

189
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:45,908
No. Sometimes he and Megan
would argue,

190
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:47,924
but he was just trying
to keep her out of trouble.

191
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:49,715
Yeah? What kind of trouble?

192
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,558
He said her boyfriend was bad news.

193
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:56,166
She thought he was
trying to control her life.

194
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,807
How's his relationship with Lily?

195
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:01,003
He never yells at her.

196
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:03,086
He spend a lot of time with her?

197
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:05,201
I guess.

198
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:08,228
So what do they do
when they hang out?

199
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:11,008
They go to the park
and he reads to her.

200
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:13,817
- Just the usual stuff.
- Usual stuff?

201
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:16,327
Anything else?

202
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:20,889
Go on.

203
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:25,301
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- So tell me anyway.

204
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,985
Sometimes he goes
to her room at night,

205
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:32,534
and I hear crying.

206
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:34,993
And?

207
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:40,238
He still gives her baths
with the door locked.

208
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:41,866
And a few nights ago,

209
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:45,196
I woke up in the middle of the night
to get a drink of water,

210
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:48,047
and I saw him changing Lily's sheets.

211
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:52,082
She was crying in the corner
with her bottoms off.

212
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:57,139
Dad was acting weird.
He said she wet the bed.

213
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,268
But...

214
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:04,824
But what?

215
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:10,186
She hasn't wet the bed
since she was two.

216
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:18,508
I don't believe this.
It can't be true.

217
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:21,583
Mrs. Ramsey, I know this isn't easy,
but we're grasping at straws.

218
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,571
I've heard enough.

219
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,719
If you give us permission
to search Lily's room,

220
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,665
we just might come up
with some answers.

221
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:29,050
I can't take this anymore.

222
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:39,719
Mrs. Ramsey, there's someone
here to see you.

223
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,110
Megan.

224
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,726
Detective Benson told me
you'd be here.

225
00:12:54,863 --> 00:13:00,129
It's not true. It can't be.

226
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:04,737
He raped me, Mother.

227
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:10,195
I was 12 years old.
Where were you?

228
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,379
Why didn't you help me?

229
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:18,845
I didn't know.

230
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:22,987
I swear to God I didn't know.

231
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:30,773
We're going to need physical
examinations on Jody and Lily,

232
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:33,416
and permission to search your house.

233
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,163
Do whatever you need to do.

234
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:40,613
I want my children safe.

235
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,409
He'll be home any minute.

236
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,955
We'll handle the introductions.

237
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,623
Olivia!

238
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:56,002
What do you got?

239
00:13:57,582 --> 00:14:00,767
Kiddie porn right under Lily's mattress.

240
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,417
There you go.

241
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,909
Got something else, Detectives.

242
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,305
Men's underwear.

243
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,838
Rebecca?

244
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:11,478
- Everything okay?
- Bag it all. / You got it.

245
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:13,884
What the hell is going on here?

246
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:18,026
Evan Ramsey, New York City detectives.
We'd like you to come with us.

247
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,322
I'm not going anywhere
till somebody tells me...

248
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:21,452
- We just want to ask you a few questions.
- Look, you have no right to...

249
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,487
Please, Mr. Ramsey, for the sake
of your daughters,

250
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,161
let's not do this in front of them.

251
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,587
I didn't rape my daughter.

252
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,600
- That's not what Megan says.
- She's angry and confused.

253
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,783
About what?

254
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,834
I threatened to pull the plug
on her college tuition

255
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,859
if she didn't drop that boyfriend
and start buckling down.

256
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,805
So she's crying rape
to get back at you?

257
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,975
I have no idea why she's doing this.

258
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,242
I have tried to get through to her,

259
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:56,530
and she just keeps pulling
further away from me.

260
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,552
I mean, I... I try to hug her,
she recoils like I'm contagious.

261
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:05,034
She said she saw you fondling
Lily in her own bed.

262
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,926
I was helping her put on her pajamas.

263
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,903
What about the visits to her room
in the middle of the night?

264
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:13,745
- She has nightmares, for God's sake.
- Nightmares, huh?

265
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,778
I wonder if these caused them.

266
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:17,495
What?

267
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,040
These are disgusting.

268
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,246
Well, we found them in Lily's room,
along with a pair of your underwear.

269
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:24,442
This is ridiculous.

270
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:26,507
The pictures were printed
on a digital printer

271
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,191
just like the one
next to your computer.

272
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,638
I only use that computer for business.

273
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,989
Yeah? That's some business.

274
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:34,333
Look, I know this has gotta
come as a big shock to you,

275
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,584
but on some level also a relief.

276
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:39,346
Now you get the chance
to clear the decks, get some help.

277
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:42,035
Megan has already
broken her silence.

278
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,926
It's only a matter of time
before your other daughters join her.

279
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:46,432
I haven't done anything wrong.

280
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:49,197
Do you have any idea what they do
to child molesters in prison?

281
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:51,053
I'm sure that they'll grow
very attached to you

282
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,980
once they find out why you're there.

283
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,601
- I want my lawyer.
- Fine.

284
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:59,697
Do we have anything
to corroborate the rape?

285
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,234
Only Megan's testimony.

286
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:03,593
Any physical evidence is long gone.

287
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:04,818
And Lily?

288
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:08,314
Medical exam showed vaginal irritation,
but nothing conclusive.

289
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:10,600
Jody's was negative.

290
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,905
That leaves us with the photos
and the underwear.

291
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,713
But Lily still hasn't provided testimony
linking them to her alleged abuse.

292
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:18,329
Megan passed the poly.

293
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,757
You know that's inadmissible.

294
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,267
It confirms her story.

295
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:25,227
We let him go, he goes
right back home to his daughters.

296
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:29,679
All right.
Arrest him for the rape.

297
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:35,163
- Where's my lawyer?
- He knows where to find you.

298
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,488
- I want to know why.
- Rebecca.

299
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:37,970
- Rebecca, come with me.
- No, let me do this!

300
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,827
- Wasn't I enough?
- How could you even think that?

301
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:41,522
- I trusted you!
- My God, look at me!

302
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:43,584
Do you think that
I could ever hurt them?

303
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:46,647
- You disgust me!
- Rebecca! Please...

304
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:48,319
Don't do this!

305
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,583
Stop!

306
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:58,263
Arraignment Part 44
Thursday, February 15

307
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:00,483
Mr. Ramsey, how do you plead?

308
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:01,605
Not guilty.

309
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:05,368
Your Honor, the defendant's financial
resources alone make him a serious flight risk.

310
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:08,653
Your Honor, Mr. Ramsey's contributions
to the community are well known.

311
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,208
He's not going anywhere
and he's a danger to no one.

312
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,073
Except perhaps to his daughters.

313
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:18,501
I'm setting bail at $500,000,
or $5 million surety.

314
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,624
Your Honor, given the nature
of the offenses charged,

315
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,492
the People request an order of protection

316
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:24,693
barring the defendant from entering
the family residence

317
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:28,231
or from coming within
100 yards of his children.

318
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:30,041
So ordered.

319
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,488
So I hear that your daddy reads to you.

320
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,890
Yeah.

321
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,994
What's your favorite story?

322
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:41,240
I took her to see
Megan's therapist.

323
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,207
Afterwards, she rattled off the symptoms
like a shopping list.

324
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:48,625
The crying, the sleepless nights.

325
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:56,439
She says Lily's blocking it all out
because it's too much for her to bear.

326
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:59,382
It's so clear now.

327
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,293
Why didn't I see it?

328
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:06,370
Because he went through a lot of trouble
to make sure that you didn't.

329
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,713
Can I talk to her?

330
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,105
Please.

331
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:13,150
Well?

332
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,968
She hasn't disclosed anything.

333
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,163
She's scared.

334
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,387
Wouldn't you be?

335
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,534
She knows her father's in trouble
and she's the cause.

336
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,369
If we don't get her testimony
by day after tomorrow,

337
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,894
I can't indict her case with Megan's.

338
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,550
Megan's case can't stand on its own.

339
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,384
I'll do the best I can,
but it's a slow dance,

340
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:30,492
and I have to follow her lead.

341
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:33,662
Police Crime Lab
1 Centre Street
Thursday, February 15

342
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:36,850
DNA analysis matched hair and
fluids in the underwear to Evan Ramsey,

343
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,862
but we found nothing in the bed sheets
or Lily's nightclothes.

344
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:42,398
What about the pictures?

345
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:44,879
Even with ninhydrin,
we couldn't raise any prints.

346
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:46,979
In other words, we got a big fat zero.

347
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:49,143
Not quite.
Take a look at the photo.

348
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:52,743
The border was found
in a trash container in Lily's bathroom.

349
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:56,006
See how it matches the cut pattern
on the bottom?

350
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,708
Look at the date.
February 13.

351
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,830
Yeah, it's the date
they were downloaded.

352
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,285
Tuesday.

353
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:03,775
You thinking what I'm thinking?

354
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,947
Evan was in Baltimore on Tuesday.

355
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,103
I'm computer illiterate.
I can't even turn the damn thing on.

356
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:12,558
What about your children?

357
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,656
You can't be serious.

358
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:17,502
Did it ever occur to you that the date
might have been set wrong?

359
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:18,675
We'll check that out.

360
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:21,332
But in the meantime, we need
to cover all of our bases.

361
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:22,525
My kids were at school,

362
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,267
and I was at my lawyer's
office filing for divorce.

363
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,493
And where was Megan?

364
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:27,825
Megan doesn't live here.

365
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:30,680
- But she has a key.
- Yeah.

366
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,798
And where were you
Tuesday morning?

367
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,695
I was at the grocery store.

368
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:38,789
So no one can say for sure
whether Megan came home or not.

369
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,808
All I know is Megan has a chemistry class
every Tuesday morning.

370
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:43,370
Did she go?

371
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,348
You'd have to ask her.

372
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:47,291
I dropped chemistry.

373
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,674
I haven't been able to
concentrate very well this semester.

374
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:51,484
So what have you been doing
with your Tuesday mornings?

375
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:53,992
I've been working with a tutor, trying to
catch up on my other classes.

376
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,974
- This tutor got a name?
- Michael Tobin.

377
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:58,999
- Were you with him last Tuesday?
- No.

378
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,027
Thought you just said
you had a tutor.

379
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:03,030
He was my boyfriend.
We broke up last week.

380
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,468
So where were you then?

381
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:06,629
- In the library studying.
- Anyone with you?

382
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:08,581
Yeah, lots of people.
It's mid-terms.

383
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:12,920
Look, I'm going to be late for a class.
Can we talk about this later?

384
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,971
You gotta be kidding me.

385
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:18,633
Hard drives don't lie.

386
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,241
This one shows nothing but spreadsheets,
business correspondence,

387
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,411
and a couple of hits
on a stock-trading website.

388
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:25,978
- What about his laptop?
- Clean as a whistle.

389
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:28,141
So his account was accessed
by another computer.

390
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,374
Someone who knows
his password.

391
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:32,386
Can you give us the location
of the download?

392
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:35,722
You'd have to talk to the ISP for that.

393
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,692
If Evan didn't download
those pictures, then who did?

394
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:39,977
And why?

395
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:42,896
The only one who can tell us
what happened in that bedroom is Lily.

396
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:45,286
She's not talking.
At least not to us.

397
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,305
But she did talk
to Megan's therapist.

398
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:50,236
Does Dr. Wharton accept walk-ins?

399
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:52,652
I'm not surprised she's resisting.

400
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,587
We really need her testimony.

401
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,009
Megan's isn't enough?

402
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:58,980
Without Lily to corroborate,
it's just Evan's word against Megan's.

403
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,175
Excuse me. / Our psychiatrist thinks
that Lily's protecting her father.

404
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:05,085
She may feel more comfortable
talking to you.

405
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:08,098
I've only seen her once,
but we did develop a rapport.

406
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:09,670
I'll clear my schedule.

407
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,531
Well, we appreciate that.

408
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:13,932
Sure. Okay.

409
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,512
All right, bye.

410
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,412
Munch checked with Evan's
internet service provider.

411
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:24,060
The kiddie porn was downloaded to
a terminal at the student library at Columbia.

412
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:29,247
Those pictures were downloaded
while your father was out of town.

413
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,470
You put the pictures
under the mattress.

414
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,103
No. / You planted your father's
underwear in the sheets.

415
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:37,257
- No.
- Why did you do it, Megan?

416
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,086
He was going to
get away with it again.

417
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:43,158
Well, tell us the truth.
Maybe we can help.

418
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:45,458
No one can help.

419
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,668
He's too powerful.

420
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:51,033
When he came to my apartment,

421
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:55,775
he threatened to sue my therapist
and send me to a mental hospital.

422
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,532
Who would believe me then?

423
00:21:57,532 --> 00:22:03,966
Some crazy girl telling wild stories
about her sex fiend father?

424
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:08,519
I had to stop him. I couldn't
let it happen again.

425
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,873
Motion Hearing Part 65
Tuesday, February 20

426
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:16,596
In light of these developments,

427
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:19,026
we submit the People have no case,

428
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:23,045
and therefore move that the charges
against my client be dismissed.

429
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:25,211
Your Honor, the evidence
in question has no bearing

430
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,172
on the rape case
pending before this court.

431
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:31,063
But it does bring into serious question
the veracity of the complaining witness.

432
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,880
With no physical evidence
to support her allegations,

433
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,706
the People have failed to meet
their obligations under the law.

434
00:22:36,706 --> 00:22:39,481
Have the People
anything new to present?

435
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,324
No, Your Honor.

436
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:43,719
Then I have to agree
with Mr. Wilmington.

437
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:45,540
Case dismissed.

438
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,161
Mr. Ramsey, you're free to go
with the court's apology.

439
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:58,768
Megan, honey, I know
you didn't mean to do this.

440
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:05,089
I want you moved out
by the end of the week.

441
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:15,974
What a mess.

442
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:17,723
If Megan hadn't screwed up
the investigation,

443
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:19,481
we might have nailed him.

444
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:21,397
Stabler.

445
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:23,368
She's trying to protect her sister.

446
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,718
Yeah, well, the road to hell's
paved with good intentions.

447
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:27,213
It doesn't mean she wasn't raped.

448
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,785
Now we'll never prove it.

449
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:29,998
And if she's telling the truth,

450
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:32,158
that means that he got away
with it all over again.

451
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:34,708
Not quite.
That was the Captain.

452
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,176
Evan Ramsey was murdered.

453
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,795
Dropped him on the spot.
Single gunshot to the chest.

454
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:49,485
Powder burns
indicate close range.

455
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:51,000
When?

456
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,856
No rigor.
Blood's still pooling.

457
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:55,602
- Within several hours.
- Detectives...

458
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,993
This is Richard Weiss,
one of the company executives.

459
00:23:57,993 --> 00:24:00,060
He discovered the body.

460
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,639
Let's take a walk, Mr. Weiss.

461
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:05,146
We were both working late.

462
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:07,598
About 9:00 I cut out
to grab some dinner.

463
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:11,243
I came back to pick up some
papers and saw the light on.

464
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,598
Went in to say good night,
and there he was,

465
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:15,848
just lying there,
blood everywhere.

466
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:18,343
- About what time was that?
- 10:30, 11:00.

467
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:21,848
- You see anyone else?
- Not a soul.

468
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:26,274
You have any idea
who might have done this?

469
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:28,658
Evan's style put off a lot of people,

470
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:32,641
but no one would do
something like this.

471
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,574
Unless...

472
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,100
Unless what?

473
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,483
Things were pretty tense
between him and his father-in-law.

474
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:39,828
- Charles Southerland?
- Yeah.

475
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:42,503
Ever since Evan took the company public,
the old man's been on a tear,

476
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:45,796
claiming Evan stole the business
he built from the ground up.

477
00:24:45,796 --> 00:24:49,170
The molestation charges
just seemed to add fuel to the fire.

478
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,077
Get him hot enough to do this?

479
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:51,922
I don't know.

480
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:54,659
But this afternoon,
he stormed into Evan's office

481
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,740
- and went into a tirade.
- About what?

482
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,838
He called Evan a rapist.

483
00:24:59,838 --> 00:25:01,166
Told him he wasn't going to
get away with it,

484
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,538
no matter what the courts said.

485
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:03,753
How'd Evan react?

486
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,457
He tried to reason with him.

487
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:07,339
The old man wouldn't listen.

488
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,556
They'd have come to blows if security
hadn't escorted the old guy out.

489
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,608
Ornithoptera priamus poseidon.

490
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:20,017
Cairns Birdwing.
It's quite a rare prize.

491
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:23,258
You don't seem too upset
about your son-in-law's untimely death.

492
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:26,954
If you're asking me if I'm glad
he's dead, the answer is yes.

493
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:29,931
If you're asking me if I killed him,
the answer is no.

494
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:32,609
Although, I'd like to buy
the fellow who did it a drink.

495
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:34,159
Well, it must have stuck in your craw

496
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,184
when the charges against
your son-in-law were dropped.

497
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:39,674
Yes. But things have a way
of working out, don't they?

498
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:41,824
After dinner, where did you
and your daughter go?

499
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,797
I took her home,

500
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:46,064
came back here,

501
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:48,963
poured myself a Scotch,
and went to bed.

502
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:51,362
Evan was killed by a .32 slug.

503
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:54,625
You own a.32 caliber
Derringer, don't you?

504
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,344
Yes.

505
00:25:56,556 --> 00:26:00,237
An LM5 Simmerling
with a scrimshaw handle.

506
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:03,379
- Legally registered.
- We'd like to see it.

507
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,799
Right this way.

508
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,754
I also have an authentic
Revolutionary musket,

509
00:26:09,754 --> 00:26:14,271
a pearl-handled Colt .45
and a World War I Luger.

510
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:17,662
Keep them all in top firing condition, too.

511
00:26:20,654 --> 00:26:22,753
There a problem, Mr. Southerland?

512
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,328
It's gone.

513
00:26:24,328 --> 00:26:25,752
Gone?

514
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,920
My gun.
It's supposed to be in here.

515
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,223
You'd better come with us.

516
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,797
Evan stole your company.

517
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:36,225
He molested your grandchildren.

518
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:38,549
We can certainly understand
why you'd want justice.

519
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:40,539
You've got it all figured out,
don't you?

520
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,203
Company executives heard you arguing
just a few hours before.

521
00:26:43,203 --> 00:26:45,611
And now your.32 caliber
Derringer's missing.

522
00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:47,713
You care to explain that?

523
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,024
Think of your family.

524
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:58,937
After all they've been through, isn't
it time just to put an end to all of this?

525
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:03,886
Don't presume to tell me
about my family, Detective.

526
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:05,982
How does he look?

527
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:08,636
Opportunity, motive,
access to a weapon,

528
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:10,519
but I don't know.

529
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,133
What? / The guy seemed genuinely
surprised that his gun was missing.

530
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,915
I mean, you'd think that if he's
going to murder somebody,

531
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:18,278
he'd at least concoct a plausible
explanation for its disappearance.

532
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:19,987
Yeah, and sometimes they just freeze

533
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:22,363
when they get caught
with their hand in the cookie jar.

534
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:25,817
A CSU conducted another canvass.

535
00:27:25,817 --> 00:27:30,457
Located a .32 caliber
Simmerling Derringer in a sewer drain

536
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:33,134
in the parking structure
of Southerland's office building.

537
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:35,598
They're running a check now.

538
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:42,793
Serial number matches.

539
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:45,015
This is definitely Southerland's.

540
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:50,027
Now, the bullet removed
from Ramsey's body was on the left.

541
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:54,585
The bullet from the water tank
will be on your right.

542
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,395
See the lands and grooves?

543
00:27:57,395 --> 00:28:00,002
Here and here.

544
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:03,376
Identical twins. / You've found
your murder weapon.

545
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:04,468
Any prints?

546
00:28:04,468 --> 00:28:06,592
The water in the gutter
degraded the surface of the gun,

547
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:08,180
making it impossible to lift any.

548
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,599
However, we got a couple of clean ones
from the shell casings.

549
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,558
But unfortunately, Miguel,
they don't match Southerland's prints.

550
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:18,734
You got your weapon,
not your killer.

551
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:21,447
Where were you last night?

552
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:24,806
I had dinner with my father,
then came right home.

553
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:27,742
- What time did you get in?
- Around 9:00.

554
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:29,811
And who else was here?

555
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,821
My daughters
and my housekeeper.

556
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:35,194
- We all went to bed.
- Mom.

557
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:37,919
What are they doing here?

558
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,438
We were just talking to her
about last night.

559
00:28:42,993 --> 00:28:46,476
I'm very sorry for your loss,
but we have to ask you a few questions.

560
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,453
Like what?

561
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:50,071
Where were you between
the hours of 7:00 and 11:00?

562
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:53,123
I picked Jody up from her dance class
and I brought her back here.

563
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:56,886
- Can anyone corroborate that?
- I can.

564
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:58,026
She stayed the night.

565
00:28:58,026 --> 00:29:01,766
After what happened in court,
I wanted all my children here with me.

566
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:04,173
You had no other contact
with your father?

567
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:06,013
I cut my father out of my life.

568
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:10,249
Megan, honey, could you check
on your sisters for me?

569
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,343
Is there a point to these questions?

570
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:17,328
Your daughter planted evidence
to incriminate him.

571
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:19,451
And he raped her until she was 14.

572
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:21,324
Maybe that evens things out.

573
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,904
- What about you?
- What about me?

574
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:25,696
He molested your daughters.

575
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:28,602
His death gives you
a permanent order of protection.

576
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,805
He should burn in hell for
what he did to my daughters,

577
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:33,992
but I didn't kill him.

578
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:37,401
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my children need me.

579
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,603
Marina will see you out.

580
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:44,029
The only people who had access
to Charles' gun collection

581
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:45,381
were his immediate family.

582
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:48,373
Rebecca claims all the kids
were tucked into bed by 9:00.

583
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:51,639
How convenient. A family of suspects
giving each other an airtight alibi.

584
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:53,135
- Except Megan's.
- What you got?

585
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:54,113
Phone records.

586
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:56,438
Someone was placing phone calls
to her father's office

587
00:29:56,438 --> 00:29:58,730
from her car phone
between 9:30 and 10:00.

588
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,520
She was supposed to be fast asleep.

589
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,888
Sounds like Megan's airtight alibi
just sprung a leak.

590
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,077
You've been the Ramsey's
housekeeper for how long?

591
00:30:09,077 --> 00:30:10,038
Ten years.

592
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:12,906
What time did the lady of the house
get in last Tuesday night?

593
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:15,363
- About 9:00.
- You sure?

594
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:17,148
Tuesdays is The New Detectives
on cable.

595
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,312
I was watching when
Mrs. Ramsey came home.

596
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:21,188
She took a sleeping pill
and went to bed.

597
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:23,623
What about the girls?
What time did they come home?

598
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:24,905
Same time.

599
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:27,877
But later they went out.

600
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:29,874
What time did they get back?

601
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:33,243
Charlie Rose was on by then,
so it must have been after 11:00.

602
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:35,069
They say anything?

603
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,378
No.

604
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:39,920
They just went up to Jody's room
and closed the door.

605
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,618
And?

606
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:47,340
And I heard lots of crying.

607
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,304
Mrs. Ramsey...

608
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,287
We're meeting our priest.
Can't this wait?

609
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,204
Sorry, but it can't.

610
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,840
I've already told you
everything I know.

611
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Actually, we're here
to speak with Jody. / Me?

612
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,337
Your housekeeper said you left the house
after your mother went to bed.

613
00:31:03,337 --> 00:31:05,053
Well, she's mistaken.

614
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:08,186
The girls went to bed when I did.
Tell them, Jody.

615
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:09,714
You've already lied to your mother.

616
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:13,229
Don't make it any harder
on yourself by lying now.

617
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:20,431
Daddy had been calling Megan.

618
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,143
She wanted him to admit
what he'd done,

619
00:31:22,143 --> 00:31:24,234
but he said he wouldn't do it
over the phone.

620
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:26,251
So you drove to his office.

621
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,742
What happened
when you got there?

622
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:29,312
Megan went inside.

623
00:31:29,312 --> 00:31:30,370
What about you?

624
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,203
She told me to wait in the car.

625
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:33,675
And then what?

626
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:36,440
A few minutes later,
she came back out and we left.

627
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,754
She say anything
about what happened?

628
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:41,484
No, she didn't want to
talk about it.

629
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,471
We just got in the car
and drove home.

630
00:31:43,471 --> 00:31:45,917
Mom was asleep,
so we went to bed.

631
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:48,312
Why didn't you tell me?

632
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:50,911
We knew you were mad at us
for seeing him,

633
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:53,367
so we lied.

634
00:31:57,076 --> 00:31:58,631
Okay, let's go over that one more time.

635
00:31:58,631 --> 00:31:59,978
I told you, I don't remember.

636
00:31:59,978 --> 00:32:03,048
Megan, you're not doing
yourself any favors here.

637
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:05,843
We have your phone records.
We know that you went to see him.

638
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:08,268
- Just tell us what happened.
- I would tell you if I could.

639
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:10,321
Well, why can't you?

640
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,749
Sometimes I black out.

641
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:14,682
Oh, come on, Megan. You're gonna
have to do better than that.

642
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,927
You took your grandfather's pistol
and you shot your father.

643
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:18,533
- No, I couldn't have.
- Did he threaten you?

644
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,662
I don't remember.

645
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:23,702
I didn't remember I was raped
until a few months ago.

646
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:25,391
Ask my therapist.

647
00:32:25,391 --> 00:32:28,723
She said I couldn't get away from him,
so I pushed out the memory.

648
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:32,718
I wish it had stayed away,
because now I can't forget it.

649
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:37,327
I am no longer at liberty
to discuss Megan's treatment.

650
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,009
But you talked to us before.

651
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:42,042
Megan has decided
not to waive privilege.

652
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:44,959
Well, she's a suspect
in her father's murder.

653
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,416
If you thought she was
going to commit a crime,

654
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,961
you're legally obligated to report it.

655
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:53,230
I have been a therapist
for 15 years, Detective.

656
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,015
I don't need a lecture in ethics.

657
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,944
Okay, can you answer some general
questions about your treatment techniques?

658
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:04,028
I'll try. / How exactly do you
recover buried memories?

659
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:07,638
With intense therapy.

660
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,935
Can you be more specific?

661
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:18,915
Generally, the process begins
by recovering a flashback.

662
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:23,025
A snapshot in time.

663
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:27,654
And slowly, more and more
snapshots appear

664
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:31,501
until the collage becomes
a complete picture.

665
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:35,013
Once the patient faces
what happened to her,

666
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,727
she can begin to heal.

667
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:39,708
How do you know if the patient's
telling the truth?

668
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:45,012
I engage a physician
to administer sodium amytal.

669
00:33:45,012 --> 00:33:47,084
Truth serum.

670
00:33:49,017 --> 00:33:53,259
A tranquilizer that reduces resistance

671
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:57,275
and enables the therapist
to probe for inconsistencies

672
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,318
and verify the memories.

673
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:05,437
Okay, but what if you overlook
your patient's inconsistencies?

674
00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:09,994
I don't overlook them,
Detective, I explore them.

675
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:12,431
I don't shy away
from the tough cases,

676
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:15,858
and I have an exemplary
record of success

677
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:17,687
where others have failed.

678
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:20,353
Is Megan a success story?

679
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:24,535
I think this conversation
has gone on long enough.

680
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:28,837
If you'll excuse me, my next
appointment is waiting.

681
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,285
Well, technically it's called
the false memory syndrome,

682
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:37,866
but I call it the power of
suggestion run amuck.

683
00:34:37,866 --> 00:34:40,706
She said that sodium amytal
verifies memories.

684
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,645
More like creates them.

685
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:45,695
That's why it's fallen out of
favor with most reputable therapists,

686
00:34:45,695 --> 00:34:49,277
but some die-hard advocates
still administer it.

687
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:50,349
How does it work?

688
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:53,272
It places the patient
in a semi-hypnotic state,

689
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:56,024
making them extremely
vulnerable to manipulation.

690
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:59,049
This is especially true
if they're already in a fragile state.

691
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:00,084
Like Megan.

692
00:35:00,084 --> 00:35:03,364
Right. She fits the profile.

693
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:07,238
I remember reading this case in which
a young woman had convinced the police

694
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,991
to dig up a park in search
of bodies of young boys

695
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:11,674
that she claimed her father
had buried there

696
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:13,613
after raping and torturing them.

697
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:16,029
The fact that no such bodies
were ever found did not deter her

698
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:17,712
from believing
that they were still there.

699
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:20,672
And then, later, it was revealed that
the whole thing was planted in her head

700
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:23,411
during a sodium amytal
interview by her therapist.

701
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:25,346
So there's a good chance
that Megan was never raped.

702
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:27,230
More than a chance.

703
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:30,518
These are Megan's medical records.

704
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:35,362
We got a subpoena when she canceled
her physical exam for the third time.

705
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,846
An intact hymen.

706
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,846
She's a virgin.

707
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:44,249
So Megan's memories
of childhood rape...

708
00:35:44,249 --> 00:35:46,711
Are just figments of her
therapist's imagination.

709
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,030
And Evan Ramsey was accused
on spectral evidence.

710
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,368
And we all had a hand in it.

711
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:54,621
However, the forensics
aren't spectral.

712
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:57,154
The lab matched the prints
on the shell casings to Megan's.

713
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,508
What about her state of mind?

714
00:35:58,508 --> 00:36:00,371
Megan believes that she was raped,

715
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:01,909
but none of this would have happened

716
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,709
if that therapist hadn't filled her mind
with a lot of garbage.

717
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:07,396
The therapist didn't
pull the trigger. Megan did.

718
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:10,256
Look, she planted those photographs
and she lied about it.

719
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:12,622
That shows a clear
and logical state of mind.

720
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:14,226
Her fingerprints
are on the shell casings,

721
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:16,523
and her own sister places her
at the scene of the crime.

722
00:36:16,523 --> 00:36:18,326
Jody's not going to want to testify.

723
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:19,478
Well, I'm issuing a subpoena.

724
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:22,116
She'll testify
or she'll be in contempt.

725
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:25,516
Grand Jury Room 12
Friday, February 23

726
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,648
Dad called Megan after
the charges were dropped.

727
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:33,047
He said he wanted to see her,
to be a family again.

728
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:37,544
She wanted to put an end to it,
but she was scared.

729
00:36:37,544 --> 00:36:40,359
Is that why she asked
you to come along?

730
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:42,271
Yes.

731
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:45,449
Where did you go?

732
00:36:51,415 --> 00:36:53,199
Jody?

733
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:56,925
We drove to my dad's office building.

734
00:36:56,925 --> 00:37:00,048
What happened
when you got there?

735
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:03,941
Megan got out of the car
and went inside.

736
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:06,331
Where were you?

737
00:37:09,549 --> 00:37:14,595
I know this is really hard for you,
but I need you to answer the question.

738
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:23,339
She didn't do it.

739
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:25,226
Jody...

740
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:27,005
It was me.

741
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:29,850
I didn't mean for it to happen.

742
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,697
The gun just went off.

743
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:38,542
I didn't mean to kill him.

744
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:43,214
I'm sorry.

745
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:49,603
I'm sorry.

746
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:52,009
Prosecuting 101, Counselor.

747
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:55,317
Don't rely on potential defendants
to make your case to the grand jury.

748
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:57,087
Jody wasn't a defendant,
she was a witness,

749
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:59,392
and without her testimony
we couldn't put Megan at the crime scene.

750
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:02,015
Oh, it never occurred to you
she might confess to protect her sister?

751
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:03,496
We questioned her
a number of times.

752
00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:04,903
Her story never changed.

753
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:08,097
Until you gave her immunity,
in exchange for her testimony.

754
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:10,347
Her immunity doesn't extend
to cover perjury.

755
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:12,670
Perjury? What if she's telling the truth?

756
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,338
You just freed a 15-year-old killer.

757
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:17,999
We had every reason to believe
that Megan Ramsey killed her father.

758
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,537
I'm still not convinced she didn't.

759
00:38:19,537 --> 00:38:21,865
You're gonna have a hard time
convincing a jury

760
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:25,315
if your star witness says she's the one
who pulled the trigger.

761
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:27,027
I'm on my honeymoon here, Ms. Cabot,

762
00:38:27,027 --> 00:38:30,783
so I can still blame my predecessor
for all the screw-ups in this division.

763
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,812
Unfortunately, I told the D.A.

764
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,870
I supported your strategy.

765
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,509
So do us both a favor, huh?

766
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,863
Fix this mess.

767
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:51,239
I'm sure your lawyer already
told you you have immunity.

768
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:55,629
That means I cannot prosecute you
for anything you say to me now,

769
00:38:55,629 --> 00:38:57,450
unless you lie to me.

770
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:00,248
Then all bets are off,
you understand?

771
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:02,312
Okay.

772
00:39:02,312 --> 00:39:04,508
Now...

773
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:09,497
Just tell me the truth.
What happened?

774
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:14,101
Megan was too afraid
to go in alone.

775
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:19,441
By the time we got to his office door,
she was shaking.

776
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,869
When he got up from his desk,
she started screaming.

777
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,404
He grabbed her
and he shook her

778
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,041
and he told her to be quiet.

779
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:32,105
She dropped her purse

780
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,834
and I saw the gun.

781
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:38,982
I picked it up

782
00:39:38,982 --> 00:39:43,057
and I told him to let her go,
but he wouldn't listen.

783
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:46,903
He just kept yelling and yelling,

784
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:49,667
and I hollered, "Stop!"

785
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:54,563
He just stared at me.

786
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,744
Then he reached for the gun.

787
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:03,292
It just went off.

788
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:07,990
He looked so surprised.

789
00:40:11,854 --> 00:40:14,369
It was an accident.

790
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:17,447
I loved my daddy.

791
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:24,427
I just wanted him
to stop hurting Megan.

792
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:34,478
How do I make sense of this?

793
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:38,065
My husband is dead,

794
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:41,540
killed by my own child's hand

795
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,079
and my willingness to believe 
he was a monster.

796
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:51,497
How awful it must have been 
for my husband

797
00:40:51,497 --> 00:40:56,908
to know that the people 
he loved most had turned on him.

798
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,512
We all share that burden, 
Mrs. Ramsey.

799
00:41:04,307 --> 00:41:07,358
Jody will not be prosecuted.

800
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:12,234
Not by the courts, 
only by her own conscience.

801
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:16,012
But what about that woman 
who treated my daughter with lies?

802
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:19,352
How many more families 
will she destroy?

803
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:23,435
Megan went to her seeking help.

804
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:30,741
The patient has exhibited signs
of acute and...

805
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,420
Dr. Wharton.

806
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:34,800
I'm in the middle of something.

807
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,402
If you'd like to make an appointment...

808
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:37,906
Not today.

809
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:38,841
What is this?

810
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,222
A subpoena for the medical records

811
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:44,168
pertaining to the treatment of 
Megan, Jody and Lily Ramsey.

812
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,481
Those records are confidential!

813
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:48,239
We'll take extra special care of them.

814
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,971
You'll also find a warrant 
for your arrest.

815
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:52,030
On what charge?

816
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,221
Reckless endangerment 
in the death of Evan Ramsey.

817
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:56,561
That's outrageous. Meg...

818
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:58,872
Megan is a very sick woman.

819
00:41:58,872 --> 00:42:01,493
That you made even sicker 
with your sodium amytal sessions.

820
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:03,723
Oh, you're hardly qualified 
to pass judgment.

821
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:05,704
Maybe not, but Megan's 
new therapist is,

822
00:42:05,704 --> 00:42:09,020
and he's willing to testify that 
your sessions amounted to malpractice.

823
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,997
Based on what?

824
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:12,269
Megan recanted her accusations.

825
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:14,495
He said that you 
manipulated her memory.

826
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:17,512
Why, the family is in denial.

827
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:20,299
They're just looking for a scapegoat.

828
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:21,793
They're looking for justice.

829
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:23,713
The Ramseys filed suit this morning.

830
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:27,797
The State Board has suspended 
your license pending a full investigation.

831
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:31,467
All around, I'd say this is a day 
that you'll never forget.

832
00:42:34,005 --> 00:42:38,096
