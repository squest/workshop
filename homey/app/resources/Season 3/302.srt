1
00:00:00,347 --> 00:00:00,150
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,819
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

3
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,077
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:08,744
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:11,646
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:13,670
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:19,918
Subject 22512-M.

8
00:00:19,918 --> 00:00:21,895
Hemolysis at the time of death.

9
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:24,316
Lawrence, you make a case
for pink teeth,

10
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,666
you're asking for trouble.

11
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,508
As my students say,
"Bring it on."

12
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:31,105
Subject 22512-F.

13
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:33,663
Tissue breakdown
consistent with exposure.

14
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:35,477
Scavengers aren't eating, though.

15
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:38,613
What do you expect?
The place is a smorgasbord.

16
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:43,966
Who put them on the trail?

17
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:52,750
- These don't belong to us.
- Call the police.

18
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,256
You're contaminating our experiments.

19
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:03,115
Hey, be careful.
Sorry.

20
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:05,575
- Are you the SAC?
- You from Special Victims?

21
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:06,962
Detective Stabler.

22
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:08,643
Special Agent in Charge,
Rod Franklin.

23
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:11,868
This is Doctor Talbot.
He runs this facility.

24
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:14,505
It's a hell of a place
you got here, Doc.

25
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:16,128
Decay research, Detective.

26
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:18,529
We study death to help
law enforcement.

27
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:22,023
Rates of decomp,
cadaver-insect symbiosis,

28
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:25,006
geology, cadaverine
and putrescine compounds...

30
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:29,973
Thank you.

31
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,500
How'd they get in here?

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,767
We got drag marks inside
and out of the compound.

33
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:39,544
The unsub parked
on the back country road.

34
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:40,750
Anyone work here at night?

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,097
Strictly a day job, except
for occasional experiments in the lab.

36
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:46,483
There security cameras?

37
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:49,454
Only people trying to break in here
are drunken frat boys

38
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:52,370
and brave Halloween pranksters.

39
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:53,893
Have you been briefed on the victims?

40
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:56,220
The two adult IDs were intact.

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,327
The Hispanic female
was one of our unit's rape victims.

42
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,601
Detective Benson was the primary.

43
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,586
The minor we're still checking on.

44
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:06,392
The white male was the father
of a rape-murder victim.

45
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,050
Also my partner's case.

46
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,368
Since you're senior in your department,
you'll act as liaison.

47
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:14,222
I'll also need you to coordinate your
primary detectives of record

48
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:17,209
for a briefing at 1700 hours.

00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,107
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/10/05

62
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,698
Elliot, all three victims were my cases.

63
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,285
Why wasn't I called to the body farm?

64
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:23,081
Because I'm the Feds' VICAP partner
and there just wasn't enough time.

65
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,426
Look, the bodies were dumped
at a federal facility,

66
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:27,341
but Huang thinks that
they were killed in the city,

67
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,598
so it's our case.

68
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,868
No. No, it's not our case.
This is my case.

69
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:33,321
I'm the lead detective on this one.

70
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,369
Okay.

71
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:39,058
Let's get started.

72
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:42,634
These are our three victims.

73
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,823
Our first victim was Peter Cordell.

74
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:47,734
I met Peter in 1993 when his daughter,

75
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:50,393
Tina Cordell, was raped and murdered.

76
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:53,636
I kept him updated on the case,
I drove him to court every day

77
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:58,391
and I held his hand when our perp,
Victor Klaussen, was acquitted.

78
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,777
What went wrong with the case?

79
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:02,728
A series of lab mix-ups
contaminated the evidence.

80
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:05,506
Pioneer days of DNA. There was
nothing you could do about it.

81
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,886
What's the background
on the Hispanic female?

82
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:10,961
Victim Number 2
is Carmela Barrantes.

83
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,868
She was raped and beaten
three years ago by a gang-banger

84
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:15,933
who's now serving 8-to-12
in Sing Sing.

85
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,089
I guess we can cross him off
our suspect list.

86
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,116
Why? This might be a revenge killing
by the gang-banger's crew.

87
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:23,827
But there's no gang affiliation between
the other two victims.

88
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:26,116
Are we sure about that?
What about the 10-year-old?

89
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,495
Gangs are recruiting younger
and younger these days.

90
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:30,760
Victim Number 3
is Clayton Derricks,

91
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,989
who was physically abused
by his father, Bruce Derricks.

92
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:36,206
When Clayton was placed
in a group home,

93
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:39,644
he was sodomized by an older boy
and then he was placed in foster care,

94
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:42,885
and I cannot tell you what it took
to get this boy to trust me.

95
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:45,792
A missing persons report was filed
yesterday by the foster mother.

96
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:47,378
Do we know cause of death?

97
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,319
Preliminary tox reports just came in.

98
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,369
All three victims were pumped full of
sedatives and potassium chloride.

99
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:54,027
ME says death was painless.

100
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,530
Like that makes a difference.

101
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,716
Interview the families.

102
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,867
Let's find a connection
other than Benson.

103
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,936
Home of Adam Cordell
424 West 38th Street
Tuesday, February 27

104
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:10,372
By any chance, did your father know
a Carmela Barrantes

105
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:14,257
or a young boy
named Clayton Derricks?

106
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:17,999
Dad met a lot of people
while he kept Klaussen in his sights,

107
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,798
but he never mentioned them to me.

108
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:24,280
When Tina died, I didn't think
it could get any worse.

109
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,753
Watching her killer in the courtroom,

110
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:29,849
seeing him smile when
they declared him not guilty.

111
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,182
Mr. Cordell,
the lab made mistakes.

112
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:36,328
That bastard's walking free.
He killed my sister.

113
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:39,778
He probably killed my dad.
He's just gonna get away with that, too?

114
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,515
Have you seen
Victor Klaussen in the area?

115
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,518
Has he threatened you?

116
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,308
You know what that murdering scum
is doing right now?

117
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:46,995
He's laying carpet in Queens.

118
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:48,967
Yeah, his brother-in-law
got him the job.

119
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:52,224
He's married now.
His wife is pregnant.

120
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:53,705
Have you been stalking him?

121
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,887
No, my father used to follow him.

122
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,463
Always wanted to know
where he was

123
00:05:57,463 --> 00:06:01,174
so he could tell everybody
what he was.

124
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,918
And that got him killed.

125
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,330
Hey, Victor. How you doing?

126
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,204
I'm working.

127
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:11,701
Well, you need to account for your
movements for the last couple of days.

128
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:12,758
I don't have to talk to you.

129
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:14,693
A jury found me not guilty, remember?

130
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:15,832
Okay. We'll talk to his wife.

131
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,083
I'm sure she'll tell us
what we need to know.

132
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,756
Why can't you just leave me alone?

133
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:20,519
Like you left Tina Cordell alone?

134
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,154
You raped her,
then you strangled her.

135
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:24,899
You know, you can't harass me.
Not you and not her old man.

136
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,929
- Her old man is dead, Victor.
- Good.

137
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,931
I can get on with my life now.
Why don't you?

138
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,355
Oh, we'd like to,
except he was murdered.

139
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:32,240
That makes you
prime suspect number one.

140
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,013
You know, you can't
pin that on me, all right?

141
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:36,312
The guy was unhinged.
I even had to get a restraining order,

142
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,774
but you cops,
you never enforced it.

143
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:40,709
Well, that's 'cause we figured a murdering
rapist like you can handle yourself.

144
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,480
You know, Tina had
a smart mouth, too.

145
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,047
It got her in a lot of trouble.

146
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:45,580
- That sounded like a threat.
- Yeah, it did.

147
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,133
Maybe we should arrest him.
Ruin his day.

148
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,761
Arrest me for what?

149
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,743
How about an obstruction, resisting?

150
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,451
It's a long way to the station house.

151
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,193
I'll think of a thousand reasons
by the time we get there.

152
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:55,559
We'll let you stew
in the can for a few days,

153
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,670
maybe even leak
that you're a pedophile.

154
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,722
I bet after your arraignment,
you'll tell us anything we want to know.

155
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:02,481
Okay. Two nights ago, 
I was home.

156
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,014
Last night my wife and I
were at Lamaze class.

157
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:07,017
She has the number.

158
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:08,709
We're done.

159
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,360
Now we're done.

160
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,660
Mrs. Harding's Foster Home
450 East 106th Street
Tuesday, February 27

161
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,785
At any given time,
I've got six kids living here.

162
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:25,628
It's temporary until they can
be placed in a home.

163
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:29,317
Clayton was with me three months,
but he never warmed to me.

164
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:31,862
I guess he didn't
want to get attached.

165
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:33,630
He run away a lot?

166
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,098
It's not unusual.

167
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,589
Clayton was pretty stable considering.

168
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:41,420
The younger kids looked up to him.

169
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:43,578
Did he run home to his father?

170
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:46,275
No. He hasn't
seen his dad in a while.

171
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,343
Visits were always supervised.

172
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,564
Usually by Detective Benson.

173
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:54,200
When he did run, we could
always find Clayton in the Bronx.

174
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,676
That was his old stomping ground?

175
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,828
That's where the group home is.

176
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:00,071
He has a close friend
who still lives there.

177
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:02,847
I contacted them
before I called the police,

178
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,861
but the boy said he hadn't seen him.

179
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,354
What's his name?

180
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:08,208
Michael Washington.

181
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:11,357
Michael and Clayton first bonded
over abusive fathers.

182
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,448
Then Michael tried to fight
Clayton's attacker

183
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:15,254
and got his arm broken
for his troubles.

184
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:17,049
After that they were inseparable.

185
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:18,280
What happened to the rapist?

186
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,842
He's now housed in the city's
finest juvenile facility,

187
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:23,011
where I'm sure he's honing
his criminal skills.

188
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,173
Some reason why you didn't
keep Clayton here with his friend?

189
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,387
His counselor thought it was
best to move him to foster care

190
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,434
and I disagreed,
but I don't have a Ph.D.

191
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:33,173
Clayton's foster mother said she
called here after his disappearance.

192
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:34,354
Yeah. I questioned the boy.

193
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,541
He assured me he hadn't
seen Clayton in a while.

194
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,832
- You believe him?
- No.

195
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:41,207
He probably thought his friend
was in trouble, so he covered for him.

196
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,641
Michael, how you doing?

197
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:49,020
These detectives need
to talk to you about Clayton

198
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,678
and they would appreciate
your honesty.

199
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:54,049
You need me to stay?

200
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:58,625
No. / All right.
I'll be right outside.

201
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,840
Badges?

202
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,462
What do you want to know?

203
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,657
Did you see Clayton yesterday?

204
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:09,719
Yeah.

205
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,939
- Where'd you meet him?
- Down the block.

206
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,213
He was all excited.

207
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:15,245
Got some letter saying
he won a computer.

208
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:18,148
Knew it was a scam.
Nobody gets something for nothing.

209
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:19,819
You know where he went
to pick it up?

210
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:22,196
No. You had to bring
the letter with you.

211
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,596
Begged me for cab money.

212
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,158
Said if he got on the subway,
he'd get jacked.

213
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,460
How much money did you give him?

214
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,163
All I had. $22.15.

215
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:31,652
Where'd Clayton catch the cab?

216
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:34,012
We called one from
the McDonald's parking lot.

217
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,700
You remember the name
of the cab company?

218
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,571
Got it from the book.
Starling Car Service.

219
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,632
Thanks.

220
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,745
Barrantes Residence
800 Amsterdam Avenue
Tuesday, February 27

221
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:47,449
She didn't go out alone after the rape.

222
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:50,199
She lost touch with her friends.

223
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,384
Any boyfriends?

224
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,919
The last one was abusive.

225
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,717
Carmela finally got rid of him
after going to a counselor.

226
00:09:57,717 --> 00:10:02,027
She was getting stronger,
going back to school.

227
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:05,099
She even won a computer.

228
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:10,751
Won a computer, like through
a contest or a raffle?

229
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:13,596
No. I saw the letter.

230
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:17,208
It looked like
one of those sales deals.

231
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,446
- Is it important?
- Well, it might be.

232
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,511
Do you still have that letter?

233
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,601
She took it with her.

234
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:27,590
- I'm sorry I can't help you more.
- It's okay.

235
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,680
We're gonna find out who did this.

236
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:38,144
I want to thank you for helping
my daughter, Detective Benson.

237
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:42,163
I will always be grateful for that.

238
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:47,157
Hey, Cap, so far it doesn't
look like the victims knew each other.

239
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:49,589
Well, what about the boy's father?
Have we located him yet?

240
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,963
Moved from his last known address.
We're still looking.

241
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,348
We checked with the Cordells.

242
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:56,309
Turns out the father got a letter
saying he won a desktop computer,

243
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:58,017
just like the kid.

244
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:00,135
Mrs. Barrantes said that
Carmela got the same letter.

245
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:01,771
Three for three,

246
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:04,589
but no letters were found
at the scene or on the bodies.

247
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,589
Got a hit from Starling Car Service.

248
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,014
Dispatch states that a kid matching
Clayton's description

249
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:11,638
was dropped off
at this address in Chelsea.

250
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,963
We're gonna need
a search warrant.

251
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,220
I'll take care of it.
Get moving.

252
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,986
I never met the guy.
We did everything over the phone.

253
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,101
What was the name on the lease?

254
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:20,590
Vilia Sonoben.
From out of town.

255
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,637
He was looking for space
to set up shop here.

256
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:25,446
He had a local bank account.
He paid six months in advance.

257
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:26,937
And how'd he get the key?

258
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,213
He phoned ahead, told me to leave
the key above the door.

259
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:32,303
The place was empty.
There was nothing to steal.

260
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:35,848
Your tenant give you any idea
what he did for a living?

261
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:37,595
He designs promotional literature.

262
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,039
You know, those little brochures
you get in the mail.

263
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,955
You got a phone number
in case of emergency?

264
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:44,569
After you phoned, I tried to reach him,
but the number's disconnected.

265
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,143
What's this guy done?

266
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:53,784
"Congratulations, you are the lucky winner
of a new Sonic Vox desktop computer."

267
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:57,969
Well, they all had to bring the letters
and sit down with our suspect.

268
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:00,469
Have a drink, it's laced with,
I don't know, Valium

269
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,855
and then it's lights out.

270
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,264
We've got our crime scene.

271
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,623
Crime scene? In my building?

272
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:08,585
I am not responsible for what
my tenants do in their offices.

273
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:11,925
I mean, how do I know what kind of
people I'm renting space to?

274
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,833
Guys.

275
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,340
Three victims,

276
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,432
different race, different gender,
different age.

277
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:34,921
This is about revenge.
The real target is Detective Benson.

278
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,176
It's personal.

279
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:39,026
You've enraged someone so much
they want you twisting.

280
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,767
Why the body farm?

281
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:44,267
Why transport three victims
90 miles outside the city?

282
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,923
He wanted them found and studied.

283
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:48,429
He dumped them at a research facility
that's federally funded.

284
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,314
Guaranteeing national attention.

285
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:52,532
But how did the suspect find them?

286
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:53,840
How did he get into my files?

287
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,890
How did he even know
that they're my case?

288
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,062
Tina Cordell case had a lot of national
press coverage, right?

289
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:00,455
High-school kid raped,

290
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,222
strangled with her purse strap
by her boyfriend, Victor Klaussen.

291
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:06,036
Latching onto a news story doesn't
explain the other two victims though.

292
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,735
The foster mother said
that you supervised meetings

293
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:10,208
between Clayton and his father.
Why?

294
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,164
Because the man is a drunk.

295
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:14,099
I thought if I stuck around
that he'd get some help.

296
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:15,090
I know what it's like
to live through that.

297
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,829
You maintained a personal relationship
with Carmela Barrantes.

298
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,034
Well, she needed help.

299
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:21,486
My day doesn't end when we catch
a perp or get a conviction.

300
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:22,856
No one's blaming you, Detective.

301
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:25,181
Well, you think that
I led him to these people,

302
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,654
that I have a stalker?

303
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:28,885
If that's how he chose them,
he wasn't stalking you.

304
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:31,904
There was no sexual fixation.
It was reconnaissance.

305
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,298
Well, let's look into my files
and see who has a grudge.

306
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:37,679
Potassium chloride is an ingredient
in a death-row cocktail.

307
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,564
Sounds to me like ex-con contempt.

308
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:44,205
Using police restraints to pose the bodies
is a significant indicator.

309
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:46,781
Check the computer
for recent prison releases.

310
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,913
We're looking for an ex-con
who has a serious hatred for Olivia.

311
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,320
Let's start with the ones
who were vocal about it.

312
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,656
First, you two,
follow the money.

313
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,660
Here it is. The account was opened
four months ago.

314
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,678
Hasn't been any activity in 30 days.

315
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:03,197
We'd like you to put
a freeze on the account.

316
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:04,931
I'm going to need something
with a judge's signature.

317
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:05,732
That's en route,

318
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:07,848
but in the meantime we'd like you
to pull all the canceled checks

319
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,357
- so we can test for fingerprints.
- All we have are photocopies.

320
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:12,300
We return the originals
to the account holder.

321
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,199
You got a balance here?

322
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,279
$1,300 and change.

323
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,626
All right.
If there's any activity,

324
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,769
I want you to hold the check.

325
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,501
Call the FBI task force
and they'll process everything, okay?

326
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:26,745
I'll add an addendum to the file
that the check shouldn't be handled.

327
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,603
- Thank you.
- Sure.

328
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,065
Those checks should go to our lab.

329
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:34,092
I don't want the Feds
processing our evidence,

330
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:36,269
doling out information
whenever they feel like it.

331
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,389
Well, their lab is
better equipped, it's faster.

332
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:39,812
If there are any problems
then it's on them.

333
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,436
Wasn't your name stenciled
on that door,

334
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:43,107
so whose ass are you really covering?

335
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:44,361
Okay. The way I see it,

336
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:46,507
the only us and them
is cops and criminals.

337
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:47,941
- We are on the same team.
- Yeah.

338
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:50,870
We are till the press shows up.
Benson.

339
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:53,601
We're on our way.

340
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,764
Got Clayton's father.

341
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:57,464
He's in the Tombs
on a drunk and disorderly.

342
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,054
Clayton is dead, Mr. Derricks.

343
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:02,144
No, he can't be.

344
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:07,120
Well, someone killed your son and
dumped his body outside of Poughkeepsie.

345
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:10,651
What's my boy doing way out there?

346
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:13,120
When was the last time
you had contact with Clayton?

347
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,214
They wouldn't let me talk to him.
Said I couldn't see him.

348
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:18,384
It was your fault.
You said I wasn't a good father.

349
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,970
Has anybody tried to talk
to you about your son?

350
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,714
Anyone at all?
Strangers, social workers?

351
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,510
He told you I didn't hit him.

352
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,542
He told you that
he fell off his bike.

353
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,200
Clayton didn't have a bike, Mr. Derricks.
He barely had enough to eat.

354
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,133
Oh, I remember.

355
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:35,070
What do you remember?

356
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,200
Clayton was raped
in that group home.

357
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,617
You took him from me.

358
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,236
Said he'd be better off.

359
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,955
Guard!

360
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,045
- I'm fine.
- I'm not.

361
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:53,243
Some low-life's out to get you.

362
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,223
If he wanted to take me out,
he would've tried it already.

363
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:57,576
So now you can read minds and you
got eyes in the back of your head.

364
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:59,138
Stabler.

365
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,545
Yeah.

366
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:03,446
How many?

367
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:08,147
That's not a problem.
We'll just split it up.

368
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:10,515
Yeah.

369
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:12,886
Got it.

370
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:15,410
Three ex-cons you sent up
were loud about getting even.

371
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,238
Cragen thinks all three might have
the resources to pull this off.

372
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,418
West 125th Street & Broadway
Wednesday, February 28

373
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:27,441
Oh, I remember Detective Benson.
How are you?

374
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,639
I'm curious about some of
your activities, Junior.

375
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,303
Sorry. Gave up my life
of crime long ago.

376
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:33,473
What's your beef?

377
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:35,449
Well, you were pretty vocal
about getting even

378
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,751
when I collared you
for car-jacking and rape.

379
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,105
I was hopped up on crack.

380
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:42,140
I don't blame you for anything, Detective.
At least, not anymore.

381
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,566
You used to run these streets.
Your crew still run drugs up to Canada?

382
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:47,703
All my friends are 
either dead or in jail,

383
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,488
so why the trip down memory lane?

384
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:50,890
Because we're out of time.

385
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,492
We need some answers, Junior.

386
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,878
Someone's got my partner
in their sights.

387
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:57,521
They must not be very good
since she's still breathing.

388
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:59,170
You were never very subtle,
were you?

389
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,956
Saved the finesse for business,
not petty beefs.

390
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:04,648
And like I said, I'm over that.

391
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,825
So you just sit in that chair
and watch the world go by. That it?

392
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:10,909
I spend my days
on these streets with the kids.

393
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,902
Hope they'll see this chair
and wake up.

394
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:14,338
That's what my life's about.

395
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,583
Give us some names
and we're done.

396
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,975
Uniforms will vouch
for my work with gangs.

397
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:23,505
Reverend Johnson at Faithful Central
will give you a list of my caretakers.

398
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:28,143
Hope you find your man.

399
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:33,037
- I didn't do it.
- Do what?

400
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:35,728
I've just been sitting here
making a living, all right?

401
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:37,504
I wasn't there.
I didn't do it.

402
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,255
You remember Detective Benson?

403
00:17:40,255 --> 00:17:42,194
Bitch was at my parole hearing.

404
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,755
Is she dead?

405
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,493
I let them take away my manhood

406
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:51,570
so I can get out and she shows up
and throws a monkey wrench.

407
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,529
That wasn't right.

408
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,951
Wasn't right raping
your six-year-old niece.

409
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,610
Getting out early,
definitely wasn't right.

410
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,395
I take the shots.

411
00:17:58,395 --> 00:18:01,336
You know, they make me fat and sick.

412
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:04,387
Look at me.
I got my own rack now.

413
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:05,930
You think I like looking like this?

414
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,735
Ponytails and barrettes
still get you hot, fat boy?

415
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:11,282
No. Sir.

416
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,055
Haven't been anywhere near a kid.

417
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:15,724
That's a stupid lie!
They can come here to you!

418
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:17,799
I got no more sex drive.

419
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,607
Look, I'm clean. I swear.

420
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:22,346
What's it gonna take
for you guys to believe me?

421
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:24,805
A special kind of surgery.

422
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:32,388
Heaven Scent Flowers
490 Broome Street
Wednesday, February 28

423
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,494
What the hell do you want?

424
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:36,842
- We'd like to talk to your husband.
- We're divorced.

425
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:39,380
- You keep in contact?
- You've got to be kidding me.

426
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,358
Mrs. Plummer,
somebody's killing people.

427
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:44,720
Somebody with a grudge
against me.

428
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,942
Now, under the circumstances,
your ex-husband qualifies.

429
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:51,171
You put an innocent man in prison.

430
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,765
He served seven years
for attempted murder and rape.

431
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,682
Crimes he didn't commit.

432
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:56,982
Leave Eric alone.

433
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:59,247
Eyewitness testimony 
put him in prison.

434
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:01,328
Now we know DNA evidence
cleared him.

435
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:03,544
It just wasn't
available at the time.

436
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,216
And that makes everything all right?

437
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:07,864
Do you know where he is?

438
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,642
Mrs. Plummer, we can
charge you with obstruction

439
00:19:09,642 --> 00:19:11,051
and we don't want to do that.

440
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:14,600
I don't know where he is.
But if I did, I still wouldn't tell you.

441
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:22,515
We'll dump her phones.

442
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:25,099
She might give her ex a heads-up
that we're looking.

443
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,335
Tomorrow? I'm tired.

444
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:29,260
Feel like some dinner?

445
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:31,412
When was the last time
your kids saw your ugly mug?

446
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:32,896
Oh, we'll set an extra place.
Come on.

447
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:34,514
No. No thanks.

448
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:36,864
I'll see you later, okay?

449
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,104
Who is it?

450
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,218
Who's down there?

451
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,862
You've got the wrong apartment.

452
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:49,967
Hotshot like the others?

453
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:52,509
Bastard dumped him
at my feet, like some gift.

454
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,717
Clayton Derricks' father.

455
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:56,913
The canvass of your neighbors
is drawing a blank.

456
00:21:56,913 --> 00:21:59,288
Did you notice any strangers
in the area, Detective Benson?

457
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:00,927
Anyone who stood out?

458
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:03,089
Is there some reason
that you think that if I had

459
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,104
that I would withhold
the information?

460
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:07,976
Sorry, but as much training
as we get in being observant,

461
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:10,955
when it comes to our personal
safety and well-being,

462
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,049
we're not as diligent.

463
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:13,582
My partner knows how to do her job.

464
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,141
Look, I'm sure Detective
Benson is capable,

465
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:18,554
but she's going to have to stand down.

466
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,263
No.

467
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:23,133
This man was alive until you went
to the Tombs and questioned him.

468
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,898
A little early to be
pointing fingers, isn't it?

469
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:27,381
I'm not trying to blame her,
but she can't work this case anymore.

470
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:29,490
Look, you're wasting your breath.
First of all, I don't work for you.

471
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,553
Second of all,
these victims are my cases.

472
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:33,413
The perp is stalking you,

473
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:35,031
which is why you need
a protective detail.

474
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:36,568
No, forget about it.
I'm not a victim.

475
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,074
Olivia, might not be a bad idea.

476
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:39,695
We're wasting time here.

477
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:42,818
Does anybody know how Derricks
got bailed out of the Tombs?

478
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:46,538
According to the release form,
it was you.

479
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,157
Lonnie's Bail Bonds
50 East 116th Street
Thursday, March 1

480
00:22:51,157 --> 00:22:53,971
Excuse me. We need to see
the paperwork on Bruce Derricks.

481
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,954
- Lonnie!
- What?

482
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:58,339
Who put up the paperwork
on Bruce Derricks?

483
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,995
What for? He's not a skip.

484
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,812
The prisoner's dead.

485
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:09,232
Says here a Mr. Oliver Benson
laid down a G.

486
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:12,259
Sent it over to the clerk,
like I always do.

487
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,737
Where's the ID?

488
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:14,773
The guy paid cash.

489
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:18,198
I don't need ID unless real property
is used for collateral.

490
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,995
Can you give us a description?

491
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:21,346
Do you know how many people
come through here

492
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:22,591
looking to bail out some low-life?

493
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:24,923
We want the guy
on federal and capital crimes,

494
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:27,176
so I suggest
that you try to remember.

495
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:28,914
I'd hate to see all the dots
connect back to you.

496
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:31,388
Sweetheart, I can't help you.

497
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:32,883
Sweetheart?

498
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,709
- Everybody. Out. Now.
- Out.

499
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,044
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Out.

500
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:38,518
You can't do that!
What are you doing? Wait a minute!

501
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:39,911
You're supposed to get
a copy of the ID.

502
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:41,503
You're supposed to know
who's posting bail.

503
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,290
You're supposed to keep
complete records,

504
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,401
so the courts know
where the money's coming from.

505
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:47,187
It wasn't drug money.

506
00:23:47,187 --> 00:23:49,261
Most people can raise a grand.

507
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,594
Sir.

508
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:51,856
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

509
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:55,333
The guy was white. Average.
I don't know, late 20s, early 30s.

510
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,064
What can I tell you?

511
00:23:57,064 --> 00:24:00,830
Shirl, do you remember
hair or eye color?

512
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:05,095
I'm sorry. I got nothing.

513
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,741
Is this an official visit
or is it off the record?

514
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,833
Both.

515
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:23,915
You need to put
Detective Benson on a desk.

516
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:24,949
No.

517
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:27,268
- She's a liability.
- She's one of my best detectives.

518
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:29,379
I don't doubt it.

519
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,286
The bodies were dumped at a facility
funded by federal dollars.

520
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:35,158
If I take the case from you,
I have to put it in writing.

521
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,439
My complaints end up
a black mark on your file.

522
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:41,220
I don't want to do that, Captain.

523
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:46,479
We all have choices to make.
I've already made mine.

524
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:05,611
Any hits to suggest Mrs. Plummer
called her ex-husband?

525
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:07,485
Still looking.
Flowers.

526
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:10,161
Seems like a big waste of money for
something that dies in a few days.

527
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,366
No wonder you're divorced.
I send them all the time.

528
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:13,847
Only 'cause you have to.

529
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:14,669
I got something.

530
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:20,556
It was a 45-minute call right after we left
to a Baseline Labs in Midtown.

531
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:21,952
If Plummer works at the lab,

532
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:24,848
that means he'd have access
to potassium chloride.

533
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:26,995
And Pavulon.
ME's report came in.

534
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:29,395
Unlike the other three,
Bruce Derricks suffered.

535
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,957
Paralyzes the muscles so they can
intubate for general anesthesia.

536
00:25:32,957 --> 00:25:35,136
Derricks suffocated,
awake and aware.

537
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:37,300
Took about two minutes to die.

538
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,292
He saw him as a perp
and he executed him like one.

539
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:41,667
Check the employees.

540
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,297
If Mr. Plummer works there,
make sure you give him a lot of room.

541
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:45,259
I don't want to jam him up.

542
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:47,090
I just want to know where he's been
and what he's been doing.

543
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,012
Just take it easy.
You're wound a little tight.

544
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,582
You worried about something?

545
00:25:53,582 --> 00:25:55,298
Your safety.

546
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:56,630
No protective detail.

547
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,491
Trust me, I'm not trying to be a hero.

548
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,604
Just that a protective detail is exactly
what this guy expects.

549
00:26:01,604 --> 00:26:04,496
And what happens if this hump
comes after you next?

550
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,813
He wants me twisting,
not dead.

551
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:08,101
He wants me thinking about him.

552
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,597
- Obsessing as much as he is.
- You can't be sure of that.

553
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:13,365
Yes, I can, 'cause it's working.

554
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:17,205
Baseline Labs
98 West 54th Street
Thursday, March 1

555
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:19,654
No, I don't have an Eric Plummer
working for us.

556
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:22,325
How about this guy?
He look familiar to you?

557
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:24,835
Well, this looks like Norman.

558
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:27,762
- Your guy's thinner, though.
- Norman what?

559
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:30,023
Webber. He works
for insurance services.

560
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,871
He calls on our clients at their homes.

561
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:35,832
He gets blood and
urine samples for physicals.

562
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:36,865
This can't be the guy.

563
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:38,800
We're gonna need
his personnel file.

564
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,991
We have a rigorous screening process,
extensive background checks.

565
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,002
Norman passed with flying colors.

566
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,989
And where is he now?

567
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:48,950
He's got the Upper
West Side today.

568
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,876
You know, if anything happens
and we're liable for hiring an ex-con,

569
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,437
we could lose our contracts
with the insurance companies.

570
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:55,516
We could lose our bond.

571
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:58,727
Mr. Platt, Norman Webber is not
an ex-con, he's not a suspect.

572
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:00,001
But this photo's of...

573
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,893
Have him call us
as soon as possible.

574
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:03,256
Thank you.

575
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:05,461
Yes. Yes.

576
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:11,623
Hey, I was just trying to
get in our man's head.

577
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,837
He hates me so he kills people
that I tried to help.

578
00:27:14,837 --> 00:27:16,873
How does that make you feel?

579
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,152
How would you feel?

580
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:20,553
Relax, I'm not trying to shrink you.

581
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:23,099
Yes, you are.
Every statement's interpretive.

582
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,527
Trying to make something out of nothing.

583
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:25,517
It's my job.

584
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:27,691
I used to interview some of the most
dangerous psychopaths.

585
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:28,878
It's all I did.

586
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:31,442
Profiling serial killers,
it sounds like a lot of fun.

587
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,112
It's why I joined the FBI.

588
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:35,857
They had access to all the disorders
that I wanted to study.

589
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:38,186
Until I got complacent.

590
00:27:38,186 --> 00:27:40,373
Were you attacked?

591
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:42,836
I was interviewing a psychopath
and I missed him calculate

592
00:27:42,836 --> 00:27:46,318
how much time there was to kill me
before the guards hit the door.

593
00:27:46,318 --> 00:27:47,868
It was a...

594
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,353
It was a close call.

595
00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:50,746
He got into your head.

596
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:52,475
The way this perp is in yours.

597
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:54,089
Instead of attacking you directly,

598
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,945
he's hurting the people around you.

599
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:58,455
It's psychological warfare.

600
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:02,080
He's been planning this for a while.

601
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,354
He posed the bodies
comforting each other.

602
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:06,645
Potassium chloride
is a painless death.

603
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:08,151
He's freeing them.

604
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:09,390
From what?

605
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,889
From the miserable existence
that you left them in.

606
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:17,190
He felt like they were suffering
and so he euthanized them.

607
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,139
He identifies with them.

608
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:23,991
He sees himself as your victim, too.

609
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:27,578
Mr. Plummer,
thank you for coming in.

610
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:29,404
Right this way.

611
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:33,533
My client's been railroaded
by the police before.

612
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,925
He's here under duress.
Is he a suspect?

613
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:38,742
That's premature.
This is an ongoing investigation.

614
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:41,334
As soon as we can clear him, Mr. Plummer
can put this behind him.

615
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:44,460
Well, you'll understand if we insist on
Detective Benson's absence.

616
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,240
The request is unnecessary.
I'm taking off.

617
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:49,915
Let's get out of here.

618
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:52,412
Chauncey's. Fin's treat.

619
00:28:55,713 --> 00:28:59,163
My client was wrongfully convicted
of rape and attempted murder.

620
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:01,053
He spent seven years upstate.

621
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:04,137
What makes you think he wants
more trouble than he's already had?

622
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:07,857
Well, maybe he had plenty of time
in his cell to plan his revenge.

623
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:09,086
Well, charge him and he'll answer,

624
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:11,916
otherwise leave the man alone.

625
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,704
Why not cooperate with us?

626
00:29:13,704 --> 00:29:15,347
Well, the last time he did,
he went to prison.

627
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:17,803
Sent there by an overzealous detective.

628
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,161
Your client did receive a fair trial.

629
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:21,638
He was convicted by a jury.

630
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:25,010
He wasn't personally singled out
for persecution by Detective Benson.

631
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,329
You ever spent time in prison?

632
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:28,841
Have you even been arrested?

633
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:32,510
Cuffed, printed, photographed?

634
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:37,027
I was beaten,
raped and tortured.

635
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:41,499
I finally learned to stop screaming,
that only made it worse.

636
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:46,331
Please don't dismiss what I went
through by telling me I got a fair trial.

637
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,287
Why'd you change your name?

638
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,277
I wanted a fresh start.

639
00:29:50,277 --> 00:29:53,632
I finally felt safe again
and the cops show up at my job.

640
00:29:53,632 --> 00:29:56,699
How long do I have to pay for a crime
that I didn't commit?

641
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,583
What drugs do you have access to?

642
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,902
None. I work at a lab,
not a hospital.

643
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:03,927
Potassium chloride's easy to get.

644
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:07,915
You could probably make it,
if you were so inclined.

645
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,541
Even if I knew what that was,
I probably couldn't.

646
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:14,336
I'm not a chemist.
Will you show it to them?

647
00:30:14,336 --> 00:30:18,244
This is my client's work records
for the last two weeks.

648
00:30:18,244 --> 00:30:22,152
He lives alone so he has
no alibi for his evenings.

649
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:25,429
Only this time, don't even think
about getting a conviction

650
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:29,028
based solely
on circumstantial evidence.

651
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:38,479
He's absolutely right.

652
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,718
We're gonna have to put
the syringe in his hand

653
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:42,500
if we want to send him up again.

654
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,273
I like him for this.

655
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:45,738
So do I.

656
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:47,767
See what they have on Plummer
at Sing Sing.

657
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,575
Seven years,
he had to make a friend.

658
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,846
I read the file.
It was a good bust, Olivia.

659
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:56,230
The rape victim ID'd Plummer
in a line-up.

660
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,182
Eyewitnesses are always accurate,
right, Munch?

661
00:30:58,182 --> 00:30:59,851
DNA wasn't used then.

662
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:01,831
The guy wasn't working,
didn't have an alibi,

663
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:03,066
couldn't remember where he was

664
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:06,400
Where were you Thursday night
two weeks ago, say, 8:45?

665
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,902
- I don't know, home.
- Exactly.

666
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:13,427
This guy was an innocent man
and I helped put him away.

667
00:31:13,427 --> 00:31:16,303
I made the People's case against him
with weak evidence.

668
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:17,958
That jury believed me.

669
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,901
How many innocent men
have been cleared lately with DNA?

670
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:21,925
A few.

671
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:24,776
And even one wrongfully
imprisoned man is too many.

672
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,404
You sound like a legal aid lawyer.

673
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:27,904
They'd lose their lunch
if they had to stomach

674
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:29,303
what we deal with every day.

675
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,537
The guy paid a debt he didn't owe,
but what about the rape victim?

676
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:33,942
She's not getting any justice, either.
The real perp got off.

677
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:35,539
Statute of limitations is up.

678
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:38,255
The system's already got
its pound of flesh from Eric Plummer.

679
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:40,287
He's a victim.

680
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:43,475
If he's your guy,
he's a predator, not a victim.

681
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:46,567
We blame all kinds of people
for creating monsters.

682
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,559
Why not ourselves?

683
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,109
Freeze!
Up against the car now!

684
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:20,011
Take it easy.
Just stay calm. I'm FBI.

685
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:21,632
Let's see some ID.

686
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:32,906
Move! Out of my way!
Out of my way!

687
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,732
Put your weapon away, ma'am.
We're FBI.

688
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:36,156
Why the hell are you tailing me?

689
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,123
Protective detail.

690
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:43,658
- I told Franklin I didn't want one.
- Wasn't the FBI, ma'am.

691
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:46,637
Detective Stabler
ordered the detail.

692
00:32:55,748 --> 00:32:58,144
All right. All right.

693
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:11,083
I didn't tell you about the detail
because I knew you'd refuse.

694
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:15,052
Only the rat squad puts cops on
other cops, Elliott, without telling them.

695
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:18,713
I deserve better than that,
especially from you.

696
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:24,652
You've been under
a lot of stress lately.

697
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:26,531
I've always backed your play.

698
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:29,424
And I did what I had to do.

699
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,497
Guy's murdered four people.

700
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:32,558
What's to stop him
from coming after you, Olivia?

701
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,065
If you can't trust your partner, Elliott,
it's time to get a new one.

702
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:45,589
We have gotten warrants
before based on less.

703
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:47,179
Why are you stonewalling?

704
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:48,856
This is different and you know it.

705
00:33:48,856 --> 00:33:50,507
Once a judge
hears the suspect's history,

706
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:52,166
he's going to bend over
backwards for the guy.

707
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:55,438
I saw him, Alex.
Plummer is stalking me.

708
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:56,585
How did he know where you were

709
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:58,202
when he was in the interview room
being questioned?

710
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,611
He must have overheard.

711
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:02,107
Okay. How many businesses are
in the area near Chauncey's?

712
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:03,764
I don't know, several.

713
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:05,750
Why?
Where are you going with this?

714
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,807
Any decent defense attorney
is going to say

715
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:10,245
that Mr. Plummer was in the area
running errands,

716
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:11,492
that it was just a coincidence.

717
00:34:11,492 --> 00:34:15,876
He has killed four people
and we're doing nothing.

718
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:18,615
How many drinks did you have?

719
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:22,975
Olivia, the system
made a mistake before,

720
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:27,323
now everything we do
is under a microscope.

721
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:31,249
I wasn't drunk.

722
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:43,902
Now, under the circumstances,
I'm willing to cut you some slack,

723
00:34:43,902 --> 00:34:46,311
but we don't try for search warrants
until I say so.

724
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:48,508
I had to do something.

725
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:50,241
I saw Plummer.

726
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:52,594
I don't doubt you, Olivia.

727
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,295
Okay.

728
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:03,026
Captain, I have some
vacation time coming.

729
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:07,170
Why would you want to do that?

730
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,904
Because I want it too much

731
00:35:09,904 --> 00:35:11,934
and I think I need some distance.

732
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:14,537
Nobody's questioning your abilities.

733
00:35:14,537 --> 00:35:16,703
I am.

734
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:24,998
All right. If you need the time,
take it. As of now.

735
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,880
Thank you.

736
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:49,497
We checked into the suspect's
history at Sing Sing?

737
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:51,326
Warden says Plummer
started a lot of fights.

738
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:54,358
That's good survival strategy.
Nobody can get you in the hole.

739
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:57,177
Only visitor he had was his ex-wife,
even after the divorce.

740
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:58,650
They corresponded almost daily.

741
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,828
Well, who was Plummer's cellmate?

742
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,609
Murderer by the name
of Russell Williams.

743
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:03,216
He got paroled in 2000.

744
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:06,705
He's currently at Rikers Island
awaiting trial on another murder beef.

745
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:07,770
He's going to want a deal,

746
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,993
but if the D.A.
has a strong case against him,

747
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:11,815
he'll show us the door.

748
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,038
Office of Executive Assistant
District Attorney
Friday, March 2

749
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:16,262
Absolutely not.

750
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:18,083
Russell Williams killed a drug dealer.

751
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,091
A life is a life.

752
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:20,911
Who are we to decide
whose has more value?

753
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:22,332
Do you really want me
to show the D.A.

754
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:26,133
photos of a dead 10-year-old boy
dumped among rotting corpses?

755
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:34,022
I've got Williams dead to rights.

756
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:36,407
This time we could
put him away for good.

757
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:37,674
But if he's got something
we can use,

758
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:41,162
why can't we offer him 12.5-to-25?

759
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:46,664
Now, what did Eric do
to get you all heated up

760
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,747
and willing to grab your ankles?

761
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:51,300
We're wasting our time.
This interview is over!

762
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,981
Eric had a thing
for some female cop.

763
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:55,896
That's all he talked about.

764
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:57,013
Do you have proof?

765
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:58,885
Think I got it on videotape?

766
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,350
You word isn't good enough.

767
00:37:02,706 --> 00:37:05,220
How about hand delivered letters?

768
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:08,378
Delivered by whom?

769
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:12,358
From my hand to my old lady
to Eric's wife.

770
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:14,973
The old prison express.

771
00:37:14,973 --> 00:37:16,971
Avoids the warden's censors.

772
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:19,017
If he talked to me,

773
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:22,274
what do you think
he spilled to his old lady?

774
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,551
Home of Eric Plummer
274 West 87th Street
Friday, March 2

775
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:30,869
You find letters at the ex-wife's
apartment? / Couple dozen.

776
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:32,964
There's enough to charge
Mrs. Plummer with accessory.

777
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:35,406
News clippings, photos of Olivia
with the victims,

778
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:37,828
the obsessive ramblings
of a man on a mission.

779
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:39,514
It's Benson's collar.
Shouldn't she be here?

780
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,533
Yeah, I left a message
on her machine. She knows.

781
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:42,832
Bingo.

782
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:51,191
Let's pick up Plummer.

783
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:53,273
This is harassment.

784
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,018
I need to know
where Webber is working today.

785
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:57,403
Norman told me the whole story,
how you put him in prison.

786
00:37:57,403 --> 00:38:00,459
He was exonerated.
First your partner, now you.

787
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:01,633
Why don't you
leave the man in peace?

788
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:02,797
What about my partner?

789
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:05,042
She was here earlier
threatening me with obstruction.

790
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:07,522
I gave her the address
so she'd leave.

791
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:09,283
Where is he?

792
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,083
This is Detective
Olivia Benson, from the 16,

793
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,867
badge number 44015.

794
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:43,669
Shots fired at 653 Avenue D,
Apartment 2.

795
00:38:46,914 --> 00:38:49,657
He says you have to come in.

796
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,549
I can't.

797
00:38:53,549 --> 00:38:55,928
He's going to kill me!

798
00:38:55,928 --> 00:38:58,509
He's not going to hurt you.

799
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:00,707
He knew you were coming.

800
00:39:00,707 --> 00:39:01,938
He says...

801
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:05,776
He says to tell you
they didn't suffer.

802
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,353
He says I won't be so lucky.

803
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:09,739
Oh, God!

804
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:13,719
I'm coming in!

805
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:24,437
This is between us, Mr. Plummer.

806
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:26,577
Why don't you let her go,

807
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:28,182
and then it's just you and me?

808
00:39:28,182 --> 00:39:29,664
How does it feel, Detective Benson,

809
00:39:29,664 --> 00:39:33,970
to have your credibility shattered
and your life in ruins?

810
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,806
It sucks.

811
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,655
I was innocent.

812
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:39,697
Yes, you were.

813
00:39:39,993 --> 00:39:42,806
But then you killed
four innocent people.

814
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:44,580
Three innocent people,
one child abuser.

815
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,181
I thought cops cared
about the facts.

816
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:48,984
Why did you choose them?

817
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:54,932
They were suffering and
they needed their misery to end.

818
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:57,831
Who was going to help them?
You?

819
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:00,508
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

820
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:02,755
I really am.

821
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:05,083
I can't turn back the clock,

822
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,915
but I can testify for you on your behalf

823
00:40:07,915 --> 00:40:12,582
and I can admit in open court
that I am responsible for you.

824
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:17,522
There's not going to be a trial.
Not this time.

825
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,530
Let her go and
let's just talk about it.

826
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,433
There's nothing to discuss.

827
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:26,071
Please, Mr. Plummer,

828
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:29,874
don't think I won't.

829
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,727
Yeah, I'm counting on it,
Detective Benson.

830
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:37,112
Don't do it!
Drop the weapon!

831
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:39,263
Drop your weapon!

832
00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:42,254
There aren't any bullets in my gun.

833
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:12,318
Olivia, it's okay, it's okay.

834
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:15,780
It's okay.

835
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,972
It wasn't loaded.

836
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,956
Okay, let's go.

837
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,057
- I gotta give my statement.
- I'll take you.

838
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:33,664
You leave me alone.

839
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,437
