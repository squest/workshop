00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:00,163
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:03,899
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:05,065
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:08,133
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:11,703
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,544
These are their stories,

7
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:17,647
You just send 1 00 bucks
to the guy at the top,
recruit 10 more guys,

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,244
couple of weeks
you got $10,000.

9
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:20,584
Scam, Gordy.

10
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:23,750
It's not. My cousin done it.
Made a mint.

11
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:25,191
Watch the glass.

12
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,252
It's a pyramid scheme.
Guys at the top get rich.

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,230
Schmucks below them
don't see a dime.

14
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:30,663
Who's your cousin,
Kenneth Lay?

15
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:32,564
No, Joe Stiltson.

16
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:35,804
Damn it. Watch out.
There's oil or something.

17
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:39,698
Are you coming?
This ain't getting
any Iighter.

18
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:40,765
It's illegal, Gordy.

19
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:42,640
You get people to invest,
you...

20
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,812
Holy hell.

21
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,079
PARAMEDIC:
Victim's in her teens,

22
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:52,553
You get a name?
No.

23
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:55,318
Attacker's name?
Non-responsive
the whole ride over.

24
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:56,653
She say anything
at the scene?

25
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:58,819
Just, "He raped me."
Then she was out again.

26
00:00:58,895 --> 00:00:59,953
In Trauma 4.

27
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,462
There.
DOCTOR:
Pupils fixed and dilated.

28
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,128
Fresh blood in the ear canal.

29
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:07,294
She's got a skull fracture
and multiple scalp Iacs.

30
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,598
Regular rate and rhythm.

31
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:12,107
She's a rape victim.
We have to preserve
hair and fiber evidence.

32
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:15,167
BP is 140 over 90.
DOCTOR: Lung sounds
clear bilaterally.

33
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:16,973
Abdomen's rigid.
Pressure's falling.

34
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:18,980
Start a unit of O-neg
and get her to the OR.

35
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:20,140
She's bleeding
into her belly.

36
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:21,877
Wait, wait, wait.
Did anybody start
a rape kit?

37
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,646
NURSE: Come on, Iet's go.
Got to move.

38
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,845
We're Iosing her. Get that!

39
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:25,945
Hold the door!

40
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,649
DOCTOR: Come on, guys.
Let's go.
Move it, move it, move it.

41
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:28,781
Any signs of fluids?

42
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:31,418
BP's 80 palp.
Still tachy at 120.

43
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,485
PIease, you're taking
my DNA evidence.

44
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:35,690
Just one swab?
And an oral?

45
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:39,132
DOCTOR: Coming through.
There's a stain on her thigh.

46
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:40,464
If you could
just give me that?
NURSE: Here.

47
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:43,130
DOCTOR: Coming through.
Let's go. Let's go!

48
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:46,764
This area is sterile.
You're not going to
contaminate my OR.

49
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:49,539
If I could just get
a fingernail scraping...
You're done.

50
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,283
Hopefully we've got DNA
in here.

51
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:59,844
So get it straight over
to the ME's office.
Right.

52
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:01,981
Then voucher the clothes
and drop them
at the police Iab.

53
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:04,117
The ME first, Iab second.
You got it?

54
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:06,684
CIothes. Where are
the clothes? Here we go.

55
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,762
They didn't do
a full rape kit.

56
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:11,527
Only had time between
the ER and the OR,

57
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,535
and then, you know,
they wash everything
away with betadyne, so...

58
00:02:13,603 --> 00:02:14,695
She didn't make it.
Huh?

59
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,238
Our victim.
She died on the table.

60
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:20,765
I got in the way.
They were trying
to save her Iife

61
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:22,572
and I was trying
to make a collar.
I got in the way.

62
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:25,273
No. The doctor said
there was massive
internal bleeding.

63
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:27,873
She blew a clot.
There's nothing
anyone could have done.

64
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,939
Nothing.

65
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,946
Okay.
So Iet's canvass
the neighborhood.

66
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:36,958
Get a name for
the death certificate.
Emily Porter.

67
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:41,190
Paramedics cut off
her jacket in the bus,
found this in her pocket.

68
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:43,961
Percocet. You got an address?

69
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,295
From the pharmacy.

70
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:47,598
WOMAN ON PA: Dr, Russ,
report to the main room
immediately,

71
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,797
Let's go notify
the parents.

72
00:02:55,745 --> 00:02:57,542
Hi. Is your mom or dad home?

73
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,046
Mom, door!

74
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:02,649
Are you here
to pay condolences?

75
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,147
Oh. My grandma died
Iast night.

76
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:10,650
Yes?

77
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,755
Mrs. Porter?

78
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:13,886
Yes.

79
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:15,794
Are you the mother
of Emily Porter?

80
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,865
No. I'm Emily Porter.

81
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:12,415
I've never seen her before.

82
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:14,513
Your drugs were
found on her.

83
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:16,885
Drugs? I'm not taking any...

84
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:21,390
I had a root canal
two weeks ago,

85
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:22,453
but they made me Ioopy.

86
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:25,591
Do you have any idea
how they Ieft the premises?

87
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,334
Heather?

88
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,509
Did the pills kill her?

89
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,774
No, we just need
to know who she is.

90
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:40,642
I don't know her.
I swear.

91
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:42,115
But you did give her
the pills?

92
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:43,208
No!

93
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,712
There's this guy.

94
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:48,951
Everyone at
the skateboard park
talks about him.

95
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,356
He'II buy anything
you give him.

96
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,189
STABLER: What's his name?

97
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,789
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

98
00:04:58,701 --> 00:04:59,827
Doc.

99
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:03,761
Nice office.
You got an appointment?

100
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,067
Man, I don't take walk-ins.

101
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:07,041
Looking for some Vicodin.

102
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,771
Well, you need
a prescription for that.
You got a prescription?

103
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:12,439
Normally I would have one,
but today I'm working
on my own.

104
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,574
My partner, he has some
kind of dignitary duty.

105
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,982
They carting his ass around
in a Iimo. You believe that?

106
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,281
What the hell
you talking about, man?

107
00:05:18,354 --> 00:05:20,822
Sorry. I just needed
to vent.

108
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,950
Bring your ass here.
Who is she?

109
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:25,425
I don't know.
Okay.

110
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:27,428
I'm going in.
Going to charge you
with everything I find.

111
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:28,929
Come on. No.

112
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:31,330
Want me to stop going
through your pockets?
You tell me who she is.

113
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,061
Okay, okay. Look,
I don't know her name,

114
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:35,831
but she came in, Iike,
10:00 this morning,
bought some happy pills.

115
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:38,999
You're a regular
one-stop shop here.
What do you got, fake ID?

116
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,168
Ready to make a deal
or you want me to go
into pocket number three?

117
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:42,335
There's nothing else to tell.

118
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:45,005
I mean,
she came incognito with
a hat down over her eyes.

119
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,070
Describe the hat.

120
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,412
It was black.
Kind of shiny and floppy.

121
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:49,678
Mention where she was going?

122
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:50,810
No.

123
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,050
I mean,
but, you know,
she was a cute Iittle hottie,

124
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:55,886
and I watched her
walk across the street
into the Royal Arms.

125
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,550
Get your ass up.

126
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:04,755
Sorry.

127
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,563
She was wearing
a black floppy hat.

128
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:09,536
FIoppy. Look, Iike this.
Covered half her face.

129
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:11,402
Oh, okay. The cutie pie.

130
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:12,941
She met a guy
in the Iobby.

131
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,869
STABLER: She a pro?

132
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:16,275
Didn't Iook Iike one.

133
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:17,812
Could you describe the guy?

134
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,711
CIientele tends to blur.

135
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:22,683
But white, 30s, kind of buff.

136
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:26,617
Are you telling me this wasn't
a business transaction?

137
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,384
He was trying to hump her
in the Iobby.

138
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:31,153
She's Miss Arm's Length.
"Let's sit and talk."

139
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:33,252
He practically
dragged her up the stairs.

140
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,318
Did she ask for help?

141
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:35,523
Nah.

142
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,862
We're going to need his name
and his room number.

143
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,569
Dover, Room 406. Paid cash.

144
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:46,767
Ben Dover.

145
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,471
Is he still up there?

146
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,344
We're a by-the-hour
establishment.

147
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,774
Tell me that room
hasn't been cleaned yet.

148
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:58,319
Not since '72.

149
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,548
Looks Iike this is where
she was raped.

150
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,751
If there was a rape.

151
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:05,851
Humor me.
At Ieast give me
that there was a struggle.

152
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:08,897
Bet you there's got to be
a thousand DNA samples
on that bedspread.

153
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,522
From this week alone.

154
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,727
My question is,
how does she wind up dead
two blocks away from here?

155
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,271
She breaks free,
he chases after her,

156
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,307
when he catches up,
bye-bye.

157
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,673
He didn't Ieave
anything here.
But she did.

158
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:23,336
Cute hat.

159
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:24,674
And informative.

160
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:28,005
"Made Exclusively
for Destination."

161
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:35,019
The hats are this way.

162
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:37,690
Pretty swanky.

163
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,819
What's our girl
doing shopping here?

164
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:45,723
They're adorable,
aren't they?
We just got them in.

165
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,632
How much are they?
Seven ninety-five.

166
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:50,763
She managed
to find the only
affordable thing in here.

167
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,570
That would be $795.

168
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:58,303
Oh. Well,
that'II max out
your credit card.

169
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,507
Could you pull
the sales receipts for these?

170
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,948
Certainly.

171
00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:05,316
There can't be that many.
At that price, I don't see
them flying off the shelves.

172
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:07,321
WOMAN:
Well, they're projected to.

173
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,721
Of course, we just
got them in yesterday.

174
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,322
That's odd.
We haven't sold any yet.

175
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,090
Sorry.

176
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:19,191
I understand you caught
a shoplifter for me.

177
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:20,735
Maybe you can return
the favor.

178
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:22,202
We'II settle for a name.

179
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,967
If they'd caught her before,
she'd have been banned
from the store.

180
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,871
Maybe she slipped
by security?

181
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:28,204
She slipped out of here
with that hat.

182
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,245
LAUDEN: My Loss Prevention
Consultant keeps begging me

183
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:33,213
to use those horrible
electronic surveillance tags,

184
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:34,579
but they stretch
the fabrics.

185
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,947
Got her.

186
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:39,746
Why doesn't this one
have a name?

187
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:41,221
February 18.

188
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,121
That was
our President's Day sale.

189
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:44,557
I remember that.

190
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:48,085
She was caught stuffing
a cashmere sweater in her bag.

191
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:49,494
Of course,
we pressed charges.

192
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,931
Then you should
have received
a copy of a "61"

193
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:53,332
or a criminal court
complaint.

194
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,700
Either one should
have her name on it.

195
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:57,629
Nothing.

196
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:59,901
She was picked up
by an Officer SIater.

197
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,503
We never heard back.

198
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:03,234
Yeah, thanks.

199
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,851
Catching any speeders?

200
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:17,222
Do I know you?

201
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:19,022
SIater, right?
Yeah.

202
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,488
SVU.

203
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,329
We caught a Jane Doe
this morning,

204
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:27,767
and every turn
we're coming up blank,

205
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:29,201
ending with you.

206
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:32,797
I don't follow you.
Okay.

207
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,570
This girl pulled
a Winona at Destination

208
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:36,702
two months ago.
You picked her up.

209
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,373
Why can't we find
any arrest records?

210
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,906
She wouldn't give me her name.

211
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:44,316
My sarge says
if she gives it up

212
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:45,876
we'II just give her
a desk appearance.

213
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:47,923
Did she go
for the D.A.T.?

214
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:51,182
Yeah.
Then what's her name?

215
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,056
BENSON: Excuse me.

216
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,261
We need you to pull
a Desk Appearance Ticket

217
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:04,033
issued 2-1802

218
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:05,698
for a Patricia Stephens.

219
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,404
Is that a problem?

220
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,912
Sorry. What was the name?

221
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,313
Stephens.
Stephens, with a "P-H."

222
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:20,313
Steingard, Stelherd, Stemple.

223
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,378
No. I don't see it.

224
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:22,446
Oh, come on.

225
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:25,118
Well, maybe
it was misspelled.
Try it with a "V"'

226
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:27,190
No. Look,
I really have to close.

227
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:29,560
BENSON: Listen, Iady,
the girl's dead.

228
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:32,064
So if she's got parents,
I'm not going to Iet them
spend the night

229
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,897
going out of their mind
not knowing,

230
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,164
so please keep Iooking.

231
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:37,637
Patricia's dead?

232
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:39,196
STABLER:
You know this girl?

233
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:42,007
You don't know who she is,
do you?

234
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:44,944
That's what we've spent
this entire miserable day
trying to find out.

235
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,447
Who is she?

236
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:49,209
Judge Thornburg's daughter.

237
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:54,354
Why did it have to
be the stepdaughter
of a hanging judge?

238
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:58,325
Thornburg's sentence on
the SoHo Youth Center rapes
came down Iast week.

239
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:01,362
Father Kelly's
doing 25-to-Iife
before he burns in hell.

240
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,627
And we get to pay him back by
telling him his pill-popping,
shoplifting stepdaughter

241
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,066
was murdered Ieaving
some seedy sex hotel.

242
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:08,160
CRAGEN: Yeah? What?

243
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:10,865
Came by to Iet you know
we ID'd the girl.
Good.

244
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,429
Going to notify
the parents.

245
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,271
Worst part of the job.
Sorry.

246
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,401
Yeah, well, this one
hit one of our own.

247
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:18,309
CRAGEN: A cop's daughter?
A judge's.

248
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,642
Thornburg.

249
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,512
I know Walt.
Who doesn't?

250
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:26,053
We've testified
in his court
a hundred times.

251
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:28,983
We have history.

252
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,355
We both went to St. John's.

253
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:31,984
I run into Walt
at every function.

254
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:33,153
He has two small sons.

255
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:34,718
I didn't even know
he had a daughter.

256
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:36,662
Stepdaughter.
She was 16.

257
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:37,960
So it's true?

258
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:40,728
It's already hit
the courthouse grapevine?

259
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:41,997
This is huge.

260
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:43,197
My boss is going
to want to know

261
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:44,398
where you are
on this every minute.

262
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,737
Well, tell her
we're going to notify
the judge and his wife

263
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,037
before Channel 5 does.

264
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,634
CRAGEN: No, it's okay.

265
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:52,842
I'm doing this one.

266
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,313
Don.

267
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:00,644
Hello, Brook.

268
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:03,383
Is Walter here?

269
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,653
He's in the den.

270
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,393
Is something wrong?

271
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,857
Why don't you
go Iie down?

272
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,903
We have to tell
Josh and Brian.

273
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,938
CRAGEN:
I won't keep you Iong.

274
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,572
She was raped?

275
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:23,305
We're investigating it
as a rape-homicide, yes.

276
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:24,972
When?

277
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:27,205
She was found
about 11:00 this morning.

278
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:29,372
Where?

279
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:31,310
Hell's Kitchen.

280
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,789
Do you have any idea
what she would be doing
in that part of town?

281
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,324
No.
Does Brook have
to be here for this?

282
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:38,154
No. No. Of course not.

283
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:39,592
I'II be with you
in a minute, okay?

284
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:40,787
AII right.

285
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:47,464
We can drop
the niceties now.

286
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,635
She's been a problem child
since puberty.

287
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:53,901
Trust me.

288
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:58,173
I am Iong past the point
of being shocked.

289
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,841
What kind of trouble
had she been in?

290
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,241
When Brook and I
got together

291
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,377
five years ago,
she went wild.

292
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,485
We tried discipline,
therapy.

293
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:11,321
Finally had to send
her to boarding school.

294
00:13:11,393 --> 00:13:13,361
How Iong had
she been back?

295
00:13:13,428 --> 00:13:15,589
A year,
going to St. Monica's.

296
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,960
Brook got a phone call
from the school this morning.

297
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,333
Patricia ditched
just after roll call.

298
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:24,932
What did you do?

299
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:28,871
Absolutely nothing.

300
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:35,672
Truancy was
just her Iatest method
of torturing Brook and me.

301
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,810
Before that
it was body piercing.

302
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:39,478
Before that it was a tattoo.

303
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:47,459
TREVOR: Doesn't match
any known gang tats.

304
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,894
STABLER: Do we know
what she was hit with?

305
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:50,932
ME pulled glass shards
out of her scalp,

306
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:52,296
which match
color and thickness

307
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,698
with a broken
beer bottle found here.

308
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,100
That's where
she took the blow.

309
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,297
Yes.
But see the spatter pattern?

310
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:59,067
Based on its trajectory,
and height of the victim,

311
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,870
I'd say
she was standing here,

312
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:02,877
while her attacker
came at her from the south,

313
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,674
swinging from right to Ieft.

314
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:07,681
From here, droplets of blood
form a serpentine pattern
to the stairs.

315
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:08,738
STABLER:
She was staggering?

316
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,216
And continue
down the steps,

317
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:12,014
alternating between
round drops and smudges,

318
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:13,850
suggesting she cartwheeled
head-over-heels.

319
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:15,856
Smudges being where
her head hit the steps?

320
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,949
Until she Ianded
hard at the bottom,

321
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,721
where she Iay unconscious
for at Ieast 15 minutes,

322
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:21,763
as you can see
from the pool of blood.

323
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,663
This bottle, any pieces
big enough for prints?

324
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,891
Follow me.

325
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:29,062
After identifying
the type of bottle used,

326
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:32,766
I bought the same brand
and filled it
with plaster of Paris.

327
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:37,335
Now comes the fun part.

328
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,645
We tap-tap-tap all over,
cracking it Iike an egg.

329
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:46,254
And then
we take the glass
from the crime scene,

330
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:47,948
which I have right here.

331
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:49,923
You Iike jigsaw puzzles,
Detective?

332
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:53,958
You're kidding me.
There must be a thousand
pieces in there.

333
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:57,059
Nine hundred and ninety-nine
to go.

334
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:58,793
I'II Iet you know
if I get a print.

335
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:04,365
SISTER KAY:
Patricia was a smart girl

336
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:07,340
and the classes
she showed up for,
she did very well in.

337
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,604
Unfortunately she was
a discipline problem.

338
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:10,702
Fights?

339
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,612
No. Her hostility
was restricted
to authority figures.

340
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:14,706
A rule breaker.

341
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:18,116
She'd talk back,
walk into class
10 minutes after the bell,

342
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:20,780
and we suspected
she was defiling
her body.

343
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,687
You're talking about
her tattoo and piercings?

344
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:24,817
That and she was sent
to the nurse's office

345
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:26,451
a few months ago
with cuts on her arms.

346
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,826
Wait.
She was cutting herself?

347
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:29,921
Yes.

348
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:31,022
How often?

349
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,691
Just the once that we know of.

350
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,998
If she was cutting,
it was a cry for help.

351
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,630
Or a way to make herself
feel alive.

352
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:38,934
Did she have
any friends here?

353
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,272
It was sad. She never
did manage to fit in.

354
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:44,904
There's only one girl
I ever saw her friendly with.

355
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,709
And where can we find her?

356
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:53,014
BENSON: Making up for
the classes you ditched?

357
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,255
Am I in trouble?

358
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:59,590
You were
with Tricia Stephens
yesterday, weren't you?

359
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,789
I can't believe
she's dead.

360
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:07,792
Mary, you need to tell us
everything that happened.

361
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,030
I never should have Ieft her.

362
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:12,300
Left her where?

363
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:14,597
Destination.

364
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:16,940
I never skip school,
I swear.

365
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:18,274
Trish dragged me along.

366
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:19,939
To steal a hat?

367
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:21,642
I had no idea
she was going to do it.

368
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:23,708
I was furious,
so I took off.

369
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,616
How Iong had you been friends?

370
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,348
Practically
since she came here.

371
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:28,985
We both Iove the classics.

372
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:31,355
Sophocles, Euripides,
Aeschylus...

373
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:32,484
BENSON: Tragedies.

374
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,426
We were both very drawn
to them.

375
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,164
And why is that?
She having boyfriend troubles?

376
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:40,429
No. Trish never
had a boyfriend.
I mean, not really.

377
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:43,202
Define "really"'

378
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,902
Well, there are guys
that she wrote to.

379
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,805
Like pen pals?
Right.

380
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:53,072
How many?

381
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:54,172
A bunch.

382
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:55,546
She didn't think
her parents would understand,

383
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,608
so all the Ietters
came to my house.

384
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:00,654
Why was she afraid
to tell her parents?

385
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:01,916
They were strict.

386
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,981
They didn't
get the real Trish.
She had a good heart.

387
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,028
She was doing God's work.
Reaching out to Iost souls.

388
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:09,123
Who was she writing to?

389
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:12,131
Prisoners.

390
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,601
Funny,
for a tragedy buff,

391
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:18,263
I haven't seen
any references yet

392
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,807
to Hamlet or King Lear.

393
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,604
Wasn't it Shakespeare
who wrote,

394
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,940
"I want to do you
on the stove top"?

395
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:25,536
Where did you find these?

396
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:27,275
Patricia's school Iocker.

397
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:30,608
She's been
pen-palling with
five different convicts.

398
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:33,449
Ray Dayton, Thomas Gordon.

399
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:36,719
Dayton went away
for murder two.
Gordon, man one.

400
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,886
John Furmen, Louis Knapp,
AIden Reed.

401
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:42,452
Murder, murder,
and, what do you know?

402
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:43,759
Murder.

403
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:45,732
This girl wanted for nothing.

404
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:48,201
Good family, money,
best education.

405
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,170
Now what was she doing
writing to killers?

406
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,762
It's the ultimate rebellion.

407
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,206
I mean, Iook at preachers'
kids, principals' kids.

408
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,607
FIN: Cops' kids.

409
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:58,174
Hey, good girls
go for bad boys.

410
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,373
From what I hear,
this girl was nothing
but trouble.

411
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,144
Death Row inmates
get the most groupies

412
00:18:02,217 --> 00:18:04,879
and those whack jobs come
from all walks of Iife.

413
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:07,285
What years were these
five skels convicted?

414
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:08,720
AII early '90s.

415
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,350
Time off for good behavior,
any one of them could be
out on parole.

416
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:12,950
Why don't you
give me that Iist?

417
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:14,996
I'II have Cabot check
in the D.A"s system.

418
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:17,497
No. I'II handle this.

419
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:22,060
One of your guys
is at Sing Sing,

420
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:24,435
three are at Attica
and one just got out
a week ago.

421
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:27,270
Which one?
Thomas "Bird" Gordon.

422
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:31,574
Got the max for man one.
Actually did 12 of the 15.

423
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:34,342
Seems Mr. Gordon gets
a Iittle grabby with women.

424
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,283
Priors include two counts
of sex abuse three.

425
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,014
Don,
I think you better
take a Iook at this.

426
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:43,515
See their trial judges?

427
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:49,655
It's Thornburg.

428
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:53,030
Daddy's a judge
and she's seeking out
the men he convicted.

429
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,069
What is going on
with this girl?

430
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,208
(SIREN WAILING)

431
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:08,408
What happened here?

432
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:09,848
OFFICER: A guy got shot.

433
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:13,376
They took him
to the hospital.
Said he's a judge.

434
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:15,116
Judge Thornburg.

435
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:24,394
Here you go.
Thanks.

436
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,127
How is he?

437
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:29,398
He's still in surgery.
No one will tell me
anything.

438
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,132
I know this is difficult.

439
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,002
But can you tell me
what happened?

440
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,345
I was in the kitchen
with Josh and Brian.

441
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:42,615
The housekeeper was
helping me make Iunch.
I'd...

442
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,487
I'd just talked to
Walter on his cell,

443
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,853
to see if he wanted
a sandwich, too.

444
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,915
Take your time. Let's...

445
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:55,324
About five minutes Iater

446
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,020
there was a shot,

447
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,623
just Iike
it was outside the door.

448
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:03,533
And I rushed out there

449
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:05,697
and he was on the ground,
bleeding.

450
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:07,241
Did you see anyone?

451
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,202
I didn't Iook.

452
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:13,440
AII I could see was Walter.

453
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,378
It doesn't make any sense.

454
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:18,209
Where was he coming from?

455
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:20,280
Court.

456
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,624
He'd gone in to
clear his calendar,

457
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:30,397
then we were going to
make funeral arrangements.

458
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:37,001
Mrs. Thornburg,
is there anybody
that you could think of

459
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:39,666
that might want to
hurt your husband?

460
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,703
(SIGHS)

461
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,836
No. I mean...

462
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:49,007
I'm sure there are people
he's sent to prison

463
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:51,045
that are holding grudges,

464
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:54,888
but we haven't received
any threats.

465
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:00,022
Did you know that
your daughter was writing

466
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,593
to some of the men
that your husband put away?

467
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,461
What?

468
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:09,729
We're Iooking at
one of them as a suspect
in your daughter's murder.

469
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:12,466
She ever mention someone
called Thomas Gordon?

470
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,337
No.

471
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:21,609
Do you think he's the one
who tried to kill my husband?

472
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:29,315
He's been out a week.
Don't tell me he's broken
his parole already.

473
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:31,757
He's Iooking good
for a rape-murder.
That fit your guy?

474
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,020
Like a glass slipper.

475
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:34,721
Right before
he got sent up,

476
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,127
my Iittle princess
was a suspect

477
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:38,324
in a rash of break-in
rapes in Brooklyn.

478
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,662
Never enough to arrest.

479
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:40,860
What's your take
on this guy?

480
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:42,300
The guy's got
a faulty transmitter.

481
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,928
Doesn't receive signals
too clearly.

482
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:46,064
Ladies say "no,"
he hears "yes"'

483
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:48,237
But he never killed
one of them.

484
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,334
How'd your girl buy it?

485
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,503
STABLER: Bottle to the head.

486
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:52,307
Tumbled down
a flight of stairs.

487
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:54,212
Deja vu.

488
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,708
Tommy's
manslaughter convictions
stem from a bar fight.

489
00:21:57,786 --> 00:21:59,151
Severed a guy's carotid.

490
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,209
FIN: With what?

491
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:01,516
His version?

492
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,353
The other guy threw himself
on the broken beer bottle

493
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:05,916
he just happened
to be holding.

494
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:07,052
Where's he at?

495
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:10,655
He was paroled to
his sister's address
in Queens.

496
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:12,996
Works at her husband's garage.

497
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:16,165
What do you want with Tommy?

498
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:17,636
We need to have
a Iittle chat with him.

499
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:20,402
Why don't you Ieave a card
and I'II have him give you
a call?

500
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:23,672
2:00 in the afternoon
and he's done for the day?

501
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:25,940
So much for
Employee of the Month, huh?

502
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:28,175
He's on parole. You need
to tell us where he is.

503
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:30,240
Tell me
what you want with him.

504
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:31,751
The judge
who sent your brother up,

505
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,048
someone took
a potshot at him.

506
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:36,284
Good, because that judge
had it out for Tommy
from the beginning.

507
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:37,518
Tommy did not do it.

508
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:39,219
Did he come to work
yesterday?

509
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:41,387
Yeah.
He comes to work every day.

510
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:43,795
Is that true, Mr. Degalio?

511
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,696
My wife,
she dotes on that worm.

512
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,031
The second he shows up,
I find things to do
in the attic.

513
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:49,092
Tony!

514
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,467
Shut up, Sharlene.

515
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:53,234
Yeah, he showed up.
Just Iong enough to
ask for the morning off.

516
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:54,900
FIN: What for?

517
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,467
The guy's a sludge.
He's been in prison
a Iong time.

518
00:22:57,545 --> 00:22:59,274
He said he was getting
a piece of tail.

519
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:01,508
What, is there a Iaw
against that?

520
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,251
Did he mention
this piece of tail by name?

521
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,184
Yeah. "Sweet young thing"'

522
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:08,379
The way he goes on,
she's burning hot for him.

523
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:10,253
Cat-in-heat hot.
Wants to do these things...

524
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:12,020
Okay,
they get the picture.

525
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:14,323
What time did
he clock back in?
See, that's the thing.

526
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:16,455
He not only
doesn't show up
for the rest of the day,

527
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:19,022
he never returns my van,
that Iow-Iife Ioser.

528
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,897
You're telling me he didn't
come home Iast night?

529
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,027
Of course he did.

530
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:23,730
Sir?
TONY: No, he didn't.

531
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:25,102
Describe the van.

532
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:29,735
'97 Ford E-150.
Customized it myself.

533
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:34,305
Hydraulic camshaft,
351-Windsor V8,
dual exhaust...

534
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:35,679
Just need a plate number.

535
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:38,745
BQY-2064.

536
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,878
STABLER: And maybe a color?

537
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:42,388
Gold four-tone paint job
with flames.

538
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:45,488
Thanks for your help.

539
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:49,757
Got uniforms on the judge
and his wife round the clock.

540
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:52,823
Good.
Yeah, you heard me right.
Gold with flames.

541
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,391
Tommy have any friends?

542
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:56,130
None who made the trip
upstate to visit.

543
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:57,967
FIN: Other than Sis,
no Iiving relatives.

544
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,199
Well, he's out there,
people,

545
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:01,208
and according to ballistics
from the judge's shooting,

546
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:03,267
armed with
a.380 semi-automatic.

547
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:05,005
He simmered in the cage
for 12 years,

548
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,569
building up hate,
planning his revenge.

549
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:08,275
He's out one week,
we already Iike him

550
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:09,907
for attempted murder,
rape-homicide.

551
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,315
BENSON:
High stress on the run.

552
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:12,580
He's not going down easy.

553
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:15,487
Well, I say
he's going to get
back to his comfort zone.

554
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:17,081
We know any
of his old haunts?

555
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:20,889
Well, he was busted
for drunk and disorderly
at a place called O'Malley's.

556
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:23,396
His sex charges stem
from playing grab-ass
with some stripper

557
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:24,523
down in the Bowery.

558
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,533
Split up. Hit them all.

559
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,707
(MUSIC PLAYING)

560
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:44,311
Seen this ugly mug around?

561
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:45,613
Oh, yeah, that's Bird.

562
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:47,951
He used to come in
back when I was performing.

563
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:49,387
Prison didn't teach him
no manners.

564
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,186
He still can't
keep his hands
to himself.

565
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,692
When was the Iast time
he was in here?

566
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,159
A couple days ago.

567
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:55,787
He was pounding them down
all afternoon.

568
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:58,162
Keeps trying to hit on
Sheila over there.

569
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:01,760
Suddenly he jumps up
on the stage and starts
doing the hump dance with her.

570
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:04,930
Tossed him out on his head,
told him never to come back.

571
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:07,167
You think
I could talk to Sheila?

572
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:09,210
Twenty bucks will get you
three minutes.

573
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:14,944
So, Tommy Bird,
did he ever get violent
with any of the girls?

574
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,005
Not that I heard of.

575
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:19,212
But the more sloshed he gets,
the more touchy-feely.

576
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:20,652
Looks Iike a cop.

577
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:23,589
She's cool.
Wants to know
about the humpmeister.

578
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:25,023
Bad tipper.

579
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:31,592
So, you had a conversation
with him?

580
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:32,690
Yeah.

581
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,632
I say, "Leave me alone,"
he don't Iisten.

582
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:37,296
He keeps after me
to hook up after work.

583
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:38,703
Did he have a place in mind?

584
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:40,934
Yeah, some bar
up the street. Falcone's.

585
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,804
Hello, Thomas.

586
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,473
I've been sitting on the van.
Any sign of him?

587
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,314
No, but I found something
very interesting
while I was waiting.

588
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:53,183
FIN: You got a warrant?

589
00:25:53,254 --> 00:25:55,848
That's all I'm waiting for
to make it Iegal for me
to take this.

590
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:57,721
There's our.380.

591
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:00,022
Recently fired.
Let's do it.

592
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:06,924
(MUSIC PLAYING)

593
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:10,899
Sit down.

594
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:19,810
What's going on?

595
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:21,849
Arresting your punk ass.
For what?

596
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,907
Parole violation.
Oh, man.

597
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:26,385
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can...

598
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:27,785
Can I just finish my beer?

599
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,322
He's clean.
Let's go.

600
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,584
You got a right to attorney.

601
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:32,819
You puke in my car
I'm going to kill your ass.

602
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:35,419
If you cannot afford
an attorney, one will be...

603
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,195
Tommy, we got you.

604
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:42,896
Your DNA matches the fluids
we found in Patricia Stephens.

605
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:45,870
Never heard of her.
Oh, come on,
your sweet young thing.

606
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,202
The one with the floppy hat?

607
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,470
If that bitch is saying rape,
she's Iying.

608
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:51,409
Oh, Tommy,
she's not saying anything.

609
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,912
She's dead.

610
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:54,572
What?

611
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:56,005
No way.

612
00:26:57,051 --> 00:26:58,382
She was alive
when I Ieft her.

613
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:00,478
You raped her,
you beat her to a bloody pulp

614
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,420
and you Ieft her to die
while you tracked down
her old man.

615
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,219
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, yeah!

616
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:07,284
Sweetheart, we matched
the bullet to your gun.

617
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:09,925
AII right, Iook.

618
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:11,465
Maybe I took
a shot at the judge,

619
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:12,965
but he sabotaged
my defense.

620
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:14,433
He blocked my parole.

621
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,868
Twelve prime years
wasted in prison?
I'd want someone dead.

622
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:19,031
Yeah, but not too quick.
I'd want to torture
him first,

623
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:20,734
maybe rape and kill
the stepdaughter.

624
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:21,797
What are you talking about?

625
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:24,606
I didn't even know
they were related
till yesterday.

626
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,613
Hey, you got to believe me!

627
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:28,876
This shooting thing,
it wasn't my idea.

628
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,975
It was that stupid slut
got me all revved up!

629
00:27:31,052 --> 00:27:33,520
Tommy! Weak, very weak.

630
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,385
Hey, I didn't go
Iooking for her.

631
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:37,349
She wrote to me first.

632
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:39,518
I got the Ietters
to prove it.

633
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:41,794
So why you, Tommy?

634
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:43,821
Why did she pick you?

635
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,228
Chicks.

636
00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:49,162
One day
I'm sitting in my cell,

637
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,534
she writes to me
out of the blue.

638
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:55,565
Promises me sex
beyond my wildest dreams.

639
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,708
You must've done
something really good
in a previous Iife.

640
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:02,482
I thought I finally
found my dream girl.

641
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,281
She said she'd do anything,
anytime, anywhere.

642
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:08,481
Get me anything I needed.

643
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:09,682
And what did you need?

644
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:13,793
I got a condition
requires Percocet.

645
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,294
She said she could
bring me some,

646
00:28:15,363 --> 00:28:16,955
but that turned out
to be a Iie, too.

647
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:18,464
Whatever. What happened?

648
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:21,730
I get to the hotel,
I'm primed and ready,
if you know what I mean

649
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:23,293
and all of sudden
she's got a headache.

650
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:25,236
So you raped her!
No.

651
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:27,735
I was past
the point of no return,

652
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,777
so I seduced her.

653
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:34,640
Hey, she knew
what she was doing.

654
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,908
She got me all worked up.

655
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:44,019
Then came the catch.

656
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:46,320
And what was that?

657
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:49,926
Kill her step-daddy.

658
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:02,565
That's bull.

659
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,372
We've got the Ietter
she sent him.

660
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:05,707
He kept all of them,

661
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,509
even though she wrote
on each one "please destroy"'

662
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:10,483
So you have, in writing,
her request to kill her
stepfather?

663
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:11,711
No.
I didn't think so.

664
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:13,879
Did she even mention
who her stepfather was?

665
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:15,286
She does mention a favor.

666
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:17,824
STABLER:
She can't say what it is
until she sees him in person.

667
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:21,555
So you're buying
the ex-con murdering
rapist's version?

668
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:24,530
It's the same charge
whether it's his idea
or somebody else's.

669
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,999
Why would he Iie?
That's what they do.

670
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:28,433
But, Captain,
you got to admit

671
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,232
Patricia was
doing a Iot of
questionable things.

672
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:33,865
Let's just say,
for argument's sake,
that he's not Iying.

673
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,636
Why would she
want him to do it?

674
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:39,379
I don't know.
She was a sick girl.

675
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:45,147
I think as far as
the Captain is concerned,

676
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:46,516
this case is closed.

677
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:47,679
Well, not for me.

678
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:49,518
I want to know
what made her so sick.

679
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:55,519
STABLER: Patricia was not
very popular.

680
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:57,427
BENSON:
Mrs. Thornburg and the boys.

681
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:02,232
Mrs. Thornburg.

682
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,562
Wait.

683
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:06,038
Oh, sorry.
We thought you were...

684
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,665
I'm her sister, Erin.

685
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:09,607
Brook's still
at the hospital.

686
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:11,770
This is Detective Benson.
I'm Detective Stabler.

687
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,438
We were working
Tricia's case.

688
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,514
We came by
to pay our respects.

689
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:18,176
Maybe if we could talk,

690
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:20,949
at a more appropriate time,
of course.

691
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:23,752
Thank God somebody is here
with Tricia's interests
at heart.

692
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:25,656
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
I'm sorry.

693
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:27,387
You know? Why don't I
Iook after them for you?

694
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:30,624
I've got a Iot of experience
wrangling kids.

695
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:35,569
Patricia and the judge
didn't get along?

696
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,069
Oil and water.

697
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:41,269
That must have been
hard on your sister.
Oh, please.

698
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:44,243
Her first husband
abandoned them
when Trish was five.

699
00:30:44,312 --> 00:30:48,009
Brook got a job
as a court reporter,
met the meal ticket.

700
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:49,276
Judge Thornburg.

701
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,217
And she wasn't going
to Iet Trish muck it up.

702
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:54,481
That's why Trish
started acting out.

703
00:30:54,755 --> 00:30:56,814
That was his excuse
to get rid of her,

704
00:30:57,425 --> 00:30:58,790
start his own family.

705
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:03,592
The second she was gone,
they get married.

706
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:04,926
Adopt Brian six months Iater,

707
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,626
get pregnant with Josh
immediately after that.

708
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,532
Instant new family.

709
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,129
And no room for Trish,
who's now conveniently
tucked away

710
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,467
at boarding school.

711
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:16,136
Trish never went
to boarding school.

712
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:18,209
I don't understand.
I thought...

713
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,304
Do you know
what a PINS petition is?

714
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:22,076
Person In Need
of Supervision. Yeah.

715
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:26,017
Just before she turned 12
he swore out one of those.

716
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:28,317
Had her sent to kiddy prison.

717
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:35,823
FIN: No offense.
You really believe

718
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:37,194
she belonged
in a place Iike this?

719
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,823
She'd been chronically
truant,

720
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,527
shoplifting,
breaking curfew.

721
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:42,125
It was a Iegitimate call.

722
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:44,763
For someone
with no other options.
These people had money.

723
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,136
We don't discriminate.

724
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:47,401
These kids are
inner-city throwaways.

725
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:50,035
They could have put Trish
in a boarding school,
a military school.

726
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:52,477
Hell, even a charm school.
Money buys choices.

727
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,810
It is unusual for
a family with means

728
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:56,713
to go through
the family court system.

729
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:58,251
We're talking a judge here.

730
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,719
He knew exactly
what he was throwing her into.

731
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,551
Abused kids,
mentally ill,

732
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:04,818
straight-out
violent head cases.

733
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:06,223
Which one was Trish?

734
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:07,761
In her three years here,

735
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:09,796
she never once
opened up in therapy.

736
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:12,856
Serious trust issues.
What was the root of it?

737
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:19,002
We suspected sexual abuse.

738
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:20,404
Based on?

739
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:25,776
The usual symptoms.
Hypervigilance, exaggerated
startled response, insomnia,

740
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,541
the fact that she'd never
talk about the baby,

741
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:30,846
somatic reactions
Iike nausea,
poor appetite...

742
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:33,478
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What baby?

743
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:40,787
Mrs. Thornburg, could we
talk to you for a moment?

744
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:43,991
I was just taking the boys

745
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:45,396
to the hospital
to see their father.

746
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:47,024
We just have
a few questions,

747
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:49,228
but they'd be better
asked in private.

748
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:54,573
Ida, can you put Josh
in the car?

749
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:05,542
What is it?

750
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:08,747
Why didn't you tell us
about Patricia's pregnancy?

751
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:10,620
What are you talking about?
I think you know.

752
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:12,454
The real reason that you
sent her off to boot camp.

753
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,494
She was 12 years old
and pregnant.

754
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:15,893
You being a good Catholic,

755
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:17,590
an abortion's
out of the question.

756
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:20,566
You didn't send her to an RTC
to straighten her out,

757
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:23,228
you sent her there
to conceal her condition.

758
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:24,498
You don't know
what you're saying.

759
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:27,939
Your adopted son, Brian.
We know he's Tricia's.

760
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,377
How...
We did the math.

761
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:32,878
Tricia had her baby
four years ago.

762
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:34,710
Brian's just the right age.

763
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:37,212
I need to be
with my husband.

764
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:40,115
Mrs. Thornburg,
who's the father?

765
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:47,927
Who's the father
of Tricia's baby?

766
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:55,964
She told me
she didn't even know.

767
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:06,572
They Iied about
the boarding school.

768
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:08,342
Which timelines
with her pregnancy.

769
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,043
Hospital records
just came in.

770
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:13,848
Tricia's unnamed baby
has the same birth date
as Brian.

771
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,183
I'm sorry, Captain.

772
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:18,282
Adopting your underaged,
unwed daughter's baby
is not a crime.

773
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,759
It is if you're the one
who knocked her up.

774
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:21,954
CABOT: Judge Thornburg?

775
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:23,963
One of the most respected
jurists in the state.

776
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:25,396
Which doesn't mean
squat to me

777
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:27,297
if he raped
an 11-year-old girl.

778
00:34:27,368 --> 00:34:29,802
Judge Thornburg.
I can't think of a judge

779
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,497
who is tougher
on child molesters.

780
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:32,971
Maybe he's a self-Ioather.

781
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,064
Liv?

782
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:35,631
There's only
one way to prove it.

783
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:38,803
We have Tricia's DNA
from the ME's office

784
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,177
and Judge Thornburg's
from the crime scene.

785
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,148
AII we need is Brian's.

786
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:53,220
You guys had
better be right.

787
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:57,423
DONNELLY:
Let me get this straight.

788
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,363
You want me
to Iet you take this

789
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,697
to a judge
to sign a blood order,

790
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:04,135
so that you can
take a DNA sample

791
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:07,197
of one of their esteemed
colleagues' four-year-old son

792
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,538
based on nothing more
than a wild theory?

793
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,237
If you'II just Iook
at the attached exhibits.

794
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:12,904
Does anyone allege
that this man

795
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,880
was having sex
with his stepdaughter?

796
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,543
No, but we have
a pattern of conduct.

797
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,785
I have a signed affidavit
from a clerk

798
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:24,518
who made Tricia's most recent
shoplifting charge disappear,

799
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:26,651
at the request
of Judge Thornburg.

800
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:28,888
Ever get a colleague to
fix a ticket for you, AIex?

801
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:30,760
In the past, he manipulated
the system against her.

802
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:32,594
So why is he
covering for her now?

803
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,930
She was holding
something over him.

804
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:35,969
Five years ago,

805
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:37,697
he used the court
to hide his crime,

806
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:39,204
bypass the system.

807
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:44,937
Got a crony
to push through
the detention order.

808
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,377
Had another
colleague falsify

809
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:49,439
Brian's adoption papers
and his birth certificate.
Uh-huh.

810
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:51,314
But no proof of sex.

811
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:53,142
No.

812
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:56,587
Yet, you're willing to risk
your future and my reputation.

813
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,420
Need I remind you
that I am responsible

814
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,585
for the integrity
of this entire bureau?

815
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:04,760
A judge has used
the power of the court
to further his own agenda.

816
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:07,858
If the Iight we shine on him
isn't brighter than the Iight
we shine on the public,

817
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,335
then this bureau
has no integrity.

818
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:17,137
I wouldn't want to be you
if he's not the father.

819
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:32,121
How are you feeling?

820
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:36,255
Not much Iike talking, Don.

821
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:41,433
I'm afraid I have extended
all the professional courtesy
I can.

822
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,238
I'm sure Brook told you
we ran a paternity test
on Brian.

823
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,741
He's yours, Walter.

824
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:56,107
You raped that Iittle girl.

825
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:00,551
Don't ask me
for an explanation.

826
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:05,651
I've searched
the depths of my soul,

827
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:11,259
and I can't for the Iife of me
find one.

828
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,593
What happened?

829
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,769
Did she threaten
to expose you?

830
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,329
Is that why you killed her?

831
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:24,106
You have the person
that killed her,

832
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,879
the scum who shot me.

833
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:32,576
You just don't get it,
do you, Walter? It's over.

834
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:37,513
And the Ieast you could do
is give me the courtesy
of the truth.

835
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:42,619
You can't really believe
that I killed her?

836
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,687
I was your Iast hold-out,

837
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,727
but I had to check.

838
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:50,167
You didn't take the bench
until noon that day.

839
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:53,798
I was in chambers.
That can be easily proved.

840
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:59,808
I'm expecting a call
from the crime Iab,

841
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,815
which, I hope to God,
proves me wrong, Walter.

842
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,653
BENSON: Come on,
that's good enough.

843
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:20,859
Hold on.
It's just going
to take another...

844
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,329
You're done.

845
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:29,808
Okay. It just needs
to dry completely.

846
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:32,345
Or I could give it
the old college try.

847
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:33,710
Okay, he used it
Iike a club,

848
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,305
so why don't you
start with the neck?

849
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:42,411
Oh, my God.

850
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:46,817
I think it actually worked.

851
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:58,162
What do you want now?

852
00:38:58,238 --> 00:39:00,729
Have you talked
to your husband?
Of course I have.

853
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:02,639
So you know what happened.

854
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,075
Tricia seduced him.

855
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,078
She was 11 years old.

856
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:10,980
She was a very disturbed girl.

857
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,541
She wouldn't Ieave him alone.

858
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,644
STABLER: And you believe him?
Yes, I do.

859
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:18,123
Do you also believe
he had nothing to
do with her murder?

860
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,921
There's no doubt in my mind.

861
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:21,017
You're right.

862
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,196
BENSON:
We found a fingerprint on
the bottle that struck Tricia.

863
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:26,732
It wasn't your husband's.

864
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:28,357
See?

865
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:29,629
It was yours.

866
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:35,031
You're wrong.

867
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:40,543
When the school called,
that was the Iast straw,
wasn't it?

868
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:42,241
She'd been in
so much trouble before,

869
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:43,874
you had to find out
what she was up to.

870
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:46,112
So you went Iooking
for her.

871
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:57,755
I thought
it had to be drugs.

872
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:01,961
I went and Iooked in her room.

873
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,003
What did you find?

874
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,570
A slip of paper
by the phone.

875
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:10,776
It had a hotel,
date and time.

876
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:15,146
I knew she was
going to have sex.

877
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:18,342
You went there
to save her?

878
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:21,013
Yes, but I was too Iate.

879
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,313
She was just coming out.

880
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:27,987
You're her mother.
You confronted her.

881
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:39,605
She just walked away.

882
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:43,933
I knew
she'd been with that man,

883
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:45,501
the one
who got her pregnant.

884
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:49,447
So you followed her,
you demanded to know.

885
00:40:51,218 --> 00:40:53,118
She finally told you,
didn't she?

886
00:40:55,522 --> 00:40:57,183
She turned on me.

887
00:40:58,392 --> 00:40:59,689
She said,

888
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:03,961
"You want to know
who the father is?

889
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:06,465
"It's your husband"'

890
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:11,200
That must have
been unbearable.

891
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:15,365
I slapped her.

892
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:21,011
She pushed me back
and I fell.

893
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:26,217
I didn't even know
there was a bottle
on the ground.

894
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:27,685
I must have picked it up.

895
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:31,083
You hit her
with the bottle.

896
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,765
You know, she just...

897
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:43,335
She gave me this Iook,

898
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:48,408
Iike I was the one
who had betrayed her.
