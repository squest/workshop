1
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:25,147
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:28,860
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

3
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,084
In New York City,

4
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:33,651
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:36,598
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:38,254
These are their stories.

7
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:43,235
The perp is Sgt. Frank Foster,
Brooklyn narcotics.

8
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:44,417
His kid ran away.

9
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,035
Her picture turns up
on this Web page.

10
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:48,436
Guy who took it
won't say where she is.

11
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,909
Who's the hostage?

12
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,361
The guy who interviewed
his daughter.

13
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,480
He films street kids
and puts them on the Web.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,075
- Sgt. Foster's state of mind?
- Wants his kid.

15
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:57,659
How many in the room?

16
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,441
Four, plus the taker.
Two are his family.

17
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:03,309
If it was my kid,
I'd probably do the same thing.

18
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:04,938
We all might, Lieutenant.

19
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,556
Ready? We got him
on the monitor.

20
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:09,555
Here you go.

21
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,702
Sgt. Foster...

22
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,286
this is Capt. Donald Cragen,
Special Victims Unit.

23
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,832
Donny?

24
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,835
Frank, don't do this.

25
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,075
My gun is down.

26
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:25,944
I'm not a threat.

27
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:27,457
Coming out.

28
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:39,698
This isn't over until I know
where my daughter is.

29
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:41,674
I want her safe.

30
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:45,074
It's that, or you shoot me now.

31
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:56,288
Thanks, Captain.

32
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:03,850
He slaps me around.

33
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,704
What's he gonna do to his daughter
if he finds her?

34
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:07,362
We want her safe.

35
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:08,940
She didn't feel safe at home.

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,593
She tell you that?

37
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,980
You wanna see what she told me?

38
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:23,357
Mom, like, freaks about lipstick,
like purple's gonna kill me.

39
00:02:23,357 --> 00:02:25,048
Dad's like I don't exist.

40
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:26,683
He said I couldn't find my way...
out of the neighborhood,

41
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:28,419
like I'm stupid or something.

42
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,801
He beat you?

43
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,361
He's like a cop.

44
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:33,995
It sucks at my house.
My parents blow.

45
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,120
She didn't run away for nothing.
She's afraid of him.

46
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,580
Hey, Punk.
What's up, Tito?

47
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:45,540
- Pretty thing.
- Who's that?

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,322
- You need some money?
- Kanick, bad news.

49
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:50,875
Guy who runs raves.
Used to be hookers.

50
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,725
Get high, get down.

51
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:56,043
Rainlight Rave, Saturday.

52
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:58,630
Make $500.

53
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:01,239
Tell us where she is.

54
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:02,556
I don't know.

55
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:05,436
She was hanging with these kids
who hang downtown.

56
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:08,107
This capture's
in the meat-packing district.

57
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:12,193
Your piece, Sergeant.

58
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,338
You're not gonna kick this
over to missing persons.

59
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:18,085
They did nothing.

60
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:22,359
What's the alternative here, Frank?

61
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,874
Cuff him.

76
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:30,392
Have a seat, Captain.

77
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:34,198
You understand this interview
will be recorded?

78
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:35,410
I do.

79
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,931
You're being questioned pursuant to
General Order 15

80
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:41,456
about serious irregularities
in the Foster investigation.

81
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:45,050
Refusal to answer any questions
will result in immediate suspension.

82
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,399
I understand.

83
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,701
Are you waiving your right to have
a union delegate or attorney present?

84
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,861
Yes. I have nothing to hide.

85
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:54,820
Then tell us your version
of what happened.

86
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,483
I was the hostage negotiator
on call that day for the borough.

87
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:02,352
Early afternoon I was notified
that an armed man

88
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:05,735
had taken hostages at the offices
of an Internet magazine.

89
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:08,672
When did you first learn the identity
of the hostage taker?

90
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:09,847
When I got there.

91
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,994
It was Sgt. Frank Foster,
Brooklyn narcotics.

92
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:14,866
You know Sgt. Foster?

93
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,924
For more than 30 years,

94
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:18,858
since we went to
the Academy together.

95
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:20,615
But you already know this, don't you?

96
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:24,774
Is that why you failed to disarm Sgt. Foster
on your first contact with him?

97
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,928
I assessed the situation,

98
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:30,219
believed that he was no threat to
anybody in that room.

99
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:33,640
My assessment was correct.
We disarmed him without incident.

100
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,103
After you allowed him to
return to the room with his weapon.

101
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,887
You violated every rule
of hostage negotiation.

102
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:41,505
I was not about to paint
a bull's-eye on a good cop.

103
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:43,616
Frank Foster acted in the heat
of the moment.

104
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:45,036
His daughter had run away.

105
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,504
He was distraught,
trying to find her.

106
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,042
He was not gonna hurt anybody.

107
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,637
In your opinion,

108
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:52,700
which certainly wasn't objective
in light of your friendship.

109
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,447
You should have
recused yourself.

110
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:56,437
Instead you proceeded on an investigation

111
00:05:56,437 --> 00:05:58,544
that would normally have been
handled by Missing Persons.

112
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:02,623
Jill Foster was an underaged runaway
the daughter of a cop.

113
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:06,103
She was seen in the company
of a convicted sex offender and pimp.

114
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:08,868
That put the case
squarely on our turf.

115
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,437
I reached out to Vice.

116
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,310
They lent me Monique Jeffries,
one of my former detectives.

117
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,476
Another detective on my squad,
Fin Tutuola, went undercover.

118
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,193
And you consider your actions
normal operating procedure?

119
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:21,427
There was nothing normal
about this case.

120
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,158
It was a cop's daughter.

121
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:25,271
What would you have done?

122
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:28,468
Stay away from this guy.

123
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:31,161
We'll start with him.
His name's Lance Kanick.

124
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:33,654
Tito has him as a promoter
of Rainlight Raves.

125
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,570
In '87 he was running
Ooo-Wee Escort Service

126
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,342
providing top-shelf drugs
and call girls to Wall Streeters.

127
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:42,760
Beat one of his girls to death
with a tire iron.

128
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,583
It's in the Crime Scene
Procedures text.

129
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,781
Should have been doing life,

130
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,605
but a rookie contaminated the scene.

131
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,124
Took a plea.
Did seven.

132
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:50,482
He's still dealing.

133
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:53,133
Raves are where you score X,
GHB, ketamines.

134
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,073
Big money for the dealers.

135
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:57,655
X pays off better than
a thousand to one.

136
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:59,253
Well, you know that world.

137
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,461
Munch, Fin, talk to Kanick.

138
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,751
Olivia, Elliot, Tito offered to help.

139
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:05,565
Jeffries, you'll coordinate from here.

140
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:08,634
And, guys, this is more than
just a favor to a fellow cop.

141
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,777
Kanick takes young girls,
turns them into hookers.

142
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:12,290
One hooker into a corpse.

143
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,452
I want Jill Foster off the street
before either happens.

144
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,755
Tito, this is Det. Benson.

145
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:21,346
Heard you wanted to help.

146
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:24,370
Nobody's talking to you
and a mall queen.

147
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,385
What about the black chick?

148
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,447
The black chick has other duties.

149
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:31,362
What's this about?

150
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:35,625
This is how I capture runaway images
without them freaking.

151
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:40,268
Nobody knows I have a camera.

152
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:43,023
Well, I can keep a secret
if the mall queen can.

153
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,789
Rikers Island Visitor's Room
Tuesday, October 24

154
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,242
You okay?

155
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,363
Not gonna be okay till they find Jill.

156
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:02,765
Your union rep called me.
They're trying for ROR.

157
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,995
What difference does it make?
I took hostages.

158
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:06,583
It's over for me.

159
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:08,779
Frank...

160
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:14,213
we're friends.

161
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:17,343
I stood up at your wedding.
Why didn't you call me?

162
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,069
And tell you what?

163
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,523
My daughter had it with her lousy father
and decided to take off?

164
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:24,069
What would you have
thought of me then?

165
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,872
That you need help.

166
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:31,099
Every day I was out there
taking dope off the streets.

167
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,083
Jill was putting it up her nose.

168
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,212
Smoking it, popping pills, whatever.

169
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:38,015
It was like she was intentionally
slapping me in the face.

170
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:41,152
You're not the first cop
whose kid has a drug problem.

171
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:43,013
Maybe not, but...

172
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,505
I did what any parent with his head up
his ass would do.

173
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,276
I made it about me.

174
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,334
How's the narc gonna look
if he can't keep his own kid clean?

175
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:55,840
You saved my ass that night
when we were rookies in East New York.

176
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,368
Waited one second longer,

177
00:08:57,368 --> 00:09:01,046
I'm lying in a box and we're never
having this conversation.

178
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:05,591
You know, you don't
owe me anything.

179
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,974
You got something to ask...

180
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,271
ask it.

181
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:18,048
Did you in any way
abuse your daughter?

182
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:23,200
I never touched her physically.

183
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:26,046
But I didn't respect her, either.

184
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,190
I called her loser junkie.

185
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,808
That's abuse, isn't it?

186
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:36,922
I'll talk to our A.D.A., Alex Cabot.

187
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:39,072
Maybe she can help you.

188
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:45,087
This isn't about me.
It's about Jill.

189
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:48,801
Find her, Donny.

190
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:52,910
Please.

191
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:56,827
Yeah.

192
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:00,852
Stanton Apartments
499 Broome Street
Tuesday, October 24

193
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,064
- Hey, wake up.
- What?

194
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:05,564
Lance Kanick.

195
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,148
He don't live here.

196
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,722
This was his last known address.

197
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:16,398
Look, we got 48 mailboxes...
and 46 apartments.

198
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,766
Kanick rents one of the extras.

199
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,784
When's he pick up his mail?

200
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,928
Guys pick it up for him.

201
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,185
They mention where he lives?

202
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:29,364
All I know is, he drives a big SUV.

203
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:31,039
What's the license plate number?

204
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,733
That's one of my hobbies,
remembering license plates.

205
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,135
You like to try making them?

206
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:41,103
It's a dark green Excursion.
I don't know the plate.

207
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:42,912
He get much mail?

208
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:45,214
See for yourself.

209
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:58,893
Bank statement,
Cayman Islands.

210
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:00,222
Banking in the Caribbean.

211
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:03,320
Not bad, six years out of Ossining.

212
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,117
Have you seen this girl?

213
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:08,138
Yesterday.
I remember the shirt.

214
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:11,240
- Was she with anybody?
- Kids, like those.

215
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:14,231
Cops.

216
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,641
You guys can't help
but announce yourselves, can you?

217
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:22,655
Look at this, an invitation
to Rainlight Raves,

218
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:24,973
tomorrow night at 10:00 p.m
but it doesn't say where.

219
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:26,584
There's an 800 number.

220
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,957
You call the day of the rave.
That's when they tell you where it is.

221
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,001
All right, let's worry about today.

222
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,929
Any of these kids recognize Jill?

223
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:33,033
No, but they know Kanick.

224
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,510
They go to his raves,
roll on his X.

225
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,006
- They can't afford it, they barter.
- Barter what?

226
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:39,863
Sex. What do you think?

227
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:42,921
There's huge money
in barely legal teens.

228
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,808
Hey, Ronnie.

229
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,333
What's up, Tito?

230
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,865
I'm looking for this girl, Jill.

231
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:57,125
She looks like a lot of them.
Anybody seen this girl, Jill?

232
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,898
Hey!

233
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:07,122
All right.

234
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,925
Why did you run?

235
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:16,176
The girl...

236
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,045
I think she's dead.

237
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:26,786
385 W. 19th Street
Tuesday, October 24

238
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,707
Second floor in the rear.

239
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,462
Go.

240
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:47,865
Shooting gallery stench.

241
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:51,104
- This will cover it.
- No.

242
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:31,838
The girl we found
wasn't Sgt. Foster's daughter.

243
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:32,880
Who was she?

244
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,761
Another throwaway kid.

245
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:38,218
Did her death affect the unit's
decision-making process?

246
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,678
If you're asking, "Did we intensify
efforts to find Jill Foster?"

247
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:42,730
The answer is yes.

248
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,516
Your C.O. stated that you,
"Pulled out all the stops."

249
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:47,841
What's your point?

250
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:49,951
Thousands of kids on
the street, Detective.

251
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,686
We can't save them all.

252
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:54,944
Why did Jill Foster merit so much
extra attention?

253
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:57,847
One runaway connected
with Jill was already dead.

254
00:13:57,847 --> 00:13:59,136
We didn't want another.

255
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:00,330
Tell us, Det. Stabler,

256
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,495
is it also your practice to enlist civilians
to gather evidence for your investigations?

257
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:07,052
If you're referring to Tito Frank,
he volunteered.

258
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:08,605
After you recruited him.

259
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:11,963
Tito knew the scene.
His information was reliable.

260
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:14,066
He wanted to help us find Jill.

261
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:17,222
Did you register him
as a confidential informant?

262
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,756
No, but my C.O. knew about it.

263
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:20,553
- Did he clear it with Intel?
- He didn't say.

264
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:22,630
Did Capt. Cragen
give you other orders?

265
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,755
He told us to find Jill Foster,
whatever it takes.

266
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:30,339
Your Jane Doe is approximately 14.

267
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:33,023
OD'd on a pharmaceutical
cocktail particular to raves:

268
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:35,611
Crystal meth, ketamine, and X.

269
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:38,489
I don't usually MRI an autopsy,
but this girl,

270
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:41,597
I wanted a record.
She was abused.

271
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:45,647
Scar tissue her skull
has grown around.

272
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:49,682
Recurring fractures:
Skull, ribs, arms, femur.

273
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,644
When nobody claims her,
I'll pay for a funeral.

274
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,216
She was waxed, Detective.

275
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:56,890
You mean like bikini wax?

276
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,179
I mean, except for scalp
and brow, she was hairless:

277
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:01,606
Arms, legs, and pubis.

278
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,952
Kiddie porn.

279
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,817
There were six kids, and a guy
gave us money to party.

280
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,330
Have sex?

281
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,167
Yeah, for the camera.

282
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,696
Sit down.

283
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:16,547
Describe the man
who gave you money.

284
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:18,864
I can't. It was dark at the rave.

285
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:21,293
Okay. White, black?

286
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:22,729
Black.

287
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:26,069
But a white guy
drove us to the location.

288
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,264
Where you had sex for the camera?

289
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:29,666
Yeah.

290
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,216
Okay. What did the white guy look like?

291
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:35,372
We were dropping X
in the back of the truck,

292
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:37,004
and I didn't see his face.

293
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,683
The adults at the location?

294
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:43,416
We were on the bright side
of the lights,

295
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,513
and I couldn't see.

296
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,609
The dead girl you woke up with?

297
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:52,138
Just one of the girls partying.

298
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:54,369
Look, Will,

299
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:59,315
you're in a lot of trouble
if you can't give us anything else.

300
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:04,187
I mean, I remember a voice.

301
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:06,512
A girl saying,

302
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,602
"Do her. Do him."

303
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,536
He's not much help.

304
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,263
He can't even make an ID.

305
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,963
We've got nothing.

306
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,418
What about the new date-rape
drug law?

307
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:20,213
We could charge the creeps who doped
him with facilitating a sex offense.

308
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,071
If we could find whoever gave him
the drugs or shot the film.

309
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:24,479
Right now I need a perp.

310
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,602
We need Jill Foster.

311
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:30,058
I'd prefer a witness who isn't
a drugged-out street kid.

312
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:33,978
How about we call in
Jill Foster's brother?

313
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:37,154
Did your sister use drugs?

314
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,134
She'd drop X just to
get through dinner tweaked.

315
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,522
I should have said something.

316
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:46,622
Does your sister have
any special interests?

317
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:48,861
Maybe art.

318
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,122
She was failing everything but art.

319
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,506
She ever talk to you
about running away?

320
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:55,020
Yeah.

321
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,243
I thought it would have
been Disney World.

322
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:59,611
She said she wanted to see Dumbo.

323
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,132
Okay, where are we?

324
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,860
We look for Jill in D.U.M.B.O.

325
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,391
- Why the art district?
- She told her brother.

326
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,820
He doesn't know that
D.U.M.B.O.'s an acronym

327
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,399
for Down Under
the Manhattan Bridge Overpass.

328
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,818
He's thinking the cartoon.

329
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:15,738
Yeah, and what about
our Jane Doe?

330
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:17,099
An overdose.

331
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,749
Jane Doe has a name,
Gina Lang from D.C.

332
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:21,472
Yeah? Have you notified her parents?

333
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:22,311
Yeah.

334
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:25,475
They're very concerned by the cost of
shipping the body.

335
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:27,752
Have we tied Kanick
to any of this?

336
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:29,567
- We can't find him.
- Why not?

337
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,300
No residence. No license.

338
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,332
Third parties pick up mail.
He banks offshore.

339
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:34,583
He's invisible and mobile.

340
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,005
Green Excursion,
registration unknown.

341
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:39,573
Circumstance ties him
to Rainlight Productions.

342
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:43,772
It's a licensed corporation promoting
non-alcoholic events, raves.

343
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:48,267
The attorney of record
is a Ted Bolger.

344
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,839
Bolger cut Kanick's plea
on the hooker murder.

345
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,163
Thirteen years ago,
nice to see they stay in touch.

346
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:55,943
But the scum specializes
in prostitutes and pimps.

347
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:58,083
Now he's filing corporate papers?

348
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,376
Benson, Stabler, to D.U.M.B.O.

349
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:03,279
Munch, Tutuola, take Bolger.

350
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:07,485
Office of Ted Bolger
310 W. 36th Street
Wednesday, October 25

351
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,955
Who the hell are you?

352
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,731
Shut up and sit down.

353
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:15,315
Get out of my office.

354
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,730
I ain't going anywhere.

355
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,282
- I'll call the police.
- For what?

356
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:20,517
So you can show them
all your cocaine?

357
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:28,696
What's your rate, man?

358
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:34,047
Who are you?

359
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,970
What's your rate?
I need the privilege.

360
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,287
It's six bills an hour.

361
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,451
I got some business.

362
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:50,401
- Fin?
- Yeah, Fin.

363
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:55,453
Okay, Fin.

364
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,554
You just bought yourself an hour.

365
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:01,004
So you're my lawyer?

366
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:03,007
For the next 59 minutes.

367
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,331
So everything I say
has the privilege?

368
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:07,381
I take it to my grave.

369
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:10,807
Lance Kanick, where is he?

370
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:12,150
I haven't seen him.

371
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,219
He promotes Rainlight Raves.
You're Rainlight's lawyer.

372
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:16,282
Who is he?

373
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:18,769
That's my Jew.
Where's Kanick?

374
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:22,088
I got some young ladies
who wanna work for him.

375
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,271
Okay, Fin.

376
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:40,265
Okay, that is his cell phone.

377
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:44,593
His line of work, it's better
I don't know where he is,

378
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,450
you understand?

379
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,777
And you didn't get that from me.

380
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:53,680
I understand you owe me
55 more minutes.

381
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,675
Shalom.

382
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:01,880
Last four digits, 5060.

383
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,784
Your Jew? What if I
called you my boy?

384
00:20:04,784 --> 00:20:06,530
I'll be your boy, John.

385
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,767
This is not funny.
We're not in Narcotics, you cowboy.

386
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,258
Fast and loose doesn't play here.

387
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:11,963
Look, we got his cell phone number,
we got him.

388
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,734
And I got a small ventricular
rupture pulled out of me with no warning.

389
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,253
What's the matter with you?

390
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,669
Flea Market D.U.M.B.O
Wednesday, October 25

391
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,952
I love that t-shirt.

392
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:24,347
I wanted to trade her,
but she wouldn't give it up.

393
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:25,645
When was that?

394
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:28,753
Two hours ago
with those candy kids.

395
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:30,469
"Candy kids?"

396
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:32,422
Fuzzy clothes, plastic jewelry.

397
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:35,166
They went to Lorna Frankel's loft.
All the kids hang there.

398
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,890
It's at Johns and Gold.

399
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,577
Look for the big pig.

400
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:40,061
Who's Lorna Frankel?

401
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:44,664
Think Salvador Dali's feminine side,
and then give it fangs.

402
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:45,940
Right.

403
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:58,908
What's up, man?

404
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,884
When I asked the agency
for men that defined the city

405
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:12,732
did they think
I was referring to Orlando?

406
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:14,755
Are you Lorna Frankel?

407
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:16,142
So far.

408
00:21:16,468 --> 00:21:18,604
So take your clothes off,

409
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:21,738
and arrange yourself on this sofa

410
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,982
and I'll make something of it.

411
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,737
Who are these kids?

412
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,029
Don't know.

413
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:30,935
They wander in.

414
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:33,268
She wander in, Jill Foster?

415
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,604
Well, if she did,
she'd be here.

416
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:37,821
You see her?

417
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:39,972
He's not stealing is he?

418
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:42,418
She left an hour ago.

419
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:43,786
What's the quickest way to find her?

420
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:45,834
Do I look like Missing Persons?

421
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:49,351
Maybe I should check.
Hey, get up! Party's over.

422
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,600
Get up.

423
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,219
A'right, I'm the police.
Show me some ID.

424
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:54,622
They haven't done anything.

425
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:56,101
This is a free country.

426
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,878
No, it's a democracy,

427
00:21:57,878 --> 00:22:00,490
and the majority of us do not
like what's going on here.

428
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,297
Come on, empty your pockets.
Put it down here.

429
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:03,698
You know the routine.

430
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,970
Do what they say, but don't
tell them anything.

431
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,312
License, registration?

432
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:13,281
Truck's leased to
Rainlight Promotions.

433
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:14,949
Driver's clean.

434
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:17,073
Lance Kanick...

435
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,468
step out of the car.

436
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:21,635
We tracked you
by your cell phone.

437
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:26,073
Where do you live?

438
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,818
If you can't tell us,
we can provide you with an address.

439
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,958
I'm at the Biltmore.

440
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:36,566
Jill Foster's been seen
in your company.

441
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,447
She's a minor. Where is she?

442
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:40,268
She the Mayor's daughter?

443
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:43,631
She's the child of a police officer.

444
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,096
There are 39,000 of us.

445
00:22:49,096 --> 00:22:50,376
Anything happens to Jill,

446
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:52,757
we're all gonna be looking
for a piece of you.

447
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:58,746
You run into Jill,
you'll call us.

448
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:00,324
I hear you.

449
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,990
Hello, Mr. Police.

450
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:10,081
Come on, in here.

451
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:12,162
Hey, guys.

452
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:13,884
Ask my partner.

453
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:15,588
Monique, would you...

454
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:16,785
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

455
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,643
You two, come on, let's go.

456
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:20,544
Keep it down.
Just walk straight ahead.

457
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:22,551
This is not a club. Come on.

458
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:25,491
You couldn't question them
where you found them?

459
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:28,123
They were taking cues
from Lorna Frankel.

460
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:29,724
Well, who's that?

461
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,743
D.U.M.B.O. artist.
They were in her loft.

462
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,243
And kids like these, fear motivates.

463
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:36,448
Fin's good at that, fear.

464
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,635
So what do you think
you'll scare out of these kids?

465
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:39,753
Where Jill is.

466
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,427
On the way over here we got a rave
she should be at tonight.

467
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:43,419
You blew it.

468
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:45,812
Now word will get out on the street
that we're looking for Jill.

469
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:48,425
Heads up, Bolger.

470
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:54,653
Fin role-played Bolger to buy him
as a Miami gangster.

471
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:56,860
Undercover without clearance?

472
00:23:58,357 --> 00:23:59,892
Nobody said anything?

473
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:03,720
It doesn't matter,
cause it's not admissible. / That's right.

474
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,412
I'm Ted Bolger.
I'll be your attorney. Okay?

475
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,093
Juveniles with a $500-an-hour
mouthpiece.

476
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:12,706
There goes your motivational fear.

477
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:14,483
How did he get here so fast?

478
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:16,764
Frankel's connected to Kanick.

479
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,539
Monique, Tito.

480
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:20,628
Frankel and Kanick share a lawyer.

481
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,574
If Kanick finds out
you're helping us...

482
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:24,174
He'll kill me.

483
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:25,828
You have a place to lay low?

484
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:26,722
Yeah.

485
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:29,745
All right, we need some background
information on a D.U.M.B.O. artist

486
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:30,999
- name of...
- Lorna Frankel.

487
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:34,334
Right. Now, these kids have to be
released now.

488
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:35,928
Wait here.

489
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:43,167
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.

490
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,433
You enter uninvited a private home

491
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,052
and without cause,
intimidate my clients.

492
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:50,372
And then you haul them
in here for questioning. / That's it.

493
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:52,508
- That's exactly what happened.
- We're trying to find a missing minor.

494
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:55,626
I don't care if you're looking
for Osama bin Laden.

495
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:57,771
This is still America,

496
00:24:57,771 --> 00:24:59,198
right, kids?

497
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,628
Come on, let's get out of here.

498
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:02,974
- Come on.
- That's my lawyer right there.

499
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:07,248
John.

500
00:25:14,452 --> 00:25:16,714
John, what the hell
were you thinking?

501
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:19,228
A good cop's in prison,
his daughter was mixed up with scum,

502
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,487
and you and Fin are out of control.

503
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,383
If this compromises my investigation,

504
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:26,323
I'm holding both of you
personally responsible.

505
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:37,470
Who authorized
the undercover operation?

506
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,931
- At the rave?
- Yes.

507
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:43,525
I don't know who authorized it.
I was just told to do it.

508
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,002
By whom?

509
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:46,843
By my captain.

510
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,968
But he would have never
approved the operation

511
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:52,502
without going through
the proper channels.

512
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:54,189
Det. Benson,

513
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:56,214
are you trying to cover for him?

514
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:59,004
Are you trying to jam up my boss?

515
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:03,591
We're simply attempting to ascertain
who authorized the undercover operation.

516
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:06,777
You'll have to ask the Captain.
He did not share that information with me.

517
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:10,254
And what about a tactical plan?
Did he share that with you?

518
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:12,372
Yes. / Were all contingencies
covered?

519
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,468
Absolutely they were covered.

520
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:16,942
We had backup. We were
in constant communication.

521
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,651
You didn't cover
all your bases, did you?

522
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,573
If you're implying
that we screwed up,

523
00:26:20,573 --> 00:26:21,570
you're off base.

524
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,491
We're suggesting that
your plan was flawed.

525
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:30,723
Some things you can't foresee.

526
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:50,414
Do you wanna try some of these?

527
00:26:51,382 --> 00:26:54,823
Fin was right. This place is
an open market for drugs.

528
00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:02,776
Did you tell Tito to lay low?

529
00:27:02,776 --> 00:27:04,484
Yeah, well, he's here.

530
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,800
- Security's got an eye on him.
- Check him out.

531
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,682
Yeah.

532
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:21,810
Hey, Tito. Lay low mean
anything to you?

533
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,427
I take care of myself.

534
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:42,348
Jill!

535
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:44,258
Cops! Everybody out!

536
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:47,354
Take your hands off me.

537
00:27:47,354 --> 00:27:48,982
Let me go. Someone help me!

538
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,008
Let go of me!

539
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:53,319
I need backup,
back room on the right.

540
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,288
Follow the strobe.

541
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:57,518
Police, break it up.
Get your hands off her guys.

542
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:03,660
Jill!

543
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:09,726
Get your hands off her.
Get against the wall now.

544
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:12,052
Okay.

545
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,754
16th Precinct Interrogation Room
Friday, October 27

546
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:23,030
I'm Alex Cabot,
D.A.'s office.

547
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,973
I want my phone call.
It's been 12 hours.

548
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:30,530
Right.

549
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,795
You're lawyer's Ted Bolger?

550
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,852
Yeah.

551
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:36,635
From your loft,

552
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:38,683
images of minors engaged in sex.

553
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,807
And a wax strip
with Gina Lang's DNA.

554
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,768
A 14-year-old who died

555
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:46,926
after engaging in sex
at your direction on this tape.

556
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:47,836
Your rap sheet.

557
00:28:47,836 --> 00:28:50,848
In '79 you were porn princess
Layla Cream Cheese?

558
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:55,390
Between '83 and '87 you were arrested
as call girl, Louise Francis.

559
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,985
Because of prior bad acts,

560
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,694
I'm seeking for each count
of minors performing sex

561
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:02,360
consecutive sentences
of seven years.

562
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,379
For the death of Gina Lang,
the man two, max of 15.

563
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,793
Seven hundred and fifteen years.

564
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:09,104
You need to call a lawyer.

565
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:12,694
A Rainlight Productions check made out
to you signed by Lance Kanick.

566
00:29:12,694 --> 00:29:15,924
Bolger is Kanick's lawyer.
Bolger is Rainlight's lawyer.

567
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:18,459
Bolger was the lawyer for
Ooo-Wee Escorts and Kanick

568
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,701
when he murdered
one of Ooo-Wee's call girls.

569
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:22,187
You remember?

570
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:24,810
Yeah, Wendy.

571
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:28,915
Both Bolger and Kanick benefit
from illegal enterprises,

572
00:29:28,915 --> 00:29:31,866
to which we can only tie you.

573
00:29:33,131 --> 00:29:35,631
You need to call a lawyer.

574
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,363
There's something you'll do for me?

575
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:42,502
I think Bolger's more than a lawyer.

576
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:43,992
I think he's a partner.

577
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,272
You make that connection stick,

578
00:29:45,272 --> 00:29:47,867
you'll be out of jail
before menopause.

579
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:56,158
Bolger's just a lawyer I was supposed
to call when this happens.

580
00:29:56,158 --> 00:29:58,505
So if you got all
of the tapes out of my loft,

581
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,414
you've got Kanick.

582
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:02,619
A couple of times when he was
coaching a few of the kids

583
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:04,921
I turned the camera around.

584
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:06,936
It's dark, but it's there.

585
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:11,125
He's feeding them drugs
and other things.

586
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:20,064
You page Tito?

587
00:30:20,064 --> 00:30:22,017
Yeah, three times.
He finally calling in?

588
00:30:22,017 --> 00:30:23,779
Homicide is.

589
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:28,406
Excuse me.

590
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:29,610
Excuse me!

591
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:32,631
Ed. / Elliot.

592
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,844
Beeper went off,
recognized the number.

593
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:36,537
Why were you paging him?

594
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:38,203
- You mind?
- Go ahead.

595
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,757
Looking for a runaway...

596
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:46,587
he was helping us out.

597
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:07,913
My dad's in jail?

598
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:10,948
This is my fault.

599
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:13,081
- You can fix it.
- No, I can't.

600
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,878
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

601
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,738
What I did tonight...

602
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:20,198
What?

603
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,119
That rave you pulled me out of,

604
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,565
I had to roll
and I didn't have the money...

605
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:29,415
You rolling now?

606
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:31,369
A little.

607
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:36,635
All I had to do was take pictures.
Now my dad will see them.

608
00:31:36,635 --> 00:31:38,707
No, the cops have them.

609
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:40,675
My dad's a cop.

610
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:42,797
They'll show him.

611
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,861
They're my friends.

612
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,150
Your dad will never see them,
I promise.

613
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:51,179
Your family's dying to see you.

614
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,788
I can't.

615
00:31:53,335 --> 00:31:54,923
I can't.

616
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:56,918
Where you gonna stay?

617
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:58,584
I got a place.

618
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:01,435
It's creepy,
but it gets me a roof.

619
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,060
Bring the cops down on my rave.

620
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,499
You brought this on yourself.

621
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:22,765
Tito?

622
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,561
Tito?

623
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:29,514
Cold yet?

624
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,599
I'm willing to speak to you.

625
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:53,560
However, you have no legal authority
to compel me to answer any questions.

626
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,780
We are well aware of that, Ms. Cabot.

627
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,047
We're only trying to get to the truth.

628
00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:59,550
Aren't we all?

629
00:32:59,774 --> 00:33:02,696
After Tito Frank was murdered
by Lance Kanick,

630
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:04,957
how would you describe
morale on the unit?

631
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:06,923
Everyone was understandably upset

632
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:08,822
and eager to apprehend
Mr. Kanick.

633
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:12,550
What would you say was Capt. Cragen's
state of mind at that point?

634
00:33:13,015 --> 00:33:16,032
I would never speculate
about another person's state of mind.

635
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,250
Ask him yourself.

636
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,416
Do you agree that Capt. Cragen's
personal friendship with Jill Foster's father

637
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,173
caused him to place undue pressure
on you to cut a deal with Kanick?

638
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:28,204
Capt. Cragen made his opinions clear.

639
00:33:29,135 --> 00:33:32,386
But if you're positing I cannot
act independently, then you're wrong.

640
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:37,164
Would you agree, nevertheless
that the investigation was handled poorly?

641
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,857
The Special Victims Unit acted
in a completely professional manner.

642
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:42,834
An informant was brutally murdered.

643
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,515
Certainly you have
an opinion about that.

644
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:49,085
If you are looking for someone
to denigrate Capt. Cragen or the unit

645
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:51,062
find someone else.

646
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:02,080
That chair.

647
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:04,091
I want my lawyer.

648
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,737
We do, too.

649
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:19,405
It'll take eight years
to exhaust his appeals.

650
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:23,154
He'll spend all of that time alone in a cell
half the size of this room.

651
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:25,206
A call will be made to
the Governor's home an hour

652
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:27,067
before the execution.

653
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:29,807
Some bleeding heart with
a desperate plea for his life.

654
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:32,054
I intend to answer that call.

655
00:34:36,528 --> 00:34:38,291
What can you do for me?

656
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,785
I can't talk to you
since you requested a lawyer.

657
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:42,957
Forget all of that.
Talk to me.

658
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:45,253
- You waiving your Miranda rights?
- Hell, yes.

659
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:47,274
What can you do for me?

660
00:34:47,592 --> 00:34:50,678
Give me evidence that Bolger is
your partner not just your lawyer,

661
00:34:50,678 --> 00:34:54,097
and I will acquiesce
to life without parole.

662
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:59,576
Man one, fifteen. You get
Bolger and that girl you're looking for.

663
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:01,135
No deal.

664
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:03,473
No girl.

665
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,617
Lethal injection.

666
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:07,824
Heroin addiction.

667
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,998
There is one offer
on the table, that's it.

668
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:17,435
A cop's kid, too.

669
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:20,326
I thought you all went the extra mile
for one of your own.

670
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,165
It's my deal or the death penalty.

671
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,161
You've got 10 minutes.

672
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:32,128
This is a cop's child.

673
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:34,168
What else matters?

674
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,366
The D.A.'s office
has made worse deals.

675
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:39,710
We see murderers
out on the street in less time

676
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,284
for reasons with a lot less
validity every day.

677
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:44,994
We have to stomach that every day.

678
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:48,368
It's not just the people
in this room, Alex.

679
00:35:48,368 --> 00:35:51,064
Everybody in blue knows
about the Foster case.

680
00:35:51,064 --> 00:35:52,771
This is in the family.

681
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:55,399
- Kanick will murder again.
- So you're murdering now.

682
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:57,543
How's that supposed to settle
with the grunts?

683
00:35:57,543 --> 00:35:59,411
- What are you saying?
- What he's saying is,

684
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:02,771
it's harder to do our jobs
if we've lost faith in the D.A.'s office.

685
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:04,459
Are you threatening me?

686
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:05,921
It's a blanket statement.

687
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:08,846
Offer him 20 years.
He'll be 60 by the time he gets out.

688
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:10,923
I'm not putting that animal
back on the streets.

689
00:36:10,923 --> 00:36:13,720
He killed with a tire iron,
with a gun. No remorse.

690
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,428
He gets out in 20 years,
he'll be killing with something else...

691
00:36:16,428 --> 00:36:18,437
murdering someone else.

692
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:20,723
Alex, we can save a life today.

693
00:36:20,723 --> 00:36:23,695
Not prevent some hypothetical
murder 20 years down the road.

694
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:26,879
There's a girl out there
that needs our help now.

695
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,011
- He ain't giving it up.
- I know.

696
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:33,184
We can get it out of him.

697
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:34,499
We don't do that here.

698
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:37,208
I heard the speech.
And I'll listen to it, but not today.

699
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,440
Kanick won't deal,
so don't ask me to do that.

700
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,474
Cabot's right.
Kanick shouldn't get out.

701
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:43,722
So some little girl goes
down the tubes?

702
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:45,649
Look, in my way we can
get both jobs done.

703
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:47,851
I don't do that anymore.
I'm old and it's tiring.

704
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:49,724
- I'll do the heavy lifting.
- It's not the heavy lifting.

705
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:52,585
Everything you do comes back at you,
blows to the soul.

706
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,318
It's the metaphysical heavy lifting
I can't do anymore.

707
00:36:55,318 --> 00:36:56,996
I can work this one alone.

708
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:58,892
I don't wanna know about it.

709
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:01,995
Forest on Central.

710
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:06,402
Fin. Keys. I'll drive.

711
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,025
I got him.
Give him here.

712
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:26,962
In the car on the way to Central Booking,

713
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:30,237
Mr. Kanick volunteered
where we could find Jill Foster.

714
00:37:30,237 --> 00:37:33,041
Volunteered after you tuned him up
is what you mean,

715
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,333
isn't it, Detective?

716
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,170
Other than hitting his head
on the roof of the car

717
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,694
when we put him in, no one
laid a hand on Mr. Kanick.

718
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:40,830
That's not the information we have.

719
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,804
Information from who, him?

720
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:45,888
I got the Combat Cross.
I got a file full of commendations.

721
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,858
That does not give you the right
to beat information out of a suspect.

722
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:49,959
He's a liar.

723
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,348
We have a complaint of brutality.

724
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:53,193
Who are you gonna believe,
me or that piece of garbage?

725
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:55,238
You tell us who should we believe.

726
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:14,472
Kanick gave us what we needed.

727
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,353
Yeah, tell Cabot
she can get her warrant.

728
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:23,262
When I worked Narcotics
nobody counted.

729
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:25,423
One drug dealer rips off
another drug dealer.

730
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:27,476
There were no good guys.

731
00:38:27,476 --> 00:38:30,437
When I came over to SVU,
it was different.

732
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,914
They got real victims, okay?

733
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:35,573
Innocents like Jill Foster.

734
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:39,262
She didn't ask to do porno.
She was forced to.

735
00:38:51,523 --> 00:38:55,724
Jill, are you in here?

736
00:38:59,836 --> 00:39:02,867
Jill, we're detectives.
We wanna help you.

737
00:39:03,649 --> 00:39:06,511
Jill, it's okay.

738
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:10,750
Elliot.

739
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:15,194
Oh, God.

740
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,568
This is Det. Benson from SVU unit.

741
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,816
We need to rush a bus to Avenue
D and 3rd Street.

742
00:39:25,816 --> 00:39:27,902
Avenue D and 3rd Street.

743
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:30,012
- Olivia.
- We have a 16-year-old female...

744
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:34,295
Forget it. There's no pulse.

745
00:39:42,116 --> 00:39:45,692
And I do whatever I gotta do
to save a kid from a perv like Kanick.

746
00:39:45,692 --> 00:39:47,071
You kicked the crap out of him!

747
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:49,828
Jill Foster's dead
on account of Kanick!

748
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:55,836
I want my union delegate.

749
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,204
He's here.

750
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:13,153
Want me to go with you?

751
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,773
No.

752
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:49,064
We didn't get the information
fast enough from Kanick

753
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:52,050
to prevent Jill Foster's death.

754
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,180
Capt. Cragen,

755
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,550
we have grave concerns
about the actions of your detectives

756
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,835
that at least one of them
used excessive force with a suspect

757
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:02,536
and that a confidential
informant was improperly used

758
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:05,128
and actually mishandled,
leading to his death.

759
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:08,149
All these allegations
still remain unsubstantiated.

760
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:12,010
That's not gonna stop you from making
an example of someone, is it?

761
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,890
I take full responsibility for the actions
of the detectives under my command.

762
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,413
We believe your failure
to supervise warrants a five-day rip.

763
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:21,677
You wanna dock me
five days of vacation, fine.

764
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:24,016
You really think
that's gonna change anything?

765
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:26,824
Not this time,
but hopefully the next.

766
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,078
A girl OD'd and died alone.

767
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:36,554
Her father, a decorated cop
30-year career over,

768
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:38,161
no pension.

769
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:41,063
His family in shambles.

770
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:45,305
But you know what really,
really scares me?

771
00:41:45,558 --> 00:41:47,415
That all you people are
concerned about is

772
00:41:47,415 --> 00:41:51,057
some lying murdering sack of crap.

773
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:52,741
In this country that lying,

774
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:56,069
murdering sack of crap
has rights, too, Captain.

775
00:41:56,069 --> 00:42:00,071
Tito. Jill Foster.

776
00:42:00,462 --> 00:42:02,492
They're both dead.

777
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:05,113
What about their rights?

778
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:09,142
