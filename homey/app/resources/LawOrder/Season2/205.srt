1
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,049
In the criminal
justice system...

2
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,786
sexually-based offenses

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,555
are considered
especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,057
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

5
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,928
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

6
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,694
are members of an elite squad

7
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,497
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

8
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,332
These are their stories.

9
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,415
Let go, it's mine.

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,646
Okay, now it's mine.

11
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,621
Hey, boys, here you go.

12
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,284
Come on, man,
let's go.

13
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,593
Play nice.
Hey, Mama.

14
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,665
Get away from here. Right now.

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,635
What, bitch?
I think you need to chill.

16
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:11,692
Charlie, can you send...

17
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,672
Help!

18
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,340
God, please, somebody help!

19
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,950
Oh, Jesus!

20
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:32,014
Come here. Help!
Somebody, please!

21
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,425
Help me! Help!

22
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,630
What?

23
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,973
There was a shooting
at P.S. 387 in East Harlem...

24
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,566
six year old girl,
died at the scene.

25
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,768
They're bringing
the shooter up now.

26
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,910
Why did we catch it?

27
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,347
Brass thinks we're
better equipped to handle him.

28
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,408
Good. Bring on the pervert.

29
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,379
Does that look like
a cold-blooded killer to you?

30
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,689
Where are we on the parents?

31
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,658
Both of them called in sick today.
Nobody knows how to find them.

32
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,160
Well, that fills in
a few blanks for me.

33
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,423
Can you even charge
a 7-year-old with murder?

34
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,399
Technically, he just made
the cutoff. Det. Benson?

35
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,593
Yes.

36
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,263
You left a message. Our son,
Elias, was involved in a shooting?

37
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,000
They gave this address,
not a hospital, is he...

38
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,564
Oh, God!
Please say he's alive.

39
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,406
Mrs. Barrera, I'm sorry
about the misunderstanding.

40
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,275
Elias wasn't the one
who was shot.

41
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,373
Oh, thank God.
He was the shooter.

42
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,508
What?

43
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,884
Sir, do you own a gun?
No.

44
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,753
Does your son have access
to one? I don't know how.

45
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,883
He's either at home, school,
or his sitter's.

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,724
And who's that?
Mrs. Strada. Where's our son?

47
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,390
We want to talk
to him with you.

48
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,456
But we can't do that
without your permission.

49
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,161
If you would sign
a Miranda waiver...

50
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,534
Fine. That's fine.
Just let us see him.

51
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,630
Okay, come with me please.

52
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,806
You run them through
License Division?

53
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,472
He had no guns registered.

54
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,881
Of course, the serial number
was filed off the gun he used.

55
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,216
Punched them in the system, clean
sheets. No arrests, no warrant.

56
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,222
We were at the emergency room
all morning.

57
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,417
My baby girl was born
with a respiratory problem.

58
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,323
We had to leave her
at the hospital.

59
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,488
Why don't you
take a seat here. Elias?

60
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,943
It's okay. All right.

61
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,213
Elias, why don't we
have you sit right here.

62
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,940
Hi, Elias, I'm Elliot.
How are you doing?

63
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,610
We're going to talk today,
is that okay?

64
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,883
Do you like school?

65
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,218
What grade are you in?
Second.

66
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,193
Second. That's a good grade.
I like second grade.

67
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,327
What's your favorite subject?

68
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,662
Okay. We're going to talk a little
bit about what happened today. Okay?

69
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,264
Do you know Carly Jackson?

70
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,765
Yeah?

71
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,069
What can you tell me
about Carly?

72
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,406
She's a girl.

73
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,508
Yeah.

74
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,207
Yeah.

75
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,545
You like Carly?

76
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,652
No? How come?

77
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,518
She's always bothering me.

78
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,659
How does she bother you?

79
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,330
She chases me.

80
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,261
She tries to kiss me.

81
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,962
Okay.

82
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,336
Can you tell me what happened
to Carly at recess?

83
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,679
She fell down.

84
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,250
What made her fall down?

85
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,786
The gun.

86
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,595
The gun. Okay.

87
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,831
Who's holding the gun?

88
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,895
Is Carly going to be okay?

89
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,205
Elias, tell me
who had the gun.

90
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,244
I did.

91
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,080
You know what, I think we should
get a lawyer before we go on.

92
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:35,116
Okay, sir. That's fine. You get a
lawyer. We got a phone out there.

93
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,855
He has to stay with us, okay.

94
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,487
Get Fin.

95
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,294
Check out friends, family,
neighbors, school...

96
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,426
anyone he could have
got that gun from.

97
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,670
As slipshod as the screening process
is, I doubt he bought it himself.

98
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,475
Watch it. Watch your back.
Come on.

99
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,794
Elias and Carly fight a lot?

100
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,126
Neither had been sent
to my office.

101
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,466
Where were you when it
happened? Over there.

102
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,432
I ran to her, called for help,
and then I saw Elias.

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,598
Where exactly?

104
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,570
Putting the gun
in the garbage can.

105
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,942
Elias said that Carly
picked on him.

106
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,152
Carly was the sweetest
little girl.

107
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,655
Did we miss something?

108
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,695
He wasn't a troublemaker.
He didn't even talk in line.

109
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,192
He's always been an angel.
What made Elias do this?

110
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,804
That's what we're
trying to find out.

111
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,934
Mrs. Strada, do you keep
a gun here on the premises?

112
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,302
Please.

113
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,371
The kids you watch, could any
of them have brought one in here?

114
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,041
Absolutely not.

115
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,984
You wouldn't happen to have a phone
list for the parents, would you?

116
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,284
Of course I do. Work and home.

117
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,283
By the phone desk over there.

118
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,656
Yeah, we'll need
a copy of that.

119
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,558
Rudy, it's Buddy's turn.

120
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,439
Ma'am, are you responsible
for every kid around here?

121
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,275
Yes. They don't talk
to strangers...

122
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,105
they don't leave the courtyard
without an adult.

123
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,875
I take my job very seriously,
young man.

124
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,910
Okay, Sammy,
where did Elias get the gun?

125
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,909
From his pants.

126
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,115
Before that?
I don't know.

127
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,351
Did he ever talk about having a gun? No.

128
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,053
When's the first time
you saw the gun?

129
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,559
When he shot Carly.

130
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,890
Why did Elias shoot Carly?

131
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,026
I don't know.

132
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,695
She pick on him a lot?

133
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,835
She kissed him all the time.

134
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,306
What would he do
when she kissed him?

135
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,438
His face would get all red.

136
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,607
Did she try
to kiss him that day?

137
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,984
She was walking over.

138
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,281
Cabot's hell bent
on charging the parents.

139
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,483
Parental responsibility. It's a
hot-button issue. That's all it is.

140
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,117
Well, we've got
no ammunition for her.

141
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,683
Nothing about this
makes sense.

142
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,491
Child homicides never do.

143
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,298
What happened to that little boy
to make him want to take a life?

144
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,995
Elliot, you're searching for
a way to make him a victim.

145
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,766
The only victim here
is a dead little girl.

146
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,708
Hi, can we help you?

147
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,143
Yes, I'm Sonia Paredes,
Elias Barrera's teacher.

148
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,580
The limit for class size is supposed
to be 32 students. I have 40.

149
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,848
It must make it kind of hard to give
each student the attention they need.

150
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,286
Impossible.

151
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,717
I was in the teachers' lounge
when they told us.

152
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,089
When they said it was Elias,
I got physically ill.

153
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,232
Mrs. Paredes, is there something
that you want to show us?

154
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,029
After 20 years of teaching,
nothing shocks you anymore.

155
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,228
I wish this had.

156
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,274
When did he draw this?

157
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,977
Yesterday.

158
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,480
Carly had a ponytail.

159
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,018
Charge the boy.
With what?

160
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,613
Murder.
He's seven.

161
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,352
Yes, and if he were six, I would
send him home with his parents...

162
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,484
as the law mandates.

163
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,156
But he's not. The law is
not interpretive, Counselor.

164
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,290
It is to be
very narrowly construed.

165
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,097
He can be charged. He can,
but you know as well as I do...

166
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,137
that the youngest
they've ever convicted was 11.

167
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,604
Yes, but that was
pre-Columbine.

168
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,300
Since then, there's been
an epidemic...

169
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,070
of ever younger kids
killing kids...

170
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,373
with no consequence.
People are fed up with it.

171
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,845
And you're bored of being
the Chief Assistant DA.

172
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,939
I know you're looking
to replace Lewin next fall...

173
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,009
but let me tell you, if you think
you could put a little boy in jail...

174
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,886
just so you can prove you're tough
on crime, you've got to be kidding.

175
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,956
He's old enough to know the
difference between right and wrong.

176
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,629
But not to understand the
consequences of his actions.

177
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:09,134
He brought a gun to school.
He knew what he was doing.

178
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,598
And this,
that gives us intent.

179
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,166
Why don't you just apply
for a change of venue...

180
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,039
to Texas so we can
have him executed?

181
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,738
No, Manhattan Family Court
will be sufficient.

182
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,949
Ms. Cabot,
am I reading this right...

183
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,985
you're charging
a 7-year-old with murder?

184
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,543
Yes, Your Honor.

185
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,748
Surely there's an alternative.

186
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,984
One has yet to present itself.

187
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,322
The commission of the crime by
the respondent is undisputed.

188
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,796
And evidence supporting criminal
intent has just come to light.

189
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,232
How does the minor plead?
General denial, Your Honor.

190
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,929
Remand recommendations?

191
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,667
The People have not ruled out the minor's
home situation as a contributing factor.

192
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,175
We therefore ask for the removal
of the minor from his home...

193
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,336
and ask that he be remanded
to a detention facility...

194
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,470
pending trial.

195
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,710
Your Honor, the Barreras are a
loving, law-abiding, nuclear family.

196
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,648
Elias should be released
into their custody.

197
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,311
The Barreras have ties
outside the country.

198
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,446
Flight risk is a significant
issue with the People...

199
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,013
and the victim's family
who is here today.

200
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:10,022
I'm ordering the minor be remanded
to the Wagner Detention Facility.

201
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,595
I'm further ordering
a clinical evaluation...

202
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,896
to determine whether or not he
understands the charges against him...

203
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,697
and can help
in his own defense.

204
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,470
No! Please, don't take my baby. Mommy!

205
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,906
Oh, please!

206
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,357
Olivia, can you believe
they ran this picture?

207
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,326
Already a couple of hundred people
hanging outside the courthouse.

208
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,228
Who'd have guessed
there'd be backlash...

209
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,824
against charging a 7-year-old
with murder?

210
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:53,895
Amnesty International, Children's
Defense Fund. Alex Cabot.

211
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,908
I didn't want to charge him with
murder. I didn't have any choice.

212
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,036
Now that you've got him in
the big house, is he spilling?

213
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,636
Why he did it?
Where he got the gun?

214
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,774
No, he's completely withdrawn. He
won't even talk to the social worker.

215
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,184
How about spending less time on the kid
we caught, more on the adult we didn't.

216
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,221
What did we send
License Division?

217
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,384
The names of parents of the
other kids Mrs. Strada watches.

218
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,861
Really? Well, guess
what Reyna McCreary owns?

219
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,258
He did not get that gun
from my son.

220
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,800
The gun registered in your name
is still in your possession?

221
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,302
Yes, it is. You mind
if we take a peek at it?

222
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,668
Yes, I do.

223
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,741
There. You satisfied?
Put the gun down on the table.

224
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,446
You carry that around
in your purse?

225
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,847
You know, sometimes I don't
leave the hospital till 3:00 a. m.

226
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,681
I have to take a subway,
a bus...

227
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,153
and walk four blocks through
this neighborhood to get home.

228
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,656
You know, carrying a
concealed weapon is a felony.

229
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,955
I don't. I leave it here so the
appliances can defend themselves.

230
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,088
You have a child living here. You
have a safe place to store this gun?

231
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,756
Of course I do.

232
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,890
Raphael. Get a move on.

233
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,663
We're leaving in 10 seconds.
Coming.

234
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,066
What's up? Raphael, right?

235
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,334
Yeah.
You know Elias?

236
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,838
Yeah.

237
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,504
You heard about what happened?

238
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,947
Yeah, he popped
that little girl.

239
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,649
Lightweight,
compact hammerless.

240
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,585
So simple,
even a 7-year-old can use it.

241
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:20,386
This one especially. Safety's
tampered with, hair trigger.

242
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,120
Gangbanger, drug dealer.

243
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,527
Doesn't have the overkill they're
partial to, but not bad as a backup piece.

244
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,065
Chambered round fits.

245
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:30,260
Add a full clip, they get that
one extra bang for the buck.

246
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,236
And speaking of the bang...

247
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,307
the bullet Rodgers sent us,
after the autopsy.

248
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,601
Hollow point?

249
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,373
See the smooth edges where
it peeled apart on impact?

250
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,348
The tip was filed down
in an "X" pattern, by hand.

251
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,280
Little girl didn't have a
chance. Neither did this guy.

252
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,322
It's hard to compare
the lands and grooves...

253
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,018
because of their condition,
but look at the base.

254
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,958
Here's a side-by-side
comparison.

255
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,326
Same right twist,
same riflings.

256
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,332
Where'd you get this one from?
A 23-year-old.

257
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,162
Your gun's got
a second body on it.

258
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,442
Shorty Esposito.
Latino male, 23.

259
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,570
Got smoked in the ticker. Night
before your case. Close range.

260
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,616
Got dumped in an alley a couple of
blocks from where your kid lives.

261
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,913
You getting anywhere with it?
No, the case is cold.

262
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,818
We were hoping maybe your
7-year-old did our guy, too.

263
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,378
How do we know he didn't?

264
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,755
M.E. makes our shooter a good four
inches taller than our stiff, so...

265
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,589
Want to swap five's?

266
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,654
Two busts for drug possession, just
short of enough for intent to sell.

267
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,566
Mother swears by all known
saints he wasn't a dealer.

268
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,331
We think drug deal gone south.

269
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,841
Let's canvass the area between these
two. Got to be a link in there somewhere.

270
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,069
Hold on. Elliot,
look at his pants.

271
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,874
This can't be a coincidence.

272
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,177
Heck, we might have
just found our link.

273
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,213
Yeah, that guy I maybe seen
around. Tell me about him.

274
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,619
He likes bubble baths
and long walks.

275
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,058
I don't know jack about him.
I seen him on the block.

276
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,152
With anyone in particular?

277
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,231
You been following this story?
Who hasn't.

278
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,624
Little boy who shot this girl
did it with the same gun...

279
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,465
that was used
to whack this guy.

280
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,802
Tell us what you know about this
guy? I know nothing about the guy.

281
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:18,206
The stuff he was into, I don't want
to know. And what stuff would that be?

282
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,370
Mumbo jumbo.

283
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,847
Whenever I seen him,
he's coming out of Nestor's.

284
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,885
You Nestor?

285
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,518
Nicky Crow. Nestor sold me
the business last year.

286
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,225
And exactly what kind
of business is this?

287
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,164
Religious supplies.
For the practice of Santería.

288
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,630
Then those would be
sacrificial chickens.

289
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,137
It's legal. Santeros won
their Supreme Court case.

290
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,868
Relax, we're not
from the ASPCA.

291
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,170
You know him?
Yeah, he's a customer.

292
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,142
Was. Know anything about it?

293
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,581
Santeros don't sacrifice anything
further up the food chain than goats.

294
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,481
Long Island cheerleader
three years ago.

295
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,816
Mother and sister thought she
was possessed by a demon...

296
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,652
and they suffocated her.
Santeras, right?

297
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,522
That was an exorcism got
out of hand, not a sacrifice.

298
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,427
Shorty Esposito,
religious kind of guy?

299
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,793
Keeping the rituals a secret comes from the
slaves having to hide it from their masters.

300
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,734
That's not an answer.

301
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,940
Sure it is. It's in the
Constitution. Freedom of religion.

302
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,168
It's like dogma
not to talk about it.

303
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:28,373
I'd be violating his rights. He's
dead. He doesn't have any rights.

304
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,945
You a priest?

305
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,881
A Babalu?

306
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,583
Babalu. Atheist. Businessman.

307
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,857
300,000 people
practice Santería in New York.

308
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,058
They need to shop
someplace they can trust.

309
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,161
Hey, maybe someone tried to drive an
evil spirit out of him with a bullet.

310
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,496
My bet? That was his religion.

311
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,798
That guy right there on the
corner, that's the steerer.

312
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,464
He brings the buyer
to the money man.

313
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,667
And him hanging back
with the gold chain...

314
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,472
that's the money man.
He never touches the dope.

315
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,144
They're all teens. Maybe they know
Elias through a little brother.

316
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,979
Somewhere around here.
911!

317
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,213
He's the lookout.

318
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,858
What's your name, man?
Sammy.

319
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,760
Sammy what?
Sosa.

320
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,095
That's Mrs. Morales' boy,
Jamal.

321
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,999
Shut up, old man. Hey, Jamal,
you just focus all right.

322
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,593
You know this kid?
No.

323
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,434
What about him?
Nope.

324
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,667
Hey, how old are you?
Ten.

325
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,106
Why don't you talk to him?
Come here a second.

326
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,247
Know his name?

327
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,307
Bobby Cruise.

328
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,648
He's in here all the time.
Yeah, with him?

329
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,619
No, another one of those boys.

330
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,026
Eighteen or 19 years old.
Called Sweetness.

331
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,656
Sweetness?
Real sweet tooth.

332
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,569
We saw Homicide.
They aren't doing any better.

333
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,830
Any luck on our sweet tooth?

334
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,340
Former juvenile offender. Now 19.
Placed in foster care at age eight.

335
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,238
Truancy. Shoplifting.

336
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,608
Moving up to drugs, larceny,
gun possession.

337
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,374
Given name is Antonio Strada.

338
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,882
Last person who posted bail
was his great grandmother.

339
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,713
Good old Mrs. Strada.

340
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,121
My great-grandson has nothing to
do with that little girl's death.

341
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,320
Mrs. Strada, you know Elias
got hold of a gun.

342
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,194
And you know, as well as we
do, that Antonio has had...

343
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,755
gun troubles in the past.

344
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,425
Once.
Twice.

345
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,797
He's changed.

346
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,498
He's getting
his life together.

347
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,873
He helps me with the kids.
Takes them to the park for me.

348
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,606
He buys them candy.

349
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,444
The kids call him Sweetness.

350
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:49,419
The candy store that he takes Elias
to alone is off a known drug corner.

351
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,723
Did you know that,
Mrs. Strada?

352
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,055
No, I... Sunday night, a
young man named Shorty...

353
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,289
was shot and killed with the same
gun Elias used to kill Carly Jackson.

354
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,831
The last time
your great-grandson...

355
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,332
was arrested
for gun possession...

356
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,165
he was with Shorty.
They did time together.

357
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,370
Mrs. Strada,
tell us where he is.

358
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,539
You don't understand,
he had a horrible childhood.

359
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,650
His father was in prison,
his mother...

360
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,081
who knows where
his mother was.

361
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,727
Please, don't hurt him.

362
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,775
Antonio, police.
We want to talk to you.

363
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,278
Sweetness?

364
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,621
Nobody in here.
Got blood on the walls.

365
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,790
Yeah, we got fresh blood
right here.

366
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,666
We need backup.
Two-five-two, East 132.

367
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,841
Body's down here.

368
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,927
It's him.

369
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,463
I need an ambulance now.

370
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:45,594
Who did this to you? Who cut
you, Sweetness? Who cut you?

371
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,400
Machete.

372
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,677
What'd he say?

373
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,394
I think he said Machet...

374
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,157
Machete. Machete.

375
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,898
Look at the pants,
they're both camouflage.

376
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,838
This is not Carly,
this is Shorty.

377
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,638
Meaning, Elias witnessed
this murder.

378
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,442
When he drew this, he wasn't
plotting out Carly Jackson's murder.

379
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,574
This was a cry for help. He wanted
somebody to know what he saw.

380
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,983
He's been through an
interrogation, a court hearing...

381
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,077
taken from his family...

382
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,952
and placed in detention. Why wouldn't
he have said something by now?

383
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,754
Look at the players involved.
Drug dealers and killers.

384
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,625
If Elias was drawn into this world
at all, he knows what happens...

385
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,720
to people who talk.

386
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,059
So what are we going to do?

387
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,862
When an accused stands mute, the
only thing the system can do...

388
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,402
is interpret his actions.

389
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,337
You know our take on it. Well,
I know what my boss' will be.

390
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,034
He'll still see a bad apple
who likes seeing people dead.

391
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,736
So Elias needs to talk.

392
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,513
His attorney won his motion.
He's back home until the hearing.

393
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,947
Go.

394
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,254
You know, you people
have some nerve!

395
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,980
It's been horrible
for the Barreras.

396
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,615
They're prisoners
in their own home.

397
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,991
The protesters, death threats, the
media trying to sneak into the building.

398
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,155
You know, we try
to be good parents, we do.

399
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,394
Social services is threatening
to remove their baby girl.

400
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,000
Mr. Barrera, it is imperative
we talk to Elias.

401
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,664
Why, so you can find something
else to charge him with?

402
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,764
Mrs. Barrera,
we believe that your son...

403
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,639
witnessed a murder
the night before the shooting.

404
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,141
What?

405
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,474
Oh, my God!

406
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,659
Stay back.

407
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,267
Elias, you remember me,
Elliot?

408
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,572
How are you doing?

409
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,844
We got a problem here,
big man.

410
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,483
I hear you've been
dragged into something bad.

411
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,611
Me and Sweetness, we talked.

412
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:19,384
Now, he says he's got you all
hooked up and slinging for him.

413
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,096
What do you do with all
the money that he gives you?

414
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,861
Well, you buy games,
new kicks, what?

415
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,433
Crayons?

416
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,603
Okay, Elias. Your parents
know about everything.

417
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,737
But you and me, right now...

418
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,577
Elias, you and me
have got to fix this.

419
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,029
He puts little bottles
in my pockets.

420
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,460
Okay, that's good. You're
doing great. Now, you and me...

421
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,837
let's talk about
the gun, okay.

422
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,905
Tell me about this.

423
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,807
He told me
to stay in the room.

424
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,914
I didn't. I saw him
shoot the man.

425
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,522
Okay. What's that
at the end of the gun?

426
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,398
A pillow. You could hardly
hear the bang.

427
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,668
Why did Sweetness
shoot Shorty?

428
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,904
He didn't.

429
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,200
Isn't that him
holding the gun?

430
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,809
Well, who is it?

431
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,444
Machete.

432
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,084
What did you say?
Machete.

433
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,788
Do you know Machete?

434
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,695
Well, how do you
know his name?

435
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,026
I heard Shorty say, "Stop, Machete,
don't, please, don't. Stop. "

436
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,567
And then what happened?

437
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:14,401
I heard sirens,
and Machete ran away.

438
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,969
And what happened to the gun?

439
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,437
Sweetness hid it in the couch.

440
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,310
And then he got
a big suitcase.

441
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,317
And I hid in the closet
because I was scared.

442
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,821
Then what happened?
I heard him leave.

443
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,851
Why did you take the gun?

444
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,196
I didn't want him
to kill me, too.

445
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,164
Okay.

446
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,299
Okay. Now, this is very
important. Where did this happen?

447
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,178
My sister was in the hospital.

448
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,982
And you were at Mrs. Strada's?

449
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,819
Mrs. Strada?

450
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,597
What is going on?
No one is telling me anything.

451
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,133
Mrs. Strada, where were you
Sunday night?

452
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,534
Sunday between 10:00 and
midnight. I was asleep.

453
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,504
Are you a sound sleeper?

454
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,902
Well, I take meclizine
at night. It knocks me out.

455
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,105
Hey, anything?

456
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,341
Dried pee, Cheerios.

457
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,317
Old lady got kids?
She takes care of them.

458
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,820
Our guy apparently
cleaned up after himself.

459
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,857
Make sure you check sinks,
drains, traps, sponges.

460
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:43,690
Trash cans, light switches,
even lifted a few base boards.

461
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,827
No trace of blood yet.

462
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,788
Pillow's missing.

463
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,993
Okay, close the curtains.

464
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,631
We got blood.

465
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,572
Wheel marks.
Yeah.

466
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,570
Like the kind
on a big-ass suitcase.

467
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,445
They just stuffed old Shorty
in there and wheeled him on out.

468
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,681
Elias was right about the suitcase.
He also said he heard sirens.

469
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,018
Let's find out
what that problem was.

470
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,590
Party out of hand.
Somebody pulled out a knife.

471
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,960
Somebody else pulls out
a Louisville Slugger.

472
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,192
Brawl spilled out
into the courtyard.

473
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,236
You take any statements?
Thirty-five.

474
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,699
Stopped everyone
leaving the building.

475
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,741
If that's when our guy left the
building, he might be one of them.

476
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,336
Mind if we borrow these?
Great.

477
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:39,014
Off Elias' description, we've eliminated
28 names based on age and gender.

478
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,144
Which were brought down to eight
suspects, five of whom have records.

479
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,414
And mug shots.

480
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:47,219
Already there, we put together a
photo array, showed it to Elias.

481
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,157
He recognize any of them?
Yeah, two.

482
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,219
Unless I'm one of them, I don't
know why you're still standing here.

483
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,561
Because he's positive
neither of them is Machete.

484
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,100
So who do we have left?

485
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,295
The three who didn't
have records, so no photos.

486
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,066
Kyung Kwon, Nicky Crow,
and Bobby Cruise.

487
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,301
We've met them all,
all on the selfsame corner.

488
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,070
So one of them's Machete.

489
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,977
Kwon owns a market, and was pretty
helpful in getting us some IDs.

490
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,378
Yeah, maybe too helpful.

491
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,178
Crow profits off the piety
of the local Santeros.

492
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,684
Cruise is a dope dealer.

493
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,880
Elias needs some points
with the DA's office.

494
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,822
Call his attorney, s ee if
he'll let him do some walk bys.

495
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,188
Okay.

496
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,123
Okay. Are you up
for this, champ?

497
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,899
Is he gonna see me?

498
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,966
Keep your mask down.
Don't say anything, okay?

499
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,600
If you recognize any of these men as
Machete, just squeeze my hand, okay?

500
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,405
Okay.
All right. Come on.

501
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,819
Hello.

502
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,148
I'll be with you in a second.

503
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,162
Hey.
Hey.

504
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,762
Take him outside.

505
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,329
Nicky Crow, you're under
arrest... What're you doing?

506
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:10,203
for the murder of
Shorty Esposito. Hold it.

507
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,903
You have the right to remain
silent. Look in the refrigerator.

508
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,411
Yeah, we're not hungry.
I never met one who wasn't.

509
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,469
Go.

510
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,981
In the fridge?
Behind the box.

511
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,382
Behind the box.

512
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,613
What do we got?
I'm a business man.

513
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,987
Take it. Leave. Call it
cost of doing business.

514
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,923
Call it Class B felony.

515
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,528
It's okay to talk now.

516
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,160
Machete can't hurt you.
He's in jail.

517
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,209
I hear you're
a very good artist.

518
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,511
Do you draw all the time?

519
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,951
Yeah.

520
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,685
Can you draw me a picture of how
you felt that day in the schoolyard?

521
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,925
You were really scared.

522
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,055
Why?

523
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,759
I saw them behind the fence.
Who?

524
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,963
Machete and them.

525
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,435
What were they doing there?

526
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,799
They came to hurt me, too.

527
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,371
Elias...

528
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,045
who were you shooting at?

529
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,248
Machete.

530
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,184
I didn't mean to shoot Carly.

531
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,387
What's going to happen to me?

532
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,428
What do you think
should happen to you?

533
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,989
What's that?

534
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,357
Hell.

535
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,760
You think you're going to burn
in Hell for what you did?

536
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,404
I know why you're here.
Well, forget it.

537
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,509
I already gave Machete to McCoy.
You should have seen his face.

538
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,110
It was the same look my dog...

539
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,157
I'm not here to pick up a
case, I'm here to drop one.

540
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,650
Oh, no, we can't give
that kid a free ride.

541
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,161
We only got Machete
because of Elias' drawing.

542
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,129
That doesn't bring
Carly Jackson back.

543
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,361
Her death is a tragedy, yes,
but it was self-defense.

544
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,902
The vice principal at the
school corroborates his story.

545
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,631
Machete and his gang
were there.

546
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,037
Did she see them attack him?
Draw a weapon?

547
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,736
This is what he thinks
is going to happen to him.

548
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,835
Well, I think that
makes your case...

549
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,813
and proves that he knows the
difference between right and wrong.

550
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,544
No, we are the ones who
don't know the difference...

551
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,214
I'll be right there.

552
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,054
Fine, amend the charges
to manslaughter.

553
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:51,027
I don't want to prosecute a child at
all for a series of society's mistakes.

554
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,859
The Barrera's HMO wouldn't
cover their baby's condition...

555
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,626
forcing them to work two jobs.

556
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,295
They had to find affordable daycare for
Elias which we both know is nonexistent.

557
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,361
So they put him in Mrs.
Strada's illegal daycare.

558
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,964
An 82-year-old woman
looking after 15 children...

559
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,602
whose great-grandson was
using Elias as a drug runner...

560
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:10,875
and giving him access to a
loaded semi-automatic handgun.

561
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,179
And don't get me started on the
accessibility of handguns to minors.

562
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,810
This boy should not
be put away.

563
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,822
Nobody in Sing Sing had
a great childhood, Ms. Cabot.

564
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,223
You start killing at seven,
it's not a bad predictor.

565
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,689
You are unbelievable.

566
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:29,859
No, I am second-in-command and I
have Lewin's full support in this.

567
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,801
Now, listen, people know what
happened. They want justice.

568
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,202
I need someone
held responsible.

569
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:48,113
The death of Carly Jackson
is the ultimate tragedy.

570
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,847
There are no easy solutions,
but we in the DA's office...

571
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,519
have a moral imperative
to do the right thing...

572
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:01,261
and I assure you that justice
will be served.

573
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:06,527
I am placing full authority
in the worthy hands...

574
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:11,332
of a person who has been intimately
involved with every aspect...

575
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,173
of the case
from the beginning.

576
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,874
Assistant District Attorney
Alex Cabot.

577
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:23,115
Will you be prosecuting
7- year-old Elias Barrera?

578
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,779
A Latino boy killed
an African-American girl.

579
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,553
Are you at all concerned
that if you don't prosecute...

580
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,151
it may ignite tensions
in the neighborhood?

581
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,132
We know this was in no way
racially motivated.

582
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,135
I'm sure no responsible
member of the press...

583
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:42,172
would even think to put
that kind of slant on it.

584
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,739
He hung her out to dry.

585
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,242
No matter what she does
to Elias, it's lose, lose.

586
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,868
Half the city's going
to hate her.

587
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,004
The other half
won't be turning back flips.

588
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,982
I talked to the Barreras, Elias
was formally expelled from school.

589
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,347
The State sent a tutor.

590
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,978
Don't let that get out. The
state of our educational system...

591
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,453
people will be
killing to get one.

592
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,854
Is there anything
we can do for Cabot?

593
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,893
We've exhausted the pool of
sacrificial heads for the platter.

594
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,487
It's out of our hands. She needs
to look at alternate solutions.

595
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,456
Liz, my career's
on the line here.

596
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:13,493
And a little boy's future. Believe
me, I haven't forgotten about him.

597
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,738
I can't believe my boss
did this to me.

598
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,173
That's what they do at the boy's
club. Why do you think I left?

599
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,767
What would you do?

600
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,075
I really shouldn't discuss
the particulars with you...

601
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,308
while I'm on retainer
by the defense.

602
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,816
Hypothetically.

603
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,052
I wouldn't make him another
throw-away kid and just warehouse him.

604
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,522
I'd put him
in supervised counseling.

605
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:38,085
That's not going to sate the public's
bloodlust. Someone has to be punished.

606
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,663
You know, I had a political
future at one point.

607
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,495
Alex, the historical figures
I respect the most...

608
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,731
aren't the ones who started wars,
but those who brought about peace.

609
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,204
You have a real
opportunity here.

610
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,739
The respondent clearly
understands the difference...

611
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,146
between right and wrong.

612
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,947
At the time he pulled the
trigger, he knew what he was doing.

613
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,978
He intended to cause physical injury
or death to the boys at the fence.

614
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,184
Yes, he absolutely knows
what's going on here.

615
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,692
He understands the role
of the court...

616
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,227
he understands the role
of the Judge...

617
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,058
he knows his attorney
is here to help him.

618
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,826
He has the capacity to assist
in his own defense.

619
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,394
Dr. Olivet, have you reviewed
the State examiners' reports?

620
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,802
I have.

621
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:25,933
Well, do you concur with their
findings? They're absolutely right.

622
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,011
He does understand
the procedures of the court...

623
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,104
and he knows
his conduct was wrong.

624
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,910
But in my assessment,
the minor...

625
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,976
he knows it was wrong, but at the time
he pulled that trigger, he did not.

626
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,180
I have no more questions.

627
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,122
Dr. Olivet, you're familiar
with the People's exhibit "H"?

628
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,594
Very familiar.
I had him draw it.

629
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,299
And what exactly
did you ask him to draw?

630
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,234
A portrait of himself
at the time of the crime.

631
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,295
There was no mention of fire
in the police report.

632
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:59,139
He added that to the picture when I asked
what he thought should happen to him.

633
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,269
And what do
the flames represent?

634
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,442
Hell.

635
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,710
That's taking the consequences
of his actions...

636
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,911
to the ultimate extreme,
isn't it?

637
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,280
Obviously, he has
the capacity to understand.

638
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,257
All children have some grasp
of right and wrong.

639
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,884
I've seen children
younger than seven...

640
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,691
who believe they're going to
hell because they told a fib.

641
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,595
How do you explain
his lapse in judgment...

642
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,827
at the time
he pulled the trigger?

643
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,892
He was in mortal fear.

644
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,571
Not only that,
he was imitating behavior.

645
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:33,105
He had seen these men wave a gun to
scare people, and he did the same.

646
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,642
He just wanted them
to go away.

647
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,844
He was imitating behavior
without understanding it...

648
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,908
the danger, risks,
or morality.

649
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:47,355
And on what exactly do you base
your findings on his capacity?

650
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,726
Solely on his age
and development.

651
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,160
He's 7 years old.

652
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,032
Thank you. You may step down.

653
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,649
Your Honor...

654
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,815
the People defer
to Dr. Olivet's findings...

655
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,253
that the minor
lacked the capacity...

656
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,853
to understand the consequences
of his actions...

657
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,866
and therefore should not
be held responsible.

658
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,499
The People
are withdrawing charges?

659
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,072
It's clear the respondent lacked
the mens rea to commit a crime.

660
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,574
Therefore, we will
not pursue the case.

661
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,859
I know some of you are not
happy with today's decision.

662
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,457
But there's something
I'd like you to hear.

663
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,230
We heard you loud and clear.

664
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,101
The killers of black children
get off scot-free!

665
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,670
This cycle of violence
has got to stop somewhere.

666
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,074
Let it be here.

667
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,918
I'm Carly Jackson's mother.

668
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,619
I know you're all here
out of concern.

669
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,486
And I thank you.

670
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,817
But I have a favor to ask.

671
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,494
Go home.

672
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,059
Take care of your children.

673
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,410
Teflon.

674
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,538
I'm just glad the city
isn't burning.

675
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,014
You more than survived,
you're a hero.

676
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,880
Congratulations.
Thanks.

677
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,382
Actually, my boss is so happy,
he said I could take Sunday off.

678
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,048
We were on our way
to McMullen's.

679
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,786
How about we buy you
a congratulatory drink?

680
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,623
Sure.
Great.

681
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,629
Hey, Cap, you coming?

682
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,515
Police, coming through.

683
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,149
Neighbors jumped him.

684
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,744
Would have killed him if
we hadn't been a block away.

685
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,280
Who is he?

686
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,517
A relative?
Outraged citizen.

687
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,116
How old is he?
Twelve.

688
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:39,458
Name's Thomas James. Goes
by TJ. Anyone see it happen?

689
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,658
Best we can put together, he tried
to join a group of kids playing ball.

690
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,928
They shunned him.
He walks off, alone.

691
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,902
That's when TJ shows up.

692
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,642
Get off me, man.
Hey, leave me alone.

693
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,278
Can't kill a sister
and just walk.

694
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,814
Hey, come on, man. Leave me
alone, man. I ain't do nothing man.

695
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,175
Cycle never ends, does it?

696
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,014
Welcome to the Gaza Strip.
