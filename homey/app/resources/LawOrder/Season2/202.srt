1
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,215
In the criminal
justice system...

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,986
sexually-based offenses

3
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,789
are considered
especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,330
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

5
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,195
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

6
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,824
are members of an elite squad

7
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,493
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

8
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,161
These are their stories.

9
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:44,008
I found her moaning, half-naked,
bleeding from her chest and privates.

10
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,341
Couldn't tell her age.
Her face was too badly beaten.

11
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,074
She moan anything
you could make out?

12
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,513
Nothing that sounded
like words.

13
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,812
We got this call 45 minutes
ago. Why is she still here?

14
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,375
They've only been here
five minutes.

15
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,785
Moses wasn't available
to part the morning rush hour.

16
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,254
Deep stab wound, left chest.

17
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,415
Hand me a 4 by 4.

18
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,823
I was afraid to move her. I called
for the bus, I put a rush on it.

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,883
What have we got?

20
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,826
Good old-fashioned stoning,
New York style.

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,558
My guess,
after the stabbing and rape.

22
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:06,621
What about the weapon?

23
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:07,961
Nothing yet.
Any ID?

24
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,023
Still looking.

25
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,093
BP 90 over 60. That's as
good as we're gonna get.

26
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,900
Let's get her
out of here.

27
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,504
What is this, open season?

28
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,137
A few drinks, a little smoke, a bunch
of guys wet down a couple dozen women?

29
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,407
Wilding's back in vogue.

30
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,675
I hate that word "wilding. "

31
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,341
Like it's some kind of party.

32
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,442
You ride,
I'll cover the scene?

33
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,567
Is there anything I can tell
the chief of detectives...

34
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,234
when he calls me
for the fifth time?

35
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,505
Female Jane Doe,
probably in her 20s.

36
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,481
She was raped, stabbed, and
beaten with stones. Left for dead.

37
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,045
No clue who she is?

38
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,143
We grid-searched,
put divers in the pond.

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,085
The scene was
pretty much trampled.

40
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,784
It could have been a dump job.
No ID, no knife.

41
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,916
I rode the bus with her.

42
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,089
She was mumbling something in Arabic or
Hebrew. Nothing that I could make out.

43
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,222
Thanks.

44
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,789
That was the hospital. They
got post-op photos for us.

45
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,394
They poured four units in her.
It's touch and go she'll survive.

46
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,870
What about
the rape kit?

47
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:57,899
It turned up hair, semen, bruising, and
blood from a freshly perforated hymen.

48
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:58,966
A virgin.

49
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,276
You know what the chief was telling
me during our last conversation?

50
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,316
It's pucker time, folks.

51
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,347
Now, call every precinct,
transit, and housing district.

52
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,354
See if anybody
reported her missing.

53
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,356
Go talk
to the park precinct captain.

54
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,188
See if there's any ongoing
problems we should know about.

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,195
But be warned,
that guy is a jerk times 10.

56
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,991
Crime in the park
is the lowest in 30 years.

57
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,192
It was different today.

58
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,531
Today was an anomaly.
That's why I'm out here.

59
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,300
All we're asking is whether you have any
wolf-pack type activity on your radar.

60
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,398
Like the wilding after
the Portofino Day Parade.

61
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,669
Another anomaly.

62
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,509
Look, we get the usual isolated
incidents, but no gangs. Not in my park.

63
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,946
Captain, one more question...

64
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,575
Look, call me.
I got people waiting.

65
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,351
Had a nice chat with
your superior. Lovely guy.

66
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,094
Capt. Walson give you
the not-in-my-park routine?

67
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,529
Why? You know different?

68
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,727
He's worried about getting his ass
dragged down to the Morris Commission.

69
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,167
Why, what's he spooked about?

70
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,365
The brass versus big bucks,
with him in the middle.

71
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Bunch of private school punks on their
mountain bikes trying to be gangsters...

72
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,279
who get their kicks lifting purses,
or surrounding some pretty thing...

73
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,644
and scaring the hell
out of her.

74
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,842
And he didn't tell us this
because...

75
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,818
Because he didn't spot
this pattern till yesterday.

76
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,319
Know who these kids are?

77
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,016
Yeah, I busted one of
their leaders last week.

78
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,122
Hi. I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler.

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,189
What now?

80
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,633
Is Chris Lyons at home?

81
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:33,433
You want to talk to him?
Here, call our attorney.

82
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,266
We can either do this the easy
way, or we can do it your way.

83
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,310
Now, your way means
a search warrant.

84
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,073
Six officers
inside your townhouse...

85
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,137
turning it upside down
well into the evening.

86
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm sure your neighbors
would understand.

87
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,516
We'll meet you
at our attorney's office.

88
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,614
Is there a reason
you're harassing my client?

89
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,489
Yeah. Your client
was arrested last week...

90
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,359
for threatening a mother
walking her infant in a stroller.

91
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,898
She was a dime, yo.

92
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,991
Chris.
I was just checking her out.

93
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,865
We've already
answered that charge.

94
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,700
Hey, yo, where were you
early this morning?

95
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,867
My God. You're talking
about that woman.

96
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,243
The attack in the park.

97
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,007
How dare you accuse my son...

98
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,411
David.

99
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,005
I wasn't there.

100
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,983
He was home all night.

101
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,786
And don't you
say another word.

102
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,787
How about we hear
about it from him?

103
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,221
How about we don't?
He's 15.

104
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,226
Hey, yo, homeys,
you walk the walk.

105
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,352
You got it in you
to talk the talk?

106
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,036
So we like to look
at the ladies.

107
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,733
But what happened to that
lady, we're not down with that.

108
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,108
What are you down with?

109
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,113
Dot-comming.

110
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,706
From 1:00 in the morning
till Pops here kicked me off.

111
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,014
Around 9:00.
You can check our records.

112
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,646
We'll be in touch with you.

113
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,391
What have we got?

114
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,623
Lab called.
It's not what we thought.

115
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,733
Your victim only had
one person's DNA inside her.

116
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,894
She was dumped
after she was stabbed.

117
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,562
Are you sure about that?

118
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,970
Hospital says she lost
half her blood volume.

119
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,635
We didn't find anywhere near
that amount of blood at the scene.

120
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,143
Okay. Fibers?

121
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,372
White cotton.

122
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:24,109
Found in the blood, on her
clothes, her legs and genitals.

123
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,242
Meaning she wasn't
wearing any pants.

124
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,686
The attack followed the rape
by maybe eight hours.

125
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,623
Anything on the rocks?

126
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,318
We found a bloody print.

127
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,886
Doesn't match the victim or
anyone in the system. But this...

128
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,595
may help you ID her.

129
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,065
She was wearing it.

130
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,366
CSU picked it up
at the hospital.

131
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,105
Hanford.

132
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,638
You wanted to go back to
college. Now's your chance.

133
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,474
Any of these?

134
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,674
No.

135
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,252
No. No. No.

136
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,189
We think she's from somewhere
in the Middle East, maybe Israel.

137
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,558
Wait. Elliot, look at this.

138
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,487
Amir...
Amir, Nafeesa.

139
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,796
23, School of Journalism.
Post office box...

140
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,268
That zip code looks
like the East Village.

141
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,326
She's from Afghanistan.

142
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,806
Emergency notification,
Daoud Tarzi, East Village.

143
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,409
We need to fax Munch
that photo ID.

144
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,679
Mr. Tarzi?

145
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,708
He doesn't live here anymore.
What do you want?

146
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,185
Who are you?

147
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,477
David Hamoud.

148
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,114
How about some ID?

149
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,356
Anything with a photo
on it?

150
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,659
No, I don't drive...

151
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,602
and my passport's
in my safety deposit box.

152
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,541
Have you seen this woman?

153
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,701
No. Who is she?

154
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,971
How long
have you lived here?

155
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,249
I just moved in last week.

156
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,875
Do you know
where Mr. Tarzi is?

157
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,886
I'd tell you
who the super is if I knew.

158
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,184
I got a stuffed drain
with his name on it.

159
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,486
You got that trying
to fix it yourself?

160
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,025
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

161
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,760
I'm sorry, if you'll excuse
me. I'm late for a meeting.

162
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,557
I'll be back in the evening
if you want to talk.

163
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,567
Oh, God.

164
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,269
Is that her?

165
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,967
I can't be sure.

166
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,937
She missed class
this morning.

167
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,102
Is that unusual?

168
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,113
I've had Nafeesa in different
sections each semester.

169
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,671
She's never
missed a class.

170
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,683
You ever talk
one-on-one with her?

171
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,979
Constantly.

172
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,321
She couldn't believe
how free the press is here.

173
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,825
The Taliban government in
Afghanistan controls the media...

174
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,985
the way they control women.

175
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,891
She came here
to escape?

176
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,294
Well, unless she sneaked
out of the country...

177
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,560
her parents must also be here.

178
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,893
Afghan women can't even leave
their homes on their own.

179
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,200
She have any friends
in the class?

180
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,935
Annette Fleming.
They were joined at the hip.

181
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,209
It's her.

182
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,541
I can't believe it.

183
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,674
When was the last time
you saw her?

184
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,777
Just yesterday, in class.
How could this happen?

185
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,719
Well, maybe you can
help us find out.

186
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,485
Was she acting like
anything was wrong lately?

187
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,756
The opposite.
Nafeesa was loving life.

188
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,656
She have a boyfriend?

189
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,721
She wouldn't talk about it.

190
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,591
I think it was her way
of protecting herself.

191
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,637
Protecting herself
from what?

192
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,103
Her father.

193
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,202
An Afghan diplomat.

194
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,438
She thought that he may
have been looking for her.

195
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,480
If he had his way, Nafeesa
and I wouldn't even be friends.

196
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,037
Sounds like a strict guy.

197
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,605
A control freak.

198
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,482
He wouldn't let her go out,
made her wear the robes.

199
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,384
Like she had to back home?

200
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,923
She'd wear them
when she left the house...

201
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,891
and change
when she got to school.

202
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,827
She hated so much
that she had to do that.

203
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,092
She was talking to Prof. Husseini,
who was helping her to adjust.

204
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,432
And where did she keep
these forbidden clothes?

205
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,971
In her locker.

206
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,072
You gotta sign for this.

207
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,136
Yep.

208
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,351
That's it?

209
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,444
That'll be all.

210
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,783
Thanks, guys.

211
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,724
Can you imagine what Maureen would do
if you told her she couldn't wear jeans?

212
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,761
That's a place
I wouldn't go.

213
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,086
Boyfriend?

214
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,324
Could be.

215
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,802
Her address. East Side.

216
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,109
This young woman was found
in the park.

217
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,668
Do you recognize her?

218
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,879
It is our daughter.

219
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,110
She's in Intensive Care
at Mount Sinai.

220
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,378
She's dead?

221
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,013
Actually, she's in critical
condition, but she is still alive.

222
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,885
Nafeesa did not
understand her place.

223
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,362
She chooses a man's work.

224
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,860
She turns her back on her
traditions, on her family.

225
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,858
We still have a son, Jaleel.

226
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,665
But she is dead to us.

227
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,138
Sir, your daughter
was beaten and raped.

228
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,401
It is zina.

229
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,499
Zina?

230
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,239
She has slept with a man
who was not her husband.

231
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,549
Do you recognize
this man?

232
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,708
No.

233
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,178
Your son is...

234
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,689
He's not here.

235
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,653
Please.

236
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:40,064
My wife and I suffer agony
that she chose this life.

237
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,892
Please to leave us to grieve
for our daughter.

238
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,996
What, it's her fault
she was raped?

239
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,133
She brought shame and
dishonor to her family.

240
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,370
They behead women for that
where she comes from.

241
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,073
My first wife dishonored me.
I had to pay her alimony.

242
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,638
Look what we found
in the knapsack.

243
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,546
Boyfriend, maybe? Suspect.

244
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,143
We're in the diplomatic
community now.

245
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,519
Anybody know what her
father does for the Afghanis?

246
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,989
Only that
he's with the mission.

247
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,923
Well, let's get specific,
people.

248
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,620
If they're covered
by immunity...

249
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,357
and we go to them with anything
but their daughter's condition...

250
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,228
the "G" is all over us.

251
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,494
Son of a bitch.

252
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,466
What?

253
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,093
It's that guy
from the apartment.

254
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,432
Who said
he never heard of her.

255
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,437
Right.

256
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,440
Well, maybe we should
refresh his memory.

257
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,839
Pick him up.

258
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,078
He's halfway down the block.

259
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,827
He made us.

260
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,260
Hi. How are you?

261
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,944
Stick them in the air.

262
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,818
Nice tackle.

263
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,013
You won't find her!

264
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,817
I'll never tell them
where she is!

265
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,949
Hear that? I'll never
tell them where she is.

266
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:13,957
Who's them?

267
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,687
You'll never find her.
We already did.

268
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,353
You have the right
to remain silent.

269
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,919
Anything you say can
and will be used...

270
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,695
against you in a court of law. You
have the right to an attorney...

271
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,501
Name's Daoud Tarzi, 33.
No priors.

272
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,633
Immigration said he got here
in '88, alone, no family.

273
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,199
Became a citizen in '93.

274
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,336
And what does he do?

275
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,006
His own import-export
business. Fabrics.

276
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,949
Well, let's keep this out of the
papers until we're sure he's the doer.

277
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,214
I want to see her.

278
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,623
Why? So you can
beat her up some more?

279
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,263
How bad is she?

280
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,759
Critical.

281
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,594
I'm responsible for this.

282
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,138
Okay, you want to tell us
about it?

283
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,811
I love her.

284
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,279
We argued.

285
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,284
She ran out.

286
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,853
What did you fight about?

287
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,754
Does it matter?
Her father already won.

288
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,420
Won what?

289
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,420
His twisted sense of honor.

290
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,187
His revenge
for her leaving home.

291
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:30,693
Well, he said she was dead to him.
Didn't sound like he wanted revenge.

292
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,637
What he doesn't want is a reputation for
letting his women do what they please.

293
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,765
What do you want?

294
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,174
For her to stop acting like
she's from some primitive tribe.

295
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,678
You couldn't handle that.

296
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,940
She wouldn't let go.

297
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,448
So you decided
to do something about it.

298
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,541
I overreacted.

299
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,984
We argued.

300
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,653
I dared her to leave.

301
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,718
I never thought she'd leave.

302
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,794
I love her.

303
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,362
I wanted to marry her.

304
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,003
Find somebody who heard that
argument. I'll call Cabot for warrants.

305
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,138
Yeah, I heard them fighting.

306
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,267
In their first language. English
is definitely their second.

307
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,367
Anything you understood?

308
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,002
Before the screaming
started...

309
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,013
she called him
a control freak.

310
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,378
And something
about her father.

311
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,473
Then what?

312
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,245
Then five minutes
of gibberish.

313
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,513
Door slams,

314
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,350
and one of them stomps
down the stoop.

315
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,480
Just one of them?

316
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,080
Yeah, just one.

317
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,683
Whoever stayed
turned on the TV.

318
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,665
They looked happy.

319
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,558
They all look happy.

320
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,597
This was in the laundry. Bed
sheet. There's blood on it.

321
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,511
Okay, lab says the bloodstain
on the bed sheets, it's hers.

322
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,516
Semen's definitely his.

323
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,148
What about the stones?

324
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,743
No match on the prints...

325
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,222
but they got an odd reading on
the blood, so they're retesting it.

326
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,952
Print's not his
or hers.

327
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,195
Even without the blood on the rocks,
it's his semen. Her blood on his sheets.

328
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,629
It's no problem.

329
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,766
People v. Daoud Tarzi.

330
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,805
"One count attempted murder,
second degree...

331
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,466
"one count rape
in the first degree. "

332
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,536
Mr. Gibson,
how does your client plead?

333
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,079
Not guilty on both counts,
Your Honor.

334
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,478
Ms. Cabot?

335
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,017
Your Honor, this was
a particularly brutal crime.

336
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,815
The victim was raped, stabbed,
beaten, and left to die.

337
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,548
We're asking
for remand without bail.

338
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,954
My client has no criminal
history, Your Honor.

339
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,016
He's an upstanding member
of his community...

340
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,823
he has his own
import-export business...

341
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,659
Good. Let's make sure
he doesn't export himself.

342
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,757
The defendant is remanded
without bail.

343
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,492
What does that mean?

344
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,103
Her parents are here.

345
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,211
He wants me to tell you
that her parents are here.

346
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,371
So noted.

347
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,848
He also wants me to tell you that
he will take a lie detector test...

348
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,475
against my advice.

349
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,381
Our examiner.
I'll set it up.

350
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,290
Is your name Daoud Tarzi?

351
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,689
Yes.

352
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,199
Were you born in Lebanon?

353
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:17,891
No.

354
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,899
Were you born
in Afghanistan?

355
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,865
Yes.

356
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,506
Did you rape Nafeesa Amir?

357
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,373
No.

358
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,712
Do you now live
in Afghanistan?

359
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,776
Her parents were
at the arraignment.

360
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,413
That's a strange way
to show you don't care.

361
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,014
Do you now live
in the United States?

362
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,415
Yes.

363
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,227
Did you stab Nafeesa Amir?

364
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:48,922
No.

365
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,670
How did he do?
Passed.

366
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,104
Or beat it.

367
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,838
He's not the first person
to fool the box.

368
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,674
If he can fool the box,
he can fool the jury.

369
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,407
Maybe he's
telling the truth.

370
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,244
If he proposed marriage
to Nafeesa...

371
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,841
there has to be somebody else
who knows about the relationship.

372
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,910
She wouldn't even tell
her best friend about it...

373
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,579
for fear of how
her family would react.

374
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,214
That Hanford professor.

375
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,853
He's a Mideast specialist. He was counseling
Nafeesa on adapting to life in America.

376
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,057
We were going to go talk to him
until we thought Tarzi confessed.

377
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,600
Well, let's see
if your professor can tell us

378
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,034
why their love
had to be such a secret.

379
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,100
Nafeesa Amir came
to you for help.

380
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,507
Lots of students from
my part of the world do.

381
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,273
To help them assimilate.

382
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,836
It's tough enough
for a man.

383
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,313
It's even tougher
for a woman.

384
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,314
How so?

385
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,910
They're tempted by all of the things
they're not allowed to do back home.

386
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,047
Under the Taliban regime,
that means almost everything.

387
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,092
Like having a job,
going to school.

388
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,424
Leaving the house alone, or without
every inch of one's body covered.

389
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,726
She would be scorned
as a vice-monger.

390
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,266
What about her family?
They've been here for years.

391
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,768
Her family, like all the
Afghan diplomats at the UN...

392
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,861
are holdovers
from the previous government.

393
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,032
They treated women like something
more than just indentured servants.

394
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:07,101
But when the Taliban took over, they
put women under virtual house arrest.

395
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,205
There is nothing in the Koran
that allows them to do that.

396
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,147
Well, tell their thugs.

397
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,949
It would be like the militia
running this country.

398
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,282
That's why the UN
won't recognize them.

399
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:22,088
It would be very dangerous for
Nafeesa's family to try and go back home.

400
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,721
So Nafeesa's father
is not a Taliban?

401
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,988
Maybe he's a Taliban mole.

402
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:31,229
Just because he doesn't wear their
colors does not mean he isn't with them.

403
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,061
Nafeesa had to choose between
her family and her future.

404
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,333
She wanted to live
as a modern woman.

405
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,003
She had to leave
her parents' home to do it.

406
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,047
Was there any reason she'd
want to hide from her family?

407
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,209
If she tried this kind
of thing in Afghanistan...

408
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,148
women there
have been murdered for less.

409
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,018
Much less.

410
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,057
We have enough
to convict you, Mr. Tarzi.

411
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,089
Even if you did pass the lie detector
test, you confessed to the police.

412
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,328
Confession?
I never confessed.

413
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,395
You said, quote,
"I am responsible for this. "

414
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,873
I meant that I feel responsible,
not that I attacked her.

415
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,401
He passed the lie detector test.
It wasn't his DNA on the stones.

416
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,538
It was his DNA inside her.

417
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,518
We were from the same part
of Afghanistan.

418
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,656
Near Kabul.

419
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,089
I helped her
to find an apartment.

420
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,528
I wanted to help her
find herself.

421
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,501
What was she looking for?

422
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,333
To be more than a factory
for producing sons.

423
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,836
We fell in love...

424
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,142
but we couldn't tell anyone.

425
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,580
She didn't want her father
to find her.

426
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,850
Why? Was she afraid of him?

427
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,595
She's the reason
he has his job...

428
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,357
his apartment,
his car with a driver.

429
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,060
How is it, in a society where a woman
has no authority, she has all this power?

430
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,672
He promised her to the son
of a government minister.

431
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,874
Turning her back on that was like
spitting in her father's face.

432
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,151
And the night Nafeesa
was attacked?

433
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,191
I asked her to marry me.

434
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,995
Gave her a diamond ring.

435
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,499
She said yes.

436
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,169
She was a virgin.

437
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,298
You forced her.

438
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,671
No.

439
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,105
She didn't say no.

440
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,173
But I shouldn't have
pushed her.

441
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,946
And she walked out?

442
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,350
She said I was trying
to dominate her.

443
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:08,590
She throws the ring in my face. Before
I could stop her, she's out the door.

444
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,123
I should have tried
to stop her.

445
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,989
Why all the lies?

446
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,790
You see this?

447
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,861
It's from a cop.

448
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,199
What cop?

449
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,374
Came looking for Nafeesa.

450
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,205
He had a gold badge.

451
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,110
I knew Nafeesa's father
sent him.

452
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,113
If it isn't Bishop Tutuola.

453
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,791
John Munch. Ross Campo.

454
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,287
What brings you guys
to this dump?

455
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,386
This.

456
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,594
It's yours.

457
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:46,653
What about it?

458
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,565
You laid it on the boyfriend of
that girl we found in the park.

459
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,431
I got nothing
to say about that.

460
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,097
He does. Especially the part
about you breaking his head.

461
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,572
Like you never tuned
anyone up on the job?

462
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,871
My pleasing personality
usually does the trick.

463
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,276
You, on the other hand,
weren't on the job.

464
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,439
So I do a little work
on the side.

465
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,005
Help me out here, Fin.

466
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,141
Come on.

467
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,482
Better us bring this
to you than IAB, right?

468
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,387
Last time I checked, cops weren't
allowed to moonlight as Pls.

469
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,952
Three weeks ago...

470
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,929
boss at the security company
I work for gets a call.

471
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,330
Some diplomat looking
for his missing daughter.

472
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,098
Says they're going back to their tent in
the desert, wants to bring her with them.

473
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,263
Asked me to check it out.

474
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,465
You find her?

475
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,440
I got as far as the boyfriend.

476
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,635
Says he doesn't know her.

477
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,645
His mouth is moving, her
picture's hanging behind him.

478
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,544
Like I'm some knucklehead.

479
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,105
So I tune him up a little.

480
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,616
But he still
didn't tell you.

481
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,983
Said I might as well shoot him,
'cause he was never gonna tell me.

482
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,783
And she never showed?

483
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,723
I sat on the place
for two nights. Nothing.

484
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,427
Final lab report.

485
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,432
And?

486
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,128
We've got a problem.

487
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,335
There were two types of DNA
on the stones.

488
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,566
One was Nafeesa's,
and the other was Tarzi's.

489
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,074
Well, if not him,
then who?

490
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,201
That's why
they retested the blood.

491
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,304
Lab says both DNA types
have similar characteristics.

492
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,042
Meaning it was
a family member.

493
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,414
Anything else we don't know
about these people?

494
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,750
The State Department has the
father listed as an attaché.

495
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,221
Diplomatic rank.

496
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,054
Jaleel Amir just turned 21,
graduated NYU.

497
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,491
He still lives
with his parents?

498
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,653
Yes, he does.

499
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,127
But he's not a student?

500
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,092
Hello?

501
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,297
His immunity expired the day
he turned 21.

502
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,569
She died 10 minutes ago.

503
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,472
Has Nafeesa Amir
been around lately?

504
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,607
Yeah. She was here
Tuesday night.

505
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,708
What time?

506
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:47,911
Around 7:00.

507
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,952
Woman gets out of a cab,
tries to run past me.

508
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,789
I didn't know it was Nafeesa.
She wasn't wearing the get-up.

509
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,019
She say anything to you?

510
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,424
Too busy crying.

511
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,626
I know she's family.
I just let her go up.

512
00:24:58,697 --> 00:24:59,925
Did you see her leave?

513
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,262
No. But that doesn't mean
she didn't.

514
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,529
I get off at 11:00.
Ask the night guy.

515
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,868
Anyone else in her family,
you see them come in or out?

516
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,507
Her brother came out.

517
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,769
Jaleel.

518
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,141
Bastard treats me
like his personal slave.

519
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,406
What time was that?

520
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,811
Around 8:00.

521
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:20,909
He calls, orders me to bring
the big shopping cart upstairs.

522
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,479
Did you?

523
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,421
You kidding? The guy hasn't
tipped me in four years.

524
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,254
Told him I couldn't leave the
desk, come get it yourself.

525
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,884
Any idea
what he wanted it for?

526
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,123
Whatever it was, he didn't
bring it through this door.

527
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,764
Must have put it in his car
in the garage.

528
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,231
I told you to leave us alone!

529
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,469
Sir, your daughter passed
away, and you don't even care.

530
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,737
Saleh?

531
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,667
Go now.
Where's your son?

532
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,678
Get out.

533
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,045
We know Nafeesa was here
the night of the attack.

534
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,209
Doorman saw her come in.
Nobody saw her leave.

535
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,686
Because your son took her out through
the garage and dumped her in the park.

536
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,019
Were you watching when he put
the knife through her heart?

537
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,955
She was a whore, like you.

538
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,091
She was your daughter!

539
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,389
He is on his way home
to Afghanistan.

540
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,589
Okay.

541
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,063
My son is protected
by the Vienna Convention.

542
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,264
Arresting him is a violation
of international law.

543
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,773
You need to take a refresher
course in international law.

544
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,605
The day he turned 21,
his number was up.

545
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,710
Would you like some? No?

546
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,681
Juice?

547
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,809
No, thanks.
We're just visiting.

548
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,356
Jaleel Amir?

549
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,953
I am proud I killed her.
She deserved to die.

550
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,930
This amuse you? Jaleel Amir, you're under
arrest for the murder of Nafeesa Amir.

551
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,762
You have the right
to remain silent.

552
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:47,168
You think you can arrest me? My father
will have me on the next plane home.

553
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,540
I'll probably need Munch
for trial.

554
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,098
Anticipating problems?

555
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,441
A diplomat's son?
I expect a very heavy gun.

556
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,981
Captain. Ms. Cabot.

557
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,784
Something wrong, sir?

558
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,514
All I want to know is,
did two of your detectives...

559
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,749
harass a diplomatic attaché?

560
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,693
No, sir. We went looking for his son.
But what we should have done was...

561
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,731
arrest Saleh Amir as an accomplice
to his daughter's murder.

562
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,822
If I may, I'd like to...

563
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,389
No, you may not.

564
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,795
Amir has filed a formal complaint
against the US government...

565
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:23,432
for his ill-treatment by the NYPD,
and the Feds are eating it up.

566
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:28,070
The case against Jaleel Amir is solid,
Deputy, and frankly, it's out of your hands.

567
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,138
I've got two rogue cops who
browbeat foreign officials...

568
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,344
two others who don't understand
the basic Miranda warning.

569
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,683
Cases get dismissed
for much less.

570
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,848
The suspect
was properly Mirandized.

571
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:42,450
He did confess before he was warned,
but it was an excited utterance.

572
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,358
Which makes it admissible.

573
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,421
The only way this case will not
see the inside of a courtroom...

574
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,364
is if Jaleel pleads out.

575
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,335
I suggest that you
reconsider your position.

576
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,070
And why would I want
to do that?

577
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,911
To save your own skin?

578
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,021
I need the five on your
tête-à-tête with Saleh Amir.

579
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,821
I'm cleaning it up right now. If
it's not pig Latin, "now" means now.

580
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,858
All right.
Where's the heat coming from?

581
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,228
The Commissioner. Saleh Amir
told the State Department...

582
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,063
that we violated Article 30
of the Vienna Convention...

583
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,160
because you grilled him
about his son.

584
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,226
We didn't grill him.

585
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,738
If this had happened
back home...

586
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,071
Jaleel would have done
three months in prison...

587
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,133
and gotten a hero's welcome
when he came out.

588
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,112
Well, this is the Afghanis
playing hardball.

589
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,148
They didn't
Mirandize my client.

590
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,848
It was an excited utterance. We
have a planeload of witnesses.

591
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,720
Relax, Ms. Cabot.

592
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,085
I'm not about to penalize the
police for doing their job.

593
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,722
Mr. Amir's confession was an
excited utterance, and it's in.

594
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:57,359
In that case, Your Honor, my
client is changing his plea...

595
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,029
to not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

596
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,129
Give me a break.

597
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,539
My client didn't know what he was doing
was wrong when he killed his sister.

598
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,009
Ignorance of the law
is not an affirmative defense.

599
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,047
He told the police
he was proud of what he did.

600
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,605
That sound sane to you?

601
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,446
Your Honor,
it's obvious what he's doing.

602
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:17,079
He can't hide behind the Fourth
Amendment, so now it's insanity.

603
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,386
And if I ignore him, it
could be reversed on appeal.

604
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,723
I'm ordering Mr. Amir
be examined by a psychiatrist.

605
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,235
You have nightmares
about Nafeesa?

606
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,009
The Koran says Nafeesa's shame
before God is her own.

607
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:43,480
That it can't be passed to you, that
she faces the consequences alone.

608
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,049
Did Abraham have a choice when Allah
commanded him to kill his own son?

609
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,696
I can't talk about this.

610
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,599
Can't or don't want to?

611
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,927
I have nightmares.
Isn't that enough?

612
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,698
How long have you
had the nightmares?

613
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,933
Since I was 8 years old.

614
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,706
When it happened.

615
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,277
Do they wake you up?

616
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,820
After he slits her throat.

617
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,815
Whose throat?

618
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,990
My aunt.

619
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,830
I can't do this.

620
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,064
Because you couldn't
stop it?

621
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,705
I was a child.
My father made me watch.

622
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,945
How was I supposed
to stop it?

623
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,448
Your father killed your aunt?

624
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,950
My grandfather.

625
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,951
His grandfather
killed his aunt

626
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,686
because she cheated
on her husband.

627
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,990
Jaleel was just
following the rules.

628
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,191
He's perverting holy scripture
to justify murder.

629
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,460
It's what he was taught.

630
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,470
His rite of passage
to manhood, to honor.

631
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,065
Meaning he doesn't know
what he did was wrong?

632
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,801
I think he does.

633
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,778
I asked him if he has nightmares
about his sister. He wouldn't answer.

634
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,107
His body language said yes.

635
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,617
And a jury may be just
as confused as he is.

636
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,718
Then you have to get a jury that
can see past their confusion.

637
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,095
Mrs. Weinberger,
would you have a problem...

638
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:41,359
finding a defendant from
the Middle East not guilty?

639
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,433
Absolutely not.

640
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,695
Thank you.

641
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,827
Mr. Post.

642
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:52,035
We thank Mrs. Weinberger for her
service, and ask that she be excused.

643
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,941
Approach, Your Honor?

644
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,650
All 10 of his peremptory
challenges have been women or Jews.

645
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,945
I don't have
to give a reason.

646
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,180
If this continues I'll have
to ask for a Batson hearing.

647
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,721
You can't let her
stack the jury...

648
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,723
With women? People v. Blunt.

649
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:10,124
The appellate division specifically
applied Batson to gender discrimination.

650
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,388
It applies to religion, too.

651
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,360
Your Honor...

652
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,159
Careful, Mr. Post.
Ms. Cabot is right.

653
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,030
You don't want a Batson
hearing in this court.

654
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,734
We boarded the plane.

655
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,106
The defendant was sitting
in the first-class cabin.

656
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,168
Did he know
you were there for him?

657
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,770
Yes. He smiled.

658
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,807
Tell the jury
what happened next.

659
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,875
Before we could read him
his Miranda Rights...

660
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,319
Mr. Amir confessed
to having killed his sister.

661
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,447
What were his exact words?

662
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,925
"I'm proud that I killed her.
She deserved to die. "

663
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,791
Thank you, Detective.

664
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:50,464
So, Mr. Amir showed no remorse
for having murdered his sister?

665
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,770
On the contrary,
he was proud of it.

666
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,101
In fact, you said
he seemed glad to see you.

667
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,731
I said he smiled.

668
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,538
He smiled at you
and said he was proud.

669
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,042
Doesn't seem like something
a sane person would do.

670
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,377
Objection! Detective Munch
is not a psychiatrist.

671
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,780
Withdrawn.

672
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,382
Detective, how many people have
you arrested in your career?

673
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,716
I don't know the exact number.

674
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:11,948
More than 100, correct?

675
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,115
Probably.

676
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,456
How many of them smiled at you
and said they were proud...

677
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,427
of having killed someone?

678
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,656
One.

679
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:25,294
And the defendant is that one
person, isn't that right, Detective?

680
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:27,995
Yes.

681
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,634
No further questions.

682
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,671
He shows signs
of severe trauma.

683
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,043
What signs?

684
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,445
Delusional thinking...

685
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,683
night terrors, vivid,
recurring dreams that wake him.

686
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,646
He avoids talking about it
if he can.

687
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,417
In your professional opinion,
Doctor...

688
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,425
do these symptoms
prevent Mr. Amir...

689
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,394
from knowing the difference
between right and wrong?

690
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,924
No.

691
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,157
Thank you.

692
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:02,035
Dr. Skoda, you say the defendant knows
what he did was wrong by our standards.

693
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,505
Yes.

694
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,201
Doctor,
if I wake in the night...

695
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:09,178
and I hear a noise, and I take my gun,
and I shoot an intruder in my house...

696
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,114
I know killing is morally wrong,
yet I did what I had to do...

697
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,117
to save my family from harm.

698
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,176
How is that different
from what the defendant did?

699
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,380
Objection. Relevance?

700
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,082
Goes to the defendant's
state of mind.

701
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,489
If you're arguing self-defense,
this is an insanity case.

702
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,290
And this question goes directly
to what was in my client's mind.

703
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,855
I'll allow it. Please answer
the question, Doctor.

704
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,102
Jaleel's sister wasn't
threatening to kill him.

705
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,436
But Jaleel thought his sister's actions
threatened to destroy his life...

706
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,840
and the lives of his future
children. Isn't that right, Doctor?

707
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,469
It's not a valid comparison.

708
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,741
Please answer
the question, Doctor.

709
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,783
Isn't it true
my client believed...

710
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,149
his sister's actions threatened
the lives of his family?

711
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,521
It's possible.

712
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,917
I can't say with certainty
what he was thinking.

713
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,187
Exactly. Thank you, Doctor.

714
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,199
In Deuteronomy,
the Bible says...

715
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,725
if a man meets a virgin in
a town and sleeps with her...

716
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,931
you shall stone them both
to death.

717
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,566
But, Professor, honor killing
isn't about religion.

718
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,373
No. The Koran says
all humans are equal.

719
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:20,513
It is about families and their honor
that determines their status in society.

720
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,844
So if a man believes a woman in his
family is sexually promiscuous...

721
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,186
she has reason
to fear for her life.

722
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,488
Yes. But countries like Jordan
and Egypt are trying...

723
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,018
to make honor killing as legally
heinous as any other murder...

724
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,928
with the same penalties.

725
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,364
Thank you, Professor.

726
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:42,870
Prof. Husseini, honor killings are
part of ancient cultural tenets.

727
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,839
Yes.

728
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:49,073
Part of the cultural fabric
that pre-exists modern society.

729
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,803
Yes.

730
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,643
So if you're raised in the
tradition of this ancient culture...

731
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,553
what would you believe would
happen to a family without honor?

732
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:03,019
The men could lose their jobs, the
children could become outcasts...

733
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,087
the family could be scorned and
mocked, with no chance of success...

734
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,626
until the honor is restored.

735
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,760
And for a man, that means
controlling his women?

736
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,826
Yes.

737
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,772
Isn't it true that last year,
three out of every four murders...

738
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,606
in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank were honor killings?

739
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,202
Yes. But the Palestinians...

740
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,681
Isn't it true that the only way these
countries have to protect women...

741
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,241
from their own families
is to put them in prison?

742
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,911
In protective custody, yes.

743
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,420
And isn't it correct,
Professor...

744
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,652
that in this barbaric custom,
the more brutal the killing...

745
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,592
the greater the honor restored
to the family?

746
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:39,618
Yes.

747
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,790
So it's reasonable, having
grown up in this world...

748
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:46,235
my client may have come to accept
honor killing as necessary to survive?

749
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:51,468
Well, he may have accepted it, but
I hardly think that it is reasonable.

750
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,814
I had to restore my family's honor.
We would never survive the shame.

751
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,010
You've had time
to think about it.

752
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,521
Would you change anything
that happened, if you could?

753
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,851
I would change
what Nafeesa did to us.

754
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,491
Thank you.

755
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,856
You killed your sister
because she was with a man.

756
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,992
Her marriage was arranged.

757
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,368
Being with another man
was not her decision to make.

758
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,904
When you dumped your
sister's body in the park...

759
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,069
why did you leave her
half-naked?

760
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,544
To shame her
as she shamed us.

761
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,214
And the stones?

762
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,983
That is what we do
to whores in my country.

763
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,378
You're proud
of what you did?

764
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:38,680
Yes.

765
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,656
Then, Mr. Amir,
why did you run away?

766
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,731
What do you mean?

767
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,767
You're a man, aren't you?

768
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,463
A man stands up
and takes responsibility.

769
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:57,166
A man isn't afraid to face the
consequences of his actions.

770
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,435
I am not afraid.

771
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,708
No? The police arrested you on
the plane. You were running away.

772
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,006
Does that sound honorable
to you?

773
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,381
Does that sound like something
a real man would do?

774
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,783
You are twisting everything.

775
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,219
Objection.
Badgering the witness.

776
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,725
Even now, you were looking at
your father to tell you what to do.

777
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,191
Does he tell you what to do?

778
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,125
Did he tell you
what to do that night, too?

779
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,288
Objection! Irrelevant.
Move to strike.

780
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,925
The jury will disregard the previous
mention of the defendant's father.

781
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,263
Move on, Ms. Cabot.

782
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,772
You were afraid of spending the rest
of your life in an American prison...

783
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,170
weren't you?
That's a lie!

784
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,266
Because you knew
what you did was wrong.

785
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,506
No! I did it
for our family's honor!

786
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,720
I'm concerned the jury's
buying Jaleel's act.

787
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:55,527
What? That anyone who kills his own sister
has to believe he's doing the right thing?

788
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,432
Right. Which makes him guilty by
reason of mental disease or defect.

789
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,799
Hard to argue with that logic.

790
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,462
You can see my problem.

791
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,564
When we collared him, he
was sitting in first class...

792
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,668
no cap, no beads, styling in
totally westernized Internet casual.

793
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,474
His wardrobe
isn't helping me.

794
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,947
If the jury thinks Jaleel is
culture-programmed to kill...

795
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,483
he gets his insanity verdict.

796
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,076
Well, we're out of people
to say otherwise.

797
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:19,281
His culture didn't program him
to kill. His father did.

798
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,155
Jaleel is afraid of him.
Everybody is afraid of Saleh Amir.

799
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,252
Except for one person.
We're forgetting Mrs. Amir.

800
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,160
Mrs. Amir is out-of-bounds.

801
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,324
Anyway, Mrs. Amir would never
give up her son...

802
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,765
or go against her husband.

803
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,962
She already has,
on both counts...

804
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,835
when she told us that he was
on a plane home to Afghanistan.

805
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,898
She testifies, she's
sentencing herself to death.

806
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,206
She defied her husband once
because he's the reason...

807
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,577
that her daughter's dead. She
wants justice for her memory.

808
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,182
We reach out to her again, I think
she'll defy him again to get it.

809
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,312
We can't ask unless
we're ready to protect her.

810
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,586
We're ready, 24-7. Talk
to her. Let her know that.

811
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,151
But don't cross
the diplomatic line.

812
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,863
I have already lost Nafeesa.

813
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,839
I don't want
to lose Jaleel, too.

814
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,009
But Nafeesa hasn't
lost her honor.

815
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,943
Have you lost yours?

816
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,047
You don't understand.

817
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,641
I think we do.

818
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,782
Nafeesa was your husband's
ticket home.

819
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,153
He promised her to a Taliban,
didn't he?

820
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,886
And when he found out that she
was sleeping with somebody else...

821
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,895
he had Jaleel kill her
in the name of honor.

822
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,629
We can offer protection
to you.

823
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,997
I don't want your protection.

824
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,471
I want my daughter.

825
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:56,412
Nafeesa came home
to be with us.

826
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,380
My husband asked her...

827
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,492
if she was still a virgin.

828
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,864
She wasn't.

829
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,756
What did he do?

830
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,897
Hit her.

831
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,300
She fell.

832
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,237
Then Jaleel tried to help her.

833
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,670
My husband said:

834
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:27,014
"Let her lie there, like she lies
with her American boyfriend. "

835
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,815
What happened next?

836
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:34,122
My husband got a knife
from the kitchen.

837
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:40,554
Jaleel, he begged him not to.

838
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:48,496
But my husband
told Jaleel to kill her...

839
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,836
for our honor.

840
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,037
To kill her...

841
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,042
to prove his manhood.

842
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,816
And he stabbed her.

843
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,464
And they took her away.

844
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,248
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

845
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,015
We have, Your Honor.

846
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,753
Will the defendant
please rise?

847
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,428
On the charge of murder in the
second degree, how do you find?

848
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,762
We find the defendant guilty.

849
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,857
This court is dismissed.

850
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,518
Captain? Jaleel is convicted.
Murder two.

851
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,053
Thanks.

852
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,386
You know, Saleh Amir didn't miss
a second of this trial until today.

853
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,056
You'd think he'd want
to hear the verdict.

854
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,198
He's gone.
Saleh Amir?

855
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,466
Left last night in a limo.

856
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,599
All that baggage, looked
like it was for good.

857
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,472
What about the wife?
She wasn't with him.

858
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,637
Okay, we need the keys now.

859
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,643
Olivia.
