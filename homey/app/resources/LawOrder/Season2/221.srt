1
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:25,212
In the criminaljustice system,

2
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:28,962
sexually based offenses
are consideredespecially heinous.

3
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,178
In New York City,

4
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:32,645
the dedicated detectives
who investigatethese vicious felonies

5
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:36,787
are members of an elite squad
known asthe Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,468
These are their stories.

7
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:42,520
I wish you'd stop dragging
me to these awful plays.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,091
It was nominated for a Tony.

9
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,362
Yeah. Now I know why it didn't win.

10
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:47,533
I don't complain when you make me

11
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:48,980
watch those damn 
cooking shows with you.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,752
Well, why should you?
They don't cost $75 a ticket.

13
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:55,458
- Ah, don't start with that...
- Quentin! Honey!

14
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:57,882
Watch where you're going!

15
00:00:57,882 --> 00:00:59,756
- Drunken fool!
- You stupid bastard!

16
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:02,549
- Honey, are you all right?
- I'm okay.

17
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,366
Quentin! / What? What is it?

18
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:07,435
Look at your coat.

19
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:10,574
You smell something?

20
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:14,608
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:22,905
It's the perp's coat.

22
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,541
Dumped it in the garbage 
can around the corner.

23
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,415
There's blood all over it.

24
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:27,426
Make my night, tell me
you found the victim's I.D.

25
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:29,540
Sorry.  Either it's toast or...
the fire department washed

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,354
it away with the rest of our evidence.

27
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:33,670
About all I saw was his 
hood and his beard.

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,084
And what he did to my husband.

29
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:37,437
We're gonna need your 
coat for evidence, Mr. Lindberg.

30
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:38,726
I'm due for a new one anyway.

31
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:40,949
We'll have you work with a 
sketch artist. Give me a minute?

32
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:42,465
No ID on the victim.

33
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:45,606
One of the precinct cops recognized 
her as a hooker who works...

34
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,666
9th and 10th Avenue.

35
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,895
My guess is she picked 
up the wrong john.

36
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,588
- Molloy. You Special Victims? 
- Yeah. Benson and Stabler.

37
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:54,387
Your perp piled a mound of 
garbage on the victim, lit it up.

38
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:56,318
- How much damage?
- Her back is charred.

39
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:58,247
If our house wasn't right 
around the corner...

40
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:01,122
- she'd be well done, both sides.
- Thanks, Cap.

41
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:04,955
Her genitals are mutilated, fluids 
present. Definitely one for you.

42
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:05,979
What else?

43
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:10,206
Full thickness burns to 50% 
of her body, all post mortem.

44
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,775
How can you tell?

45
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,493
He slit her throat to the spine...and 
filleted her torso from neck to genitals.

46
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:17,324
No way she survived that.

47
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:20,307
Butchered. / And barbecued.

Law & Order SVU  
2x21 Scourge

60
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:04,256
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/05/11

61
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,422
About 10:30, guy comes 
down the block...

62
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:13,971
bouncing off garbage 
cans like he's a pinball.

63
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:15,853
You see where he bounced to 
after he dropped his coat?

64
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,079
Right into my cart.
Nearly knocked it over.

65
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,193
He starts preaching to me,
I say,"Tell your story walking."

66
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:22,233
What was he preaching?

67
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,327
I don't know. Some kind 
of religious gibberish.

68
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:26,551
Once he was done with his sermon,
you see where he went?

69
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:28,388
He staggered to a 
cab parked on the corner,

70
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,844
got in. Cab headed downtown.

71
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:31,804
You ever seen him before?

72
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:34,286
No, but his hooker's  
a regular around here.

73
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:37,806
Cassie. Picked him up
coming out of that souvenir place.

74
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:40,233
Headed toward the 
alley to do their business.

75
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:43,172
Okay. The cab he got into,
you catch the plate?

76
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:47,190
- Only that it had a Y or a V.
- I'll be right back.

77
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,535
Boss says you may 
need some help. / Yeah.

78
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:52,507
Peanut man puts our 
perp outside that souvenir shop,

79
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:53,874
walks away with the victim.

80
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:56,618
We'll start there and work our 
way down the block. / Thanks.

81
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:59,654
Yeah, weird guy with a beard.

82
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:02,234
Asked for a bottle of water,
so I send him to the deli.

83
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,385
Then he spots my adult 
entertainment section.

84
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,356
What'd he do?

85
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:07,686
Picks up a magazine,
looks it over

86
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:09,001
and then rips it up.

87
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,655
Then he starts screaming about hell

88
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:12,692
and flames and how he's 
gonna smite me.

89
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:14,738
Must have been drunk or high.

90
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:17,711
So I wave this at the wacko and 
say that I'm gonna smite his sorry ass

91
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,048
up and down 9th Avenue.

92
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,537
Did he take his sorry ass out of here?

93
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:22,179
He reaches for something in his coat.

94
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,610
I smack him a few times with...
Lady Liberty here,

95
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,340
he runs out that door
whimpering like a bitch.

96
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,252
We're gonna need the magazine 
and the statue for DNA and prints.

97
00:04:31,252 --> 00:04:35,181
- That's $30 plus tax.
- Send the bill to the Mayor.

98
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:40,088
Victim's ID'd as Cassie Horner, 23...
busted numerous times for prostitution.

99
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,726
Anything more on the perp?

100
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:43,558
White, dark coat, about six feet.

101
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:45,639
Witness descriptions have 
him under the influence.

102
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,084
That level of violence, sounds like PCP.

103
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:50,477
What about the car 
that almost ran him over?

104
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:51,856
Could have saved us a lot of trouble.

105
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:53,415
Took off. Nobody got his plate number.

106
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:55,880
That leaves four people 
who got a good look at our perp.

107
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,229
Plus all the working girls who 
saw Cassie pick this guy up.

108
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:00,400
What about the labs?

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,815
Prints from the magazine he 
tore up and the peanut cart...

110
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:04,897
don't match anyone in the system.

111
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:07,362
Autopsy? / I'm on my way 
to the ME to check.

112
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:10,104
Okay. Cassie Horner 
worked 9th and 10th Avenues.

113
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,152
Pay her colleagues a visit.

114
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:15,077
Calling on courtesans.
Our specialty.

115
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:21,969
Hey, we're just standing here.
We don't want no trouble, baby.

116
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:24,800
Then how about some 
coffee after a hard night's work?

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,871
What's your name? / Honey, honey.

118
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:28,966
You giving handouts,
you must want something.

119
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,911
We're not Vice.
We're here about Cassie.

120
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,106
And since when you 
care what happens to us?

121
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:36,381
Hey, we just spent $17 of our 
own money on coffee and donuts...

122
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,940
for you and your friends. If that's 
not respect, I don't know what is.

123
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,538
They're cool, 
they wanna know about Cassie.

124
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:46,630
Isn't it past quitting time? / Slow night.

125
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,673
Well, someone ought to do that
sick bastard the way he did Cassie.

126
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:51,793
Anybody see Cassie leave 
with her last trick?

127
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:54,359
Yeah. Beard. Crazy eyes.

128
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,457
He walked over to her,
they talked a moment.

129
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:57,784
Hear what they said?

130
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,917
No. Just his name, Daniel.

131
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,135
I told Cassie 
I had a bad feeling about him.

132
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,308
She didn't heed your warning?

133
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:06,350
She laughed, said she
could take care of herself.

134
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:09,924
I wonder who's gonna 
take care of her little girl.

135
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:14,433
Had a tough time with this one, 
the way he ripped her up and burned her.

136
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,950
- What'd you find?
- Forty-two stab wounds...

137
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,120
plus the cut to the throat and 
the incision to the torso.

138
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,546
Lab found one blood 
type on the coat. The victim's.

139
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:23,835
What about the knife?

140
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:27,993
Double-edge, serrated on 
one side, 6 to 8 inches long.

141
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:30,477
Military souvenir, or collector's blade?

142
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:32,676
A killer who's a knife connoisseur.

143
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:36,338
Whatever he is, he was in a frenzy,
like some kind of fever.

144
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:39,582
Yeah. Fever that spikes at night.

145
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:45,683
We got something. / What's up?

146
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:48,374
Lab got a DNA hit from the 
sex offender database...

147
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,426
on the semen found in Cassie Horner.

148
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:52,510
Norman Fredericks, 30, on parole for rape...

149
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,746
possession with intent to sell...
living on Staten Island.

150
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:57,389
Has a job now with a contractor.

151
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,145
Palmieri's got the address of
the job he's working on now.

152
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:02,255
He grew a beard. Didn't have that 
when he was arrested.

153
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,051
He got plenty of time 
to grow one in prison.

154
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,678
Munch and Fin are almost done with
the sketch artist and the witnesses.

155
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm gonna send them as backup.

156
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,974
Can I help you? / Yeah. Police. 
We're looking for Norman Fredericks.

157
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,754
Back there.

158
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:18,705
Norm, the cops are here.

159
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:32,525
I didn't do anything!

160
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:35,342
Innocent people always run.

161
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:38,258
Norman Fredericks,
you're under arrest for murder.

162
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:41,124
Murder?  / Yeah. 
That prostitute you killed last night?

163
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:43,303
We found your DNA inside her.

164
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,272
I picked up a whore, so what?

165
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:48,801
So it's a parole violation, pal.

166
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,271
You're gonna send me
back upstate just for that?

167
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,005
We're gonna send you 
back for slicing up a hooker...

168
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,171
when you were done with her.

169
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,945
- I didn't slice up anybody.
- What time did you get home?

170
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,522
- In the door by 2:30 a.m.
- And how'd you get there?

171
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:04,403
Number one train to the Staten 
Island Ferry. Then my car.

172
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:09,446
We did our thing, I paid her and left.
I swear, I didn't...

173
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:14,058
Don't make yourself at home.
We'll be right back.

174
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:20,524
- Fredericks is a busy guy.
- What happened?

175
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:24,592
Another victim. 
Murdered last night.

176
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:28,358
People passing by all day
and no one notices...

177
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:29,960
until the roommate comes
home and finds her.

178
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,458
- Where's the roommate? 
- Bellevue Emergency.

179
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,697
She was in shock,
so we had a radio car take her in.

180
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:39,224
Fourteen years on the job,
first time I saw a body and puked.

181
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:41,121
Perp did a real number on her.

182
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,792
Oh, man. How long has she been dead?

183
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,177
At least twelve hours.

184
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:48,363
Handiwork's the same as
the last victim, only worse.

185
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:51,242
Another pro? 
Short black skirt, high heels.

186
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:54,007
He slits their throats 
so they can't scream.

187
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:58,050
Appears to be the same knife 
used on the hooker last night.

188
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:00,928
What the hell's wrong with this guy?

189
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:03,832
Thinks he's Jack The Ripper.

190
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,241
You should have called me.

191
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:10,714
We thought we'd see 
if we had a case first.

192
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:11,829
When my bosses tell me that

193
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:14,897
you guys have a suspect and I don't already
know that, I look like an idiot.

194
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:18,883
Alex, you know better than to think  
that I would keep you out of the loop.

195
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,120
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just two women ripped apart...

196
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,278
within 24 hours by the same perp,
and everybody's edgy.

197
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,750
- We ready for a lineup yet?
- No, it's premature until we're done...

198
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,375
canvassing the second murder scene.

199
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,500
Do you have an ID on that victim yet?

200
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,286
Theresa Folsom, 24, she's 
a publicist for a publishing house.

201
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:36,211
- This is for her roommate.
- She give you anything?

202
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:38,011
You'll be the first to know.

203
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:40,372
Milk only, no sugar, right?

204
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:42,802
Thank you.

205
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:47,045
We know this is difficult for you.

206
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,396
When's the last time you saw Theresa?

207
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:51,789
Last night. I mean, early this morning.

208
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:54,448
We were club-hopping 
with some friends.

209
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,583
Terry got tired, so we...

210
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:06,579
Sorry, we put her in a cab at 
6th Street and Avenue B.

211
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:07,737
What time?

212
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:11,331
Around midnight. 
We partied a little bit more, and...

213
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:13,892
I crashed at my boyfriend's.

214
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,309
Book publicists don't 
make a lot of money.

215
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,549
Do you know if Theresa was 
doing any moonlighting?

216
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:19,978
What do you mean?

217
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:23,447
Well, maybe she made some 
extra cash by entertaining men.

218
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:26,723
My best friend is dead
I don't need to hear this crap.

219
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:30,120
No disrespect intended.
We have to ask.

220
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,423
- It's part of our job.
- Terry has a boyfriend...

221
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,107
Had a boyfriend in Boston.

222
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:43,712
She wasn't promiscuous,
and she'd never pick up a guy.

223
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:49,312
Theresa Folsom's squeaky clean. 
No record, not even a traffic ticket.

224
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:50,387
Fredericks giving you trouble?

225
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:52,924
No, just keeping an eye on him.
What did he tell you?

226
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:55,495
That he didn't get home
until 2:30 this morning.

227
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:58,484
ME says Folsom was killed sometime
between midnight and 1:00 a.m.

228
00:10:58,484 --> 00:10:59,972
He picks up Cassie Horner,

229
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:02,688
finishes her off, 
cabs it down to the East Village...

230
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:05,306
kills Theresa, with plenty 
of time to make the 1:30 ferry...

231
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:08,432
- back to Staten Island.
- Fredericks isn't our guy.

232
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:09,399
Based on what?

233
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,228
Lab found two different blood types...
at the last murder scene,

234
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:16,101
Terry Folsom's and probably the killer's.
Neither matches Fredericks.

235
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:20,097
Okay. So we book him on the parole
violation for soliciting a prostitute.

236
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,949
And go back to looking 
for the getaway cab.

237
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:24,754
If this guy's a serial killer, he might
have been active somewhere else.

238
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:26,779
Check Vi-CAP for any similar MO's.

239
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:30,544
I'm gonna call Huang,
see if he can't give us a profile.

240
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:34,194
He comes out at night...
and focuses his rage at prostitutes

241
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,862
and women that he...
believes to be prostitutes.

242
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,312
- Just like London, 1888.
- Not Jack the Ripper again.

243
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:43,366
Ripperologists are convinced that...
his Royal Highness,

244
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:45,604
Prince Albert Victor,
committed the deeds.

245
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,167
And I understand the royal 
family is still smarting over that...

246
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,180
- but could we please continue?
- Actually, Captain, our guy...

247
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,433
may be a wannabe. Especially
if he's a paranoid-schizophrenic.

248
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:55,930
How do you explain the fire?

249
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,800
Well, your witnesses say that he 
talked of hell fire and damnation.

250
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,689
Maybe he thought that
the victims were the devil.

251
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,198
He didn't torch the second woman.

252
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:05,567
Well, maybe he heard
footsteps and ran off.

253
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,711
Some witnesses reported that 
he seemed drunk or high.

254
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:10,199
Well, some schizophrenics
self-medicate with alcohol.

255
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,742
So who we looking for, Doc?

256
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:15,336
A man mentally ill since 
childhood or early adulthood.

257
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:17,411
Could possibly have been
institutionalized.

258
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:20,156
Not able to keep a job. 
Lives alone.

259
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,712
Strong religious delusions.

260
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:25,094
And he might have 
command hallucinations.

261
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,857
Voices telling him to kill.

262
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:30,571
He's impulsive, disorganized, unpredictable.

263
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,028
And he's not gonna stop
until you catch him.

264
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,241
Better make it soon.

265
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,360
The press is already 
calling him the "Night Ripper."

266
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,342
- We've gotta release the sketch.
- That would be a mistake.

267
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:44,766
If people are gonna panic, at least
give them something to panic about.

268
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,602
The publicity's just gonna 
excite him more.

269
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:50,202
I think he's awful excited
right now without publicity.

270
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:52,026
We'll consider releasing the sketch.

271
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:53,786
Meanwhile, I want every vice unit
out warning the working girls to be...

272
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:57,527
watching out for this guy.
Where are we on the cabs?

273
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,060
We've narrowed it down to 12 possibles,

274
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,282
before we got sidetracked with Fredericks.

275
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,262
Run them down.

276
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,038
Marcus, pick up line six.

277
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:07,729
No, there's nothing with a Y in the 
number on the street last night.

278
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,954
Okay. How about your V cabs?

279
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:14,780
Well, we only have two.
Let me look here... Wait.

280
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:20,507
Wait a minute. Here it is.
5-V-42. Ran 9:00 pm to 9:00 am.

281
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,685
Driver didn't even make 
enough to cover his lease.

282
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,151
Okay, any pickups 
around 44th and 9th?

283
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,981
Uh, not according to his trip sheet.

284
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,696
- Can I take a look at that?
- Be my guest.

285
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,331
Take a look at this.

286
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,548
The driver put 82 miles on the car and
only logged jobs for maybe half of that.

287
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:41,501
So he didn't drop the 
meter on all of his fares.

288
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,512
This driver.You have a 
name and address for him?

289
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:46,930
Yeah. Sure. No problem.
I'll get it for you.

290
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,348
APARTMENT OF SEKOU OBENG
1815 AMSTERDAM AVENUE
WEDNESDAY, MAY 2

291
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:51,149
Last night when you 
were driving your cab...

292
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:54,419
did you pick up a fare
on 44th and 9th Avenue?

293
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:55,535
No.

294
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,775
You sure? You didn't log more 
than half your jobs on your trip sheet.

295
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:00,840
What are you talking about?

296
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,859
Maybe you forgot to drop the meter

297
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:05,410
keep a little more money
for your family?

298
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:13,555
- I wasn't driving.
- Okay. Who was?

299
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,304
My cousin. Nkrumah?

300
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:22,981
I pick up the cab, let him drive.

301
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:26,062
Make some money for 
his family back home.

302
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:28,806
He pick up the man
you're looking for.

303
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:31,794
- What's your name?
- Kabral Nkrumah.

304
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:33,338
Did you see his face?

305
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:35,638
And his bloody clothes.

306
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:37,061
He scared me.

307
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:40,991
Police car drove by, he lowered his 
head so they would not see him.

308
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,574
Okay. Can you describe him?

309
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:47,185
Medium height...
wild eyes. Wild eyes.

310
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,843
- Bushy beard.
- Where did you take him?

311
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,847
3rd Street and Avenue D.

312
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,520
Paid me with a bloody $20 bill.

313
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,319
- Didn't wait for change.
- We're gonna need that bill.

314
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,117
Oh, I spent it.

315
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:04,289
We're gonna need to get that cab to 
CSU before it goes out for the night.

316
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:07,472
Find anything? / Yeah, 
we vacuumed for hairs and fibers.

317
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:10,421
Just getting ready to look for blood.
Let me light it up.

318
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:11,912
If the guy had victim's 
blood on his coat,

319
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,977
he must've gotten some on his hands.

320
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:17,385
Munch. / Or he slipped and cut
himself, left us some evidence.

321
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:20,304
Look, blood. I'll lift it 
and get it to the lab.

322
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:22,035
Yeah. We'll be right there. 
Gotta go. / What?

323
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:24,110
Jack strikes again.

324
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,458
I'm washing my hands,
the kid is at the urinal.

325
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,870
Guy comes in and 
starts screaming about

326
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,381
the machines controlling the boy's mind...

327
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:36,588
pulls out a knife, slits 
his throat. Just like that.

328
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:38,945
- Did he go after you next?
- I went after him,

329
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:41,734
tried to grab the knife.
He got me in the stomach.

330
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:44,358
- That's when the boy's father comes in.
- What happened?

331
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:46,205
He never saw the guy with the knife.

332
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,450
He runs straight for his kid, 
starts screaming.

333
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,745
I'm yelling at him about the knife...

334
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,446
then the guy slices his neck.
I couldn't do nothing!

335
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:56,915
- You did plenty. Take it easy.
- We're gonna ride with him.

336
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,831
- Yeah. All right. 
- What took you so long?

337
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,083
We were in Queens.
We found the cab driver.

338
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,502
Huang is on his way.

339
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:05,589
Says he can profile more 
accurately if he's on the scene.

340
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,430
- Radio said two victims?
- Well, almost three.

341
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,590
Good Samaritan got stabbed
in the gut trying to stop him.

342
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,417
Who's she?

343
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:18,757
This is Jean Weston. It's her 
husband and son cut up in there.

344
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,931
Tourists. / I thought  
he was targeting pros.

345
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:24,734
How old's the kid?  /  Nine.

346
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,194
Son of a bitch.

347
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:32,014
Mrs. Weston, I'm Detective Stabler.

348
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:37,211
Josh just wanted to play video games.

349
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:40,086
We're going back to 
Oregon tomorrow morning.

350
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:41,800
I have to go pack.

351
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,033
Okay, I'll tell you what.
We're gonna have the officer take you...

352
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:48,476
to the hospital first and just 
have you checked out.

353
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,391
Okay?

354
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,462
Got him in the left carotid.

355
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:09,316
He probably lived about two
minutes before he bled out.

356
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:10,839
Same knife?

357
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:13,676
Yeah.

358
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:21,089
Four victims within 24 hours.

359
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,596
Three in the theater district,
Times Square area...

360
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:25,178
one in the East Village.

361
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:28,946
And a serial killer we can't profile 
because he strikes at random.

362
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:30,415
It doesn't get much worse than this.

363
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:34,224
Nobody is safe until we 
collar this guy. Chief Sullivan?

364
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:37,303
The city is terrified, and the public 
doesn't give a rat's ass how much...

365
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,493
we brought crime down as
long as this guy is out there.

366
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:42,548
I want to thank all of you 
who came in on your own time.

367
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:45,242
Clock in. We need 
all the help we can get.

368
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:48,732
Captain Cragen runs the task 
force and reports directly to me.

369
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:52,705
The phone bank is being set up, 
with the reward up to $100,000.

370
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:56,077
We're gonna be flooded with tips
We investigate every one.

371
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,012
You have your assignments.
Let's find this guy.

372
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,014
What'd you get?

373
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,519
Canvass, Avenue D.

374
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,735
Canvass on Avenue C.

375
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:07,848
I'm Avenue B. You're Avenue A, 
I guess.

376
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:11,157
Palmieri's taking Avenue A. 
Anything from Vi-CAP?

377
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,551
Nobody active fitting our guy.

378
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,820
Yeah. That would've been too easy.

379
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,776
John, before you hit the streets,
I want you to get an update from the ME.

380
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:20,640
- Okay, Boss. See you guys later.
- All right. / - Set?

381
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:24,336
I want you coordinating the 
phone tips and the assignments.

382
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,350
Our case, then why am I being benched?

383
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,974
I need somebody I can trust
in charge while I tap-dance for the bosses.

384
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:33,717
Nobody sweats the details like you.

385
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,973
Okay. Go get him.

386
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:39,825
- Detective Stabler.
- Mrs. Weston.

387
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:41,654
I said you were busy.

388
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:45,053
We're closing on our new house
next week. I have to get home.

389
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:47,220
Mrs. Weston, do you have any relatives

390
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,618
or friends in New York 
you can stay with?

391
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:52,678
I don't know anyone here.

392
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:56,870
I don't... / Elliott. Phone call.

393
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:01,601
Mrs. Weston, this is 
Detective Palmieri. Right here.

394
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:04,553
He's gonna get you coffee,
food, whatever you want.

395
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:06,530
I'll be with you in just a minute, okay?

396
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:09,058
See if you can find a family member.

397
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:12,163
Okay. Why don't you come with me?

398
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:22,014
Special Victims, 
Detective... Hey, Kathy.

399
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,950
No. It's just good to hear your voice.

400
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:28,865
The unidentified blood at the 
second murder scene and the blood...

401
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:31,511
CSU got from the cab 
are the same type. AB.

402
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:34,041
Which puts our man at the first 
two scenes. We won the trifecta.

403
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,442
We found only the victim's
blood at the arcade,

404
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,897
but take a look at these.
You know Locard's theory?

405
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,324
Transfer evidence.
Everywhere you go

406
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:42,150
you pick something up 
and leave something behind.

407
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,049
Seven years in Homicide,
I better know it.

408
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,009
CSU took this from inside the 
perp's coat found in the garbage can.

409
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,065
This was on the body of Terry Folsom...

410
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,092
and this was in the pooled blood 
next to Josh and Jeremy Weston.

411
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,300
Consistent blends.
Some kind of spun fiber.

412
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,387
Ran it through the gas chromatograph.
It's a 60-40 cotton wool blend.

413
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:02,023
I'm a summer weight
wool-gabardine man myself.

414
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:06,068
Your perp wore the same piece of 
clothing when he killed all four victims.

415
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:08,993
Thanks.

416
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,383
Forget the canvass.

417
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:15,461
We got a disturbance in 
Washington Square Park.

418
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:19,698
A suspect in the murders is being 
held by civilians. Let's get there now.

419
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,770
Special Victims. Excuse me! Police.

420
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,026
- Coming through. Excuse me.
- Show's over!  / Excuse me.

421
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,438
Bus is on the way along 
with the rest of our backup.

422
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:27,823
What the hell happened here?

423
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:30,771
Someone heard this guy accost 
a pro over on 4th Street,

424
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,678
spouting something about Armageddon.
Next thing, a dozen people

425
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:37,684
they chase him in here,
and they kick the crap out of him.

426
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:38,852
He's not even close.

427
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:42,802
Okay, people. Look at this.
This is our man. Beard and hair.

428
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:46,004
- This man has no beard and no hair.
- Bastard shaved it off!

429
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:48,630
- Yeah! 
- Tried to kill another whore!

430
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,943
Who's gonna be next?

431
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:52,695
Get outta here or both you are going
in for assault, all right? All of you.

432
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:55,128
Hang in there, all right?
The ambulance is on its way.

433
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,246
Just take it easy, okay?

434
00:20:57,938 --> 00:21:00,406
These people have a serious problem.

435
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:02,247
Yeah, they're scared.

436
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:07,004
Hey. / Hey, you survived riot duty.

437
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,050
Hope you had better luck than we did.

438
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,361
How's it going?

439
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:14,221
Five hundred calls since 11:00,
more sightings than Elvis.

440
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,906
Anyone wanna trade places?

441
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,407
No thanks. We're just too 
busy waiting for him to strike again.

442
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:22,725
Look, it's 4:00. Why don't you 
guys catch some shut-eye?

443
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:25,291
Don't have to ask me twice.

444
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,207
Not at home, in the crib.

445
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:38,374
You, too. / Oh, no.
I'm too pissed to sleep.

446
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:40,634
You want some help?

447
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,870
I'm not gonna say no.

448
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,403
"Spotted on Broadway."

449
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:56,120
"It looks like the subway
token clerk at 68th and Lex."

450
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:58,883
"He's my night doorman."

451
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,595
I know you're working 
off some nervous energy...

452
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:03,207
but you don't have to
read every one of them out loud.

453
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:08,520
Aren't we in a mood?

454
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:16,688
You know, it's the middle of 
the night, and I'm sitting here

455
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:20,822
realizing I spend more time with 
you than I do with my own family...

456
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,263
No offense.

457
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:25,606
We both need a vacation.

458
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:28,880
You got that right.

459
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:34,957
Wait a minute. 
Here's one with a guy...

460
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:38,726
says somebody gave him a check 
with bloody fingerprints on it.

461
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,023
Where?

462
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:44,655
I didn't take it. Counterman did.

463
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,381
Did you see who cashed it?

464
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:48,715
I was slicing prosciutto in the back.

465
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:51,534
I assume it was Mrs.Varney.
It's her check.

466
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:52,857
Hold on. I'll get it.

467
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:54,513
It's in the top.

468
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:59,875
Check is issued out to Cash.
Name on the check, Paula Varney.

469
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:03,523
APARTMENT OF PAULA VARNEY
70 WASHINGTON PLACE
THURSDAY, MAY 3

470
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:08,610
I gave this check to my husband.

471
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,222
- Did something happen to him?
- No, we just want to speak with him.

472
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,066
- Has he left for work?
- Daniel doesn't live here.

473
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:17,754
Girls, run upstairs and get dressed, 
okay? We're gonna be late.

474
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:20,026
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

475
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:24,595
The day before yesterday,
when I gave him the check.

476
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:27,035
- I help support him.
- You're divorced?

477
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:32,401
Separated, it's hard to explain.
Daniel's had some problems.

478
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:34,612
What kind of problems?

479
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:38,153
Three years ago, 
he started losing it.

480
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:42,191
He got fired from his job.
I had to start teaching again.

481
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,698
We didn't get divorced so Daniel could
stay on my medical insurance.

482
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:48,157
Not that he would see a doctor.

483
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:53,309
Mrs. Varney, is this your husband?

484
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,207
Oh, my God.

485
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:58,359
It is urgent that we speak with him.

486
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:04,100
Our priest gave him a small 
room in a rectory of our church.

487
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,215
What is this about?

488
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:08,935
Has he done something?

489
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:10,147
Hurt someone?

490
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:12,894
Well, we're not quite sure yet.

491
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:19,057
He's a janitor at the church.
Our Lady of Lourdes.

492
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:21,887
Thanks.

493
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:27,512
Judge signed the warrant. Munch and Fin 
are on their way to toss Varney's room.

494
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,049
Trimmed his beard.

495
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,766
Look at his hands.

496
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:42,660
Daniel?

497
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:49,183
- Yes, I'm Daniel. 
- Hi. Can we talk to you a second?

498
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:53,095
- Who are you?  
- We're the police.

499
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:56,667
His avenging angels cometh.

500
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,368
We just want to ask you a question.

501
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:01,481
Presence of the Lord.
You cannot, you cannot hide.

502
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:03,343
You cannot hide in the
presence of the Lord.

503
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:04,607
He sent you to judge me?

504
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:07,879
No, not to judge you.
To help you.

505
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:10,723
Why? I served him.

506
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:13,976
I saw that they were unclean and
I cleansed them in their own blood.

507
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:16,338
I saved a child,
a lamb that was pure.

508
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:20,938
Daniel, come with us.
Come with us.

509
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,758
Wasn't I good enough?
Wasn't I good enough?

510
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:23,422
Why do you send your angels for me?

511
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,289
Why do you want to destroy me
when I bring them your message?

512
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:28,914
I saw that they were unclean.

513
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:30,548
Why do you send your angels for me?

514
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:33,929
Why? Why do you wantto destroy me
when I... bring them your message?

515
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:38,211
No. Not to destroy you.
He wants to reward you.

516
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:39,684
He will judge me!

517
00:25:39,684 --> 00:25:41,201
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

518
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:42,898
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

519
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:44,733
- on earth as it is in Heaven.
- As it is in Heaven.

520
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,613
Give us this dayour daily bread

521
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:50,156
And forgive us our trespasses

522
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:54,178
- Pray with me!  / Yeah.
- Got it.

523
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,743
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

524
00:25:55,743 --> 00:26:00,326
Daniel Varney. You're under 
arrest for murder. / Amen.

525
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:04,068
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up that right...

526
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:06,562
whatever you say can and will be 
used against you in a court of law.

527
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:09,110
My God! / You have 
the right to an attorney.

528
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:34,597
Who are you?

529
00:26:35,336 --> 00:26:37,673
Detective Benson.

530
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,662
I need to ask you a few questions.

531
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:49,615
About what?

532
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:53,996
About what you did to
those four people.

533
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:59,009
I was following orders.

534
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:00,132
From who?

535
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:04,242
From the Lord God almighty,
who is in heaven...

536
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:08,038
sent through his messenger.

537
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:12,183
- What messenger, Daniel?
- An angel who came to me...

538
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:14,793
and told me to cleanse them.

539
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:20,717
- I have to ask you something. 
- What?

540
00:27:20,717 --> 00:27:23,569
Why didn't you shoot me?

541
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:26,228
Because I didn't want to hurt you.

542
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,779
But you must.

543
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:32,511
I must what, Daniel?
I don't understand.

544
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:35,984
Kill me, please.

545
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:39,868
Please, I can't take any more pain.

546
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:50,220
We better put him on a suicide watch.

547
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:57,963
ME says Varney's knife matches
the wounds on all four victims.

548
00:27:57,963 --> 00:27:59,886
Anything from John and Fin?

549
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,699
They're on their way to the lab with 
bloody clothes from Varney's room.

550
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:05,020
Found them hanging in the closet

551
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,976
like he just brought them
back from the cleaners.

552
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,296
Good enough for me.
Type up those reports.

553
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:11,451
Let's get him into court.

554
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:15,443
ARRAIGNMENT COURT
TRIAL PART 43
FRIDAY, MAY 4

555
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:17,754
Docket number 3-5-2-1-4...

556
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:19,826
People vs. Daniel Stephen Varney.

557
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:22,473
Charges are four counts
murder in the first degree...

558
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:25,502
one count assault in the first degree.

559
00:28:25,635 --> 00:28:28,746
I trust, Miss Cabot, the People have
met their burden for murder one?

560
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:29,584
Yes, Your Honor.

561
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:32,842
The defendant mutilated and killed
four people in under 48 hours.

562
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:35,487
Their blood was found on clothing 
in Mr. Varney's apartment.

563
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:36,866
Very well.

564
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,920
Mr. Newvine, 
how does your client plead?

565
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,108
Are you God?

566
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,642
Just an over worked judge,
Mr. Varney,

567
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,709
and I ask the questions, not you.

568
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,648
Guilty or not guilty?

569
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:53,036
How can you judge me
if you're not God?

570
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:56,947
Mr. Newvine, control your client.

571
00:28:57,057 --> 00:29:00,841
We plead not guilty by reason 
of mental disease or defect, Your Honor.

572
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:03,924
- Daniel, please.  
- Miss Cabot?

573
00:29:03,924 --> 00:29:07,804
Remand, Your Honor.
The defendant is clearly a...  /  No!

574
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:11,889
- You can't judge me!
- No! No!

575
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,064
- You can't judge me!  
- Order! Order!

576
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:16,134
You don't sit in judgment of me!

577
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:18,736
- You don't sit in judgment of me!
- No, he can't help it, he's sick.

578
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:21,553
- You can't touch me! 
- He can't help it! He's sick!

579
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:26,398
- You can't judge me! You can't judge me!
- He can't help it! He can't help it!

580
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,797
He's sick! I'm sorry! 
I'm sorry. I'm so...

581
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:33,908
Miss Cabot.

582
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:36,372
- Miss Cabot, you want to kill him. 
- Mrs. Varney, I can't talk to you.

583
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:38,351
Please, don't kill him.

584
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,481
Do you want justice or 
are you just gonna swing...

585
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:42,298
whatever way public opinion blows you?

586
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:44,174
Mrs. Varney, please.

587
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:47,175
He was a loving husband,
a good father...

588
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,316
He murdered four people.

589
00:29:49,316 --> 00:29:52,261
Taking his life won't bring them back.

590
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:56,503
I know I have to live with what he did,
and our girls have to grow up...

591
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,982
knowing that he killed those people...

592
00:29:57,982 --> 00:30:01,333
But I have to speak for the victims...
and for their families,

593
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,014
and follow the law.

594
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:05,625
Doesn't the law protect Daniel, too?

595
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:08,651
He didn't know what
he was doing. He's sick.

596
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:10,255
Mrs. Varney, a terrible thing happened

597
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:14,418
to you and your family and 
I am sympathetic... / The hell you are!

598
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:17,981
You put murderers and rapists 
back on the street every day.

599
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:21,172
He didn't even know
he was doing anything wrong.

600
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:25,279
Please, Miss Cabot.

601
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,735
I'm sorry.

602
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,580
We're seeking the death penalty.

603
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,118
Daniel belongs in a psychiatric
hospital, not on death row.

604
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:44,727
- That's for a jury to decide.
- He's not competent to stand trial.

605
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:45,972
He attacked me.

606
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:47,880
All that proves is that he's violent.

607
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,598
Spontaneously violent.
No impulse control.

608
00:30:51,598 --> 00:30:54,714
Your client solicited a prostitute
and lured her into an alley way

609
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:55,639
before he mutilated her.

610
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,574
He threw his bloody coat out.

611
00:30:57,574 --> 00:31:00,030
He ducked down in the cab so
the police wouldn't see him.

612
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,539
He knew exactly what he was doing.

613
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:03,829
How are you feeling, Daniel?

614
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,871
My head won't stop hurting.

615
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:09,582
We'll give you something for the pain.

616
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,455
- Were you angry at your attorney?
- I don't have an attorney.

617
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:17,328
You hit him in court.

618
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,797
Why was I in court?

619
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:22,731
Because of what you 
did to those people.

620
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:30,062
I killed them. God said I had to.

621
00:31:33,005 --> 00:31:35,545
"You are my messenger."

622
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:41,835
"The unclean must be cleansed,
or I will serve my wrath upon you!"

623
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:44,439
But the Bible says,
"Thou shalt not kill."

624
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:48,626
He said I must eliminate the evil.

625
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:51,132
That little boy was evil?

626
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:57,109
The video games put 
evil thoughts in his head.

627
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:59,737
I had to save him.

628
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:03,560
I didn't want to kill a little boy.

629
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,620
He said I had to.

630
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,221
I had to.

631
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,634
I had to...

632
00:32:31,013 --> 00:32:34,861
Alex, your office said you were here.

633
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,768
DA just signed the papers to seek 
the death penalty against Varney.

634
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:39,646
He can't stand trial.

635
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:41,168
What are you saying?

636
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,907
He's not competent.

637
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:45,060
He knows what he did was wrong.

638
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,433
The man is a serial killer.

639
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:49,562
Who doesn't fit any profile
that I can come up with.

640
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:50,726
You saw him at Bellevue.

641
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:52,993
He doesn't even remember
slugging his attorney.

642
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:55,414
We've convicted schizophrenics
and psychotics before.

643
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:59,199
Schizophrenia usually strikes 
young adults and teenagers.

644
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:01,114
Daniel Varney may 
appear to be psychotic...

645
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:03,907
but his loss of memory suggests 
something else is going on.

646
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:07,327
- What? 
- Organic dementia.

647
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:09,125
A disease attacking his brain.

648
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:15,256
Mini-strokes, early onset Alzheimer's,
a brain tumor, something.

649
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:18,371
Do you know how much pressure
I am under to convict this man?

650
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,111
He butchers four innocent people.
He scares the hell out of the city.

651
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:24,020
The public wants justice.

652
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,308
- What can we do?
- A complete workup.

653
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:30,645
Labs, MRI, LP.

654
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:33,985
And I need your detectives
to get his medical records.

655
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:38,326
- What is it you want? 
- Your help.

656
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:40,903
I'm not helping you kill my husband.

657
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:43,835
Girls, go up to your room and play.

658
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,663
Do you have children,
Detective Benson?

659
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:50,539
No, I don't.

660
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:54,837
Have you ever lost anyone close to you?

661
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:58,419
Yes, I have. Earlier this year,
I lost my mother.

662
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:01,193
Then you know how it feels.

663
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,032
When you lose a parent
as an adult, it's hard enough.

664
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:07,065
Can you imagine what my 
girls are going through?

665
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:09,420
Mrs. Varney, please, understand that...

666
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,841
we are not trying to make this 
any worse than it already is...

667
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,670
You want to execute my husband.

668
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:20,769
We already lost him once.
I can't face losing him again.

669
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:25,819
What did you come here for?

670
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,589
Your husband's medical records.

671
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:29,458
Why?

672
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:33,633
To see if there's anything that 
can help explain what he did.

673
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:41,700
I'll never understand.

674
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:45,246
I'll never understand.

675
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:54,192
Daniel was the gentlest man 
I'd ever known.

676
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,231
Then he started to change.

677
00:34:56,231 --> 00:35:00,053
I begged him to see a doctor.
He refused.

678
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:03,411
Even our priest couldn't
convince him to get help.

679
00:35:03,957 --> 00:35:07,027
One night, I woke up.

680
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:09,779
I found Daniel standing in the girls' room...

681
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:13,551
holding a knife, crying.

682
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:18,137
He said life was so hopeless...

683
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:21,397
he wanted to spare them the pain.

684
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:29,325
Do you care about any of this?

685
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:33,557
You have to trust me.

686
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,511
We finished going through his records.

687
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:41,593
Varney's medical history
ends three years ago...

688
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:44,551
which is about the time that his 
wife says his bizarre behavior began.

689
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,010
Anything noteworthy?

690
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,810
Aside from his high blood 
pressure, this guy was healthy.

691
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,419
- The labs are back.
- What'd you find?

692
00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:53,778
Advanced syphilis.

693
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,725
How advanced?

694
00:35:56,725 --> 00:36:00,364
Tertiary stage. The MRI shows
cortical degeneration and atrophy.

695
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:03,531
- Meaning what?
- His brain is Swiss cheese.

696
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,877
The syphilis has eaten 
away at his cerebral cortex.

697
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:08,828
The moral center of his brain
is long gone.

698
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:11,194
We've got to tell his wife.

699
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:14,158
He's already been given
a death sentence, Alex.

700
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:17,917
We've given him penicillin,
but the damage is done.

701
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:20,520
He's not gonna recover.

702
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:27,971
BELLEVUE HOSPITAL CENTER
PRISON UNIT
MONDAY, MAY 7

703
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,065
They said I could see him.

704
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:32,574
Have the doctors talked to you yet?

705
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,485
What about?

706
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:39,747
You were right, Mrs. Varney.

707
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:42,694
It wasn't your husband's fault.

708
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:46,672
Mrs. Varney, your husband has syphilis.

709
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:52,455
- Oh, my God.
- It's destroyed his brain.

710
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:57,016
Well, what does that mean?
What about my daughters?

711
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:59,554
What about me? 
We've been married for ten years.

712
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:00,672
You'll have to be tested,

713
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:03,248
but our doctor says that
it's only contagious...

714
00:37:03,248 --> 00:37:05,375
in the early stages.

715
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,276
Your husband's case is so advanced...

716
00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:10,953
that he probably picked it up
long before you even met.

717
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:14,717
I don't understand.
How could no one find this?

718
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:17,291
He's been to doctors,
he had an insurance physical...

719
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,502
- Medical insurance?
- Life insurance.

720
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,235
Seven years ago,

721
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:24,365
when our first daughter was born.

722
00:37:24,365 --> 00:37:27,452
- Was he approved?  
- No.

723
00:37:27,964 --> 00:37:31,184
Well, did the insurance 
company ever tell you why?

724
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:35,913
We thought it had to do 
with his hypertension.

725
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:37,601
Mrs. Varney, if you ask
the insurance company...

726
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:41,051
why your husband was rejected, 
they have to tell you.

727
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:44,483
- Does it really matter now?
- Yes. It really matters.

728
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:47,476
You've got to request those records.

729
00:37:59,018 --> 00:38:00,713
I missed you.

730
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:03,487
Hi, honey. Me, too.

731
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:07,393
- The girls miss their daddy.
- How are they?

732
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:10,906
They're fine. How are you?

733
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:15,134
It hurts so much.

734
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:20,062
I'm sorry.

735
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,493
Paula Varney got an answer
from All-Atlantic Life.

736
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:39,238
They knew that he had syphilis.

737
00:38:39,238 --> 00:38:40,919
Bastards never informed him.

738
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,929
Communicable, sexually 
transmitted disease,

739
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:45,451
company's required to report that 
to the health department.

740
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:48,999
And health department would have 
notified Varney if they'd known.

741
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:51,542
One shot of penicillin back then 
could have cured him.

742
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,400
And these four victim
swould still be alive.

743
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,118
Yeah, if the insurance
company had told them!

744
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:58,727
I want their ass.

745
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:04,900
OFFICE OF MALCOLM HUNT CEO
ALL-ATLANTIC LIFE
INSURANCE COMPANY
TUESDAY, MAY 8

746
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,301
- What is this?   
- Malcolm Hunt?

747
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:11,282
- And who are you?  
- Police.

748
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,898
Come up from behind the desk, please.

749
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,268
I don't take orders from you.

750
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,076
Malcolm Hunt, you're under 
arrest for reckless endangerment.

751
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:18,951
Reckless endangerment? 
For what?

752
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:22,888
For failing to notify the health department 
about an applicant's communicable disease

753
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:24,905
which caused him to murder four people.

754
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,217
How dare you walk in here 
and accuse me...

755
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:28,612
Your lawyer can explain it to you.

756
00:39:28,612 --> 00:39:31,229
No, you're the ones who can explain.
On whose authority?

757
00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:32,955
We have a warrant, signed by a judge.

758
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,243
And if you don't come with 
us voluntarily, we'll take you.

759
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,149
Now please put your 
hands behind your back.

760
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:39,080
Is this necessary?

761
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,187
Standard procedure.

762
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:42,935
You have the right to remain silent.

763
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:44,327
If you give up that right,
anything you say

764
00:39:44,327 --> 00:39:47,691
can and will beused against 
youin a court of law.

765
00:39:47,805 --> 00:39:50,922
You need a head to mount on your wall

766
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,938
so my client becomes the scapegoat.

767
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:56,175
We checked with the 
health department.

768
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:59,511
You never reported Daniel Varney's 
syphilis as required by law...

769
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:00,933
It must have slipped 
through the cracks.

770
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:04,563
It's the applicant's responsibility 
to ask why he was rejected.

771
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,362
Who's responsible for the 
four people he murdered

772
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,982
because you didn't tell him?

773
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:10,817
We reject thousands of 
applicants every year.

774
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:13,874
- HIV, heart disease.
- All poor risks.

775
00:40:13,874 --> 00:40:16,293
Miss Cabot, we run a business.

776
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,892
We answer to our stockholders.

777
00:40:18,892 --> 00:40:23,206
Providing explanations to 
every applicant we turn down

778
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:25,631
would require hiring more staff

779
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,029
premiums would go through 
the roof, and fewer people

780
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:31,542
could afford life insurance.

781
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:34,671
$1.50 worth of penicillin would 
have cured Daniel Varney...

782
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:37,455
and prevented the carnage he caused.

783
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:38,757
You should have told him.

784
00:40:38,757 --> 00:40:42,674
The Court of Appeals just ruled that 
we are under no obligation to inform the...

785
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:47,438
The applicant. You still have to notify 
the appropriate health department.

786
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:50,077
If we audit your records and
find a pattern of similar cases

787
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:51,257
that have "slipped through the cracks"

788
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:54,799
with no effort on the part of your 
company to rectify the situation,

789
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:57,302
not only will we charge Mr. Hunt
with reckless endangerment,

790
00:40:57,302 --> 00:41:01,147
we will move to seize the profits of 
your company as assets to the crime.

791
00:41:01,147 --> 00:41:02,635
See how your stockholders like that.

792
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:07,659
You can't do that... / And Mr. Hunt can sit 
in prison for seven years and think about it.

793
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,932
What do you want, Miss Cabot?

794
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:18,048
I want your company to begin reporting 
all cases of communicable diseases.

795
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:21,470
And when the families of the murder 
victims and Daniel Varney's wife sue...

796
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,368
you'll settle.

797
00:41:23,368 --> 00:41:26,498
That's extortion. It would 
cost the company millions.

798
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:30,010
It'll cost a lot less than going
bankrupt because of the publicity.

799
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,933
In the court of public opinion,
you're already guilty.

800
00:41:32,933 --> 00:41:36,221
Do you want to take your
chances in a real court?

801
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:46,887
SENTNCING HEARING
TRIAL PART 74
TUESDAY, MAY 8

802
00:41:47,898 --> 00:41:50,614
I've read the 37 report 
on your client, Mr. Newvine.

803
00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:53,221
Do you wish to introduce
any other evidence?

804
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:56,692
No, Your Honor.

805
00:41:56,903 --> 00:42:00,753
Miss Cabot, does the District 
Attorney plan to contest the findings?

806
00:42:00,753 --> 00:42:02,203
Not at this time, Your Honor.

807
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,585
The People are satisfied
with the doctor's report.

808
00:42:04,585 --> 00:42:07,996
Then I rule the defendant
Daniel Stephen Varney...

809
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:10,325
not competent to assist
in his own defense...

810
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:13,118
therefore unfit to proceed to trial.

811
00:42:13,118 --> 00:42:16,777
I order him remanded to the custody 
of the Office of Mental Health...

812
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:22,367
to be placed in a secure psychiatric 
facility until he is fit to proceed.

813
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:24,356
This court is adjourned.

814
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:27,511
Until he's fit to proceed.

815
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,508
Which is never.

816
