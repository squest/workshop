2
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,189
In the criminal justice system,

3
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,833
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,435
In New York City,

5
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,681
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

6
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,752
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

7
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:38,829
These are their stories.

8
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,480
- Yes, I am! 
- No! You're not!

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,200
Shut up, you witch!

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,375
What the hell are you doing, 
going through my things for?

11
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,654
You're a liar! You said 
you'd never do that again!

12
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,346
This is the last time, 
you creep.

13
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:02,020
I can't wait till you die, 
so I can spit on your corpse, you freak!

14
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,228
No. No. No!

15
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,362
Come here.

16
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,133
You want to talk?

17
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,313
Let go of me.

18
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:21,081
SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT 
SQUAD ROOM 
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25

19
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,357
Think of your body 
as part of the crime scene.

20
00:01:23,357 --> 00:01:26,123
Time and body fluids 
erode evidence.

21
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:28,965
The procedure is we head 
to the hospital,

22
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,317
and then 
I'll take your statement.

23
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:33,608
So basically the bastard rapes me, 
and you waste time.

24
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,664
- That's the procedure? 
- Ma'am...

25
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:37,923
- Look here, Officer... 
- Det. Munch.

26
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:40,669
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable 
with a female detective.

27
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:44,291
I'd be happy to talk 
to anyone with a brain.

28
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,115
There are five stages of grief.

29
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:50,423
Try not to go through them 
all at once.

30
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,091
Cute.

31
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,560
I'll talk slower.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,886
I don't need SOP explained to me...

33
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,441
I don't need a rape kit...

34
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:03,224
and I really don't need you 
to hold my hand!

35
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,322
Look, it doesn't matter 
if you've had prior

36
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:08,291
- consensual sex with this man. 
- Sure.

37
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,738
Doesn't even matter 
if you're still in a relationship with him.

38
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:15,822
He's my husband.

39
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,726
You and I need 
to see a doctor.

40
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,808
As soon as you give me an address...

41
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,254
we can pick up your husband.

42
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:38,086
He's at Manhattan South.
Sgt. Lloyd Andrews, Homicide.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/12/01

55
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:38,922
You care to join us, Detective?

56
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:41,414
I'd love to, 
but I've got reports to file

57
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,580
and coffee to make.

58
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:51,659
Regardless of your personal feelings,

59
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,287
I want you on my team.

60
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:55,717
But only for as long 
as you want to be here.

61
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:58,675
It's nice to be wanted.

62
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,779
Well, these aren't going 
to file themselves.

63
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:12,413
So? / Patricia Andrews claims 
her husband raped her this morning.

64
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:15,619
She's got a sprained wrist, but nothing 
much else to suggest physical abuse.

65
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:17,336
She doesn't need the beat-up 
to prove it.

66
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:18,186
It's gonna need 
more than her word,

67
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:20,201
because my partner...
conveniently forgot to mention

68
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,785
our guy's Homicide, 
Manhattan South.

69
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:25,826
I didn't mention it, 'cause it's not 
important, at least not to me.

70
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:28,877
Twenty-year vet, citations a sheet long, 
high closure rate.

71
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,904
Along with making the brass very happy, 
the guy's also a rapist.

72
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,957
- Alleged rapist, thank you.
- Ever hear of "no"?

73
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:36,582
You ever hear of contractual abandonment?

74
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:39,545
The only reason to forsake all others 
is so you don't have to hear "no."

75
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,116
I've been married 16 years. 
I hear it all the time.

76
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:46,229
Okay, Munch, let me clue you in, 
a wife as property went out in 1984...

77
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:49,810
when the law finally realized that even 
a married woman is allowed to say no.

78
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,577
We get Mrs. Andrew's statement? 
She sign it?

79
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,605
Not yet. It's being typed.

80
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:57,193
Let's talk to her. Make sure 
she knows what the score is.

81
00:04:57,193 --> 00:05:00,182
Are you doubting what happened 
or her commitment?

82
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,901
I don't have his side of the story, 
and this suspect is a cop.

83
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,599
So Internal Affairs is going 
to be all over this.

84
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,913
I just don't think his badge should 
cushion the blow.

85
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,976
Have you ever rubbed IAB 
the wrong way?

86
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:18,684
I've never had the pleasure.

87
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:21,021
Then do it my way.

88
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,138
You two, canvass the neighbors.

89
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,723
Get some background 
on the happy couple.

90
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:28,097
John, you and your partner have 
a chat with the missis.

91
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:31,365
I will apprise the powers that be.

92
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,072
You know, if it turns out 
that he did in fact rape her...

93
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:37,018
and we didn't follow standard op, 
we're going to get buried in it.

94
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,620
That's going to happen regardless.

95
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:47,170
There's no smoking 
in government buildings.

96
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,205
Please read your statement 
carefully, then sign.

97
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:01,725
Where's your husband right now?

98
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:05,798
Every day he plays pick-up ball with 
some cop friends before his shift.

99
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:10,640
Before you put pen to paper, 
I want to hear it again in your own words.

100
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,823
Why? / You're going to have to 
get used to telling your story.

101
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:20,305
- Are you married?
- No, ma'am.

102
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:22,407
I know you're not. 
Who'd have you?

103
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,657
Are you always this pleasant?

104
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,571
Meaning, I got what 
was coming to me?

105
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:29,720
That's not how I see it, Mrs. Andrews. 
Nobody deserves this.

106
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,710
We've been married five years.

107
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:36,676
I just don't understand.

108
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:39,675
I've seen him get crazy, 
but never like this.

109
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:43,631
We fight, we make love.

110
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:46,889
I almost don't believe it myself.

111
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,523
Maybe he thought you were making up. 
Is that possible?

112
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:52,665
A chokehold is not foreplay 
for me, Detective.

113
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:55,153
And a pot to the head turns him on?

114
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,310
You're not going to do 
a damn thing to him.

115
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,866
No, not a damn thing.

116
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:07,406
If your story holds up, I'm gonna have 
to arrest him, Mrs. Andrews...

117
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:10,135
put cuffs on him, process him, 
and lock him up in a cage.

118
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,300
I just want to make sure 
you understand that.

119
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,546
What do you take me for?

120
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:24,062
HOME OF CYRUS PARKER
211 EAST 24TH STREET
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25

121
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:26,771
I wasn't expecting company.

122
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:28,386
What's this about?

123
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:31,034
We wanted to ask you 
about your neighbors next door.

124
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,439
Well, have a seat, please.

125
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,034
Do you know the Andrews?

126
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,734
- Who?
- They live on the first floor.

127
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,560
Mrs. Andrews, she's about 5'5", 
110, blond hair.

128
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,946
Mr. Andrews is a cop.

129
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,448
You mean the Springers.

130
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:48,953
No, we mean the Andrews.

131
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:52,676
People around here barely 
want to make eye contact...

132
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:55,701
so you can forget about introductions.

133
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:59,301
They're the Springers to me. 
Better than the show.

134
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,723
I take it, that means that they fight a lot.

135
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:04,883
Every day. 
Sometimes the cops come.

136
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:08,663
He pulls them aside. 
Then they leave.

137
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:11,441
I always wondered 
if he paid them off.

138
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,683
Did they fight this morning?

139
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:15,435
He left the house, 
trying to get away from her.

140
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:18,607
She came through the door 
and threw a pot.

141
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:20,694
That woman's got a hell of an aim.

142
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:23,916
Did you see him 
strike her? / No.

143
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,699
But he turned around 
and snatched her inside.

144
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:32,455
Did you see or hear 
anything else? / No.

145
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:35,288
Did something bad happen?

146
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:39,223
Gentlemen.

147
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:44,341
Det. Santiago, my partner, 
Det. Howard, Internal Affairs.

148
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:46,311
Nice to meet you.

149
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:49,711
Just give me the word. Is it mine, 
or do I kick it to you?

150
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:52,018
We're not equipped to deal 
with sex crimes.

151
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:54,187
Have a nice day.

152
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:56,637
You know, I'd be sore, too.

153
00:08:57,945 --> 00:08:59,389
I'm not following.

154
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:02,113
We know IAB used you 
to bring down your mentor.

155
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:04,385
We just want you to know 
those were the old days.

156
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:05,692
That is truly comforting.

157
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:07,588
We're not here to grind your wheat.

158
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,288
Just do us a favor, 
take it slow and easy.

159
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:12,006
Finesse and kid gloves.

160
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:14,548
Since when does IAB 
care about finesse?

161
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,552
Come on, give us a break.
The guy's not on the take,

162
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:19,346
skimming drugs, 
or pimping on the side.

163
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:23,970
Isn't it enough that we kiss 
their collective PC ass?

164
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,447
What's next, castration?

165
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:28,136
We marry them just 
to have it available.

166
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:31,671
So tell me, how do you rape a wife?

167
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:37,369
Okay.
Thanks.

168
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,002
We got four domestic disputes 
at the Andrews' residence.

169
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,495
Dispo'd at the scene.

170
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:44,979
No arrests. Same uniforms, 
Clarkson and Powell.

171
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:47,622
- Are they on tour?
- Just signed out for a break.

172
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,922
- No arrests?
- Nope.

173
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:54,318
- Thanks. Have a nice day.
- Powell and Clarkson?

174
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,701
So the groom's mother goes 
to the bride's mother and asks:

175
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,573
"Why is the bride smiling?"

176
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:02,669
'Cause she never has 
to get on her knees again.

177
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,207
Old joke. Do you mind?

178
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,950
Det. Benson, I'm Det. Stabler, SVU.

179
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,723
We want to talk to you 
about the DIRs at the Andrews' place.

180
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:13,794
Right. Nothing to it. 
Handled at the scene each time.

181
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,223
The last one out, 
we told the sarge...

182
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:18,031
if it happened again, 
we'd have no choice. Why?

183
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,886
Well, four times is 
three times too many.

184
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,614
You see abuse, 
you take action, right?

185
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:25,915
He's a fellow officer. 
He asked a favor, we gave it.

186
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:27,905
So you look the other way 
no matter what?

187
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:31,360
Is that in your cop manual? 
Because it sure as hell ain't in mine.

188
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,930
- What gives?
- You didn't do your job.

189
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,944
And because you didn't, 
we caught it.

190
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:39,549
And since it rolls downhill, 
I figured you're next.

191
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,926
Sarge and his wife fight, 
loud and hard.

192
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:46,814
Names they call each other, I wouldn't 
say to a hump in the back of my cruiser.

193
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,083
It blows real hot, then it's over.

194
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,262
Besides, if we really 
wanted to do him a favor...

195
00:10:51,262 --> 00:10:54,484
we'd run his old lady in, 
no matter what he said.

196
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:57,322
Okay, wait a minute, you're telling 
us that his wife's the abuser?

197
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,230
Don't know if I'd say that.

198
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,166
But when she gets ticked off, 
she likes to throw whatever's handy.

199
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:07,867
Well, how real does it look?

200
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,278
It's hard to say.

201
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:10,606
Break up to make up.

202
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:13,368
Wife's a bit of a bruiser, 
Andrews seems to be handling it.

203
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:14,537
By raping her?

204
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:15,538
I'm not a fly on their bedroom wall.

205
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:18,462
That's too bad. 'Cause what's 
this cop going to say when we ask?

206
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:20,970
"I raped my wife. 
Please, put me in jail."

207
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,580
Why don't we let the ADA decide?

208
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,600
It looks like she might not have to.

209
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,718
For the first time in my career, 
IAB acts like they want to flush it.

210
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:32,459
So either there's some other agenda, 
or this could come back to bite us.

211
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,921
Bring Andrews in for an interview.

212
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:38,046
I don't think we can, without some SBA 
lawyer turning him into a deaf-mute.

213
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:40,060
Any other ideas?

214
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,015
If it's not official, 
it's not going to hold up.

215
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,021
I'm not looking for 
a confession, Elliot.

216
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:48,239
I just want to get a read on this guy 
before he gets wise.

217
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,754
- Pick him up. / - I got him.
- Take it up. It's all you.

218
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,042
Who's next?

219
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,898
Lloyd Andrews, Homicide. 
Ceasar Vasques out of Vice.

220
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:03,363
- Danny Tatum, he's one of mine.
- Elliot Stabler, SVU.

221
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:06,045
Sex crimes. 
I hear that's a tough gig.

222
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:08,572
I hear they rotate you guys out every 
two years. Is it really that rough?

223
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:10,713
Well, Homicide's no picnic, 
either, right?

224
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:13,048
A body's past caring whether 
you close a case or not.

225
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:17,180
Live victims are needy. 
Takes a real strong cop to suck it up.

226
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,220
- Two on two? 
- Yeah,

227
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,263
you're on my team. 
Take it to the hole.

228
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,064
- What the hell was that?
- What's the matter?

229
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:35,919
There's no fouls on the blacktop.

230
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,272
What's the matter? 
Can't you take it?

231
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:40,130
Hey, come on, guys. 
Let's play ball.

232
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,831
Your ball.

233
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,959
Knock it off. Come on. Move!

234
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,482
Calm down, man. Knock it off.

235
00:12:57,482 --> 00:13:00,752
Okay, what'd I miss?

236
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,814
Tatum's trying to give you a message, 
all right? But I don't operate that way.

237
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:07,475
He and I will have words later. 
You okay?

238
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,489
I guess I don't understand his language.

239
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,069
Don't you?

240
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,746
Why don't you spell it out for me?

241
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,282
I'll tell you what.

242
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:18,983
You can ask me all the questions 
you want after the game.

243
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:21,239
Questions?

244
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:24,457
Rape, right?

245
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:34,325
And maybe the guy was telling me 
what I wanted to hear...

246
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:36,724
but he seemed pretty genuine to me.

247
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:40,077
Was this before or after 
his goon kicked your ass?

248
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:42,689
Andrews did know that 
we were looking into him.

249
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,837
Okay, yeah, well.

250
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,484
So his partner got overly enthusiastic.

251
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:47,821
Andrews stepped in and saved 
the other eye, didn't he?

252
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:50,426
I'd like to believe that Fin would 
show me the same kind of loyalty.

253
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:52,926
A little history first, 
might help your case.

254
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:57,684
So all we have thus far, is a physically 
abusive woman crying rape. Is that the gist?

255
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:00,039
What motive could she have for saying 
that her husband raped her?

256
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,866
Pending divorce, for one.

257
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:03,961
You don't have to worry about 
fighting over which half you get...

258
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,142
when the mate you hate's 
locked in a cell.

259
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,413
We already checked that. 
No papers were filed.

260
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:12,919
All she has to do is wait. 
We get rid of him for her, then she files.

261
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,685
What?

262
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:18,722
Yeah, we're on the way.

263
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:23,566
A unit was dispatched to the Andrews' 
residence. Assault with a deadly weapon.

264
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,499
A Mr. Parker called it in.

265
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,918
You touch me again, 
I'll cut your pig heart out!

266
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,636
Why aren't you in jail?

267
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,190
Get away, you stupid bitch.

268
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,810
I should wait till you're asleep 
and set you on fire!

269
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,456
You better kill me, 
or I'll do you without leaving a mark!

270
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,469
- You freak!
- Hey!

271
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:42,606
Look out!
Let's go. Come on.

272
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:45,293
- Take it easy!
- Get off!

273
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:46,955
- Take it easy.
- I'm taking her in.

274
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,633
I don't think so. 
I've got it from here.

275
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,064
- Okay. I'm all right. 
- Get off of me!

276
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:53,588
Listen, this isn't helping you at all. 
Let's go, let's get up here.

277
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:57,180
All right. Just take a breath. 
Calm down.

278
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,425
- Why isn't he in jail?
- Calm down.

279
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:06,473
You again. What is it this time? 
Or do you answer DIRs now?

280
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:09,825
I'm going to need you to come on down 
and answer some questions.

281
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,352
I think I need a lawyer.

282
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:14,755
Yeah, I think so, too.

283
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,246
You call this finesse?

284
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:20,346
I've had calls from the brass...

285
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:24,001
wanting to know did I orchestrate 
an undercover operation with SVU...

286
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,048
and the press has already 
gotten a whiff of it.

287
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:28,044
What kind of Mickey Mouse Club is this?
(µðÁî´Ï »çÀÇ ¾î¸°ÀÌ TV ¼î)

288
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:30,631
See, actually I hate that little, 
black rodent.

289
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,636
Now, Dick Tracy, that was a club.
(À¯¸íÇÑ ¸¸È­ ĳ¸¯ÅÍ·Î Çü»çÀÓ)

290
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:35,275
You got this great decoder ring 
and a really cool watch.

291
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,788
Are you going to say something, 
Ms. Cabot?

292
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:39,530
- Like what?
- Protocol.

293
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,934
Like, if you're charging 
a sergeant with rape.

294
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,832
Like, if you would rein 
in your squad...

295
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:47,052
and if you could be so kind as 
to keep us informed as to status.

296
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:49,099
Very well.

297
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:52,941
Charging Andrews prior to his making 
a formal statement is premature.

298
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:56,290
Am I sweeping it under the rug, 
as you'd prefer? No.

299
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,682
And I strongly advise you to discontinue 
obstructing this unit from doing its job.

300
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,504
Or I will be more than happy 
to file charges...

301
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:04,000
naming you and your partner 
as coconspirators.

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,504
IAB is here, strictly 
in a supervisory capacity.

303
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:09,010
Not anymore.

304
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,369
You may consider yourselves 
officially updated.

305
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:29,140
Let the record show that I will not talk 
to you without my lawyer.

306
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,807
- Okay, interview's over.
- Yeah.

307
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,934
All right. But maybe 
we should clear this up,

308
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,386
so we can all get back to work.

309
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:37,171
Your wife already told 
us what happened.

310
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:38,406
So now we'd just like 
to hear it from you.

311
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,633
- What did she say?
- That you raped her.

312
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,421
Now, before you deny it, 
let's just sit down

313
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,519
and go through the sequence 
of events.

314
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:48,616
All right, fair enough.

315
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,584
I've been working steady midnights 
for a while.

316
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:54,377
I come home, I'm tired. 
Right away she starts in on me.

317
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:58,175
- She swears that I got a piece on the side.
- And do you?

318
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:03,548
Yeah, so? / So why do you think 
she'd accuse you of rape?

319
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:06,443
It doesn't take a genius. 
And she's pissed.

320
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,783
You know, it's always 
something with her.

321
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,518
Either I don't love her, 
or I smother her.

322
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:12,988
You guys figure it out, 
because she's driving me nuts.

323
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,036
Divorce is a hell of 
a better option than rape.

324
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:17,397
I did not rape my wife.

325
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:20,599
And he comes sauntering home 
like nothing happened.

326
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,906
So why'd you stay there?

327
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,191
Where should I go?

328
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:26,672
It's my house, my things. 
I did nothing wrong.

329
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:31,120
You cut him with a kitchen knife, 
and you threw a baton into the crowd.

330
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,928
I was scared 
when he walked in like that.

331
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,589
You know, I thought 
he was in jail.

332
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,481
You got anybody you could stay with? 
Family, friends?

333
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:41,508
You said you would arrest him. 
So what happened?

334
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:45,634
I walked away. Things were getting 
out of hand. Tempers were hot.

335
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:48,761
So what does that freaking cow do? 
She hurls a pot and nails me with it.

336
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:51,536
But you didn't keep walking. 
You grabbed her and went back inside.

337
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:52,731
I sure as hell did.

338
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:54,673
So that's when you raped her.

339
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,839
Nice try, but, no. 
I started packing her bags.

340
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,035
That lease is under my name.

341
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,514
I'll be damned if I let her run me 
out of my house...

342
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,364
screaming, threatening me 
with kitchen utensils.

343
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:05,737
What does that mean? 
Threatening you with kitchen utensils?

344
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:07,734
She came after me with a knife. 
I disarmed her.

345
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,854
- And how'd you do that?
- Standard academy move.

346
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,318
Come on, guys. Don't you get it? 
She's crazy.

347
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:16,339
Patricia hasn't been right since 
we found out she can't have kids.

348
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:24,003
And that's when our marriage 
started to go south.

349
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,591
So why didn't you file for divorce?

350
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:29,641
I love him.

351
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,267
I want counseling.

352
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:34,521
He won't go.

353
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:39,397
But he'll have to after the trial, 
won't he? They'll make him.

354
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:41,228
If he's convicted.

355
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:42,811
We're not even sure we can charge him.

356
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,692
Well, who gets to decide that?

357
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:46,020
Her name's Cabot.

358
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,573
So let me talk to her. She's a woman. 
She'll understand.

359
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:52,072
- He raped me.
- We made love.

360
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:55,373
Did you hold her down? Did you use 
a chokehold to control her?

361
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,371
I don't touch my wife like that, ever.

362
00:18:57,371 --> 00:19:00,919
I know I could do some serious damage. 
Besides, I'm the guy with the battle scars.

363
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,848
But you do know how to do her 
without leaving a mark.

364
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:06,354
Isn't that right, Sergeant?

365
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:13,731
It's your call.

366
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,293
Cut him loose.

367
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:18,046
We don't arrest him now, we send 
a message to every wife...

368
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:21,238
that if she's raped by her husband, 
she'd better get beat up, too.

369
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:22,593
What do you want me to do about it?

370
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:23,658
Book him.

371
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:25,259
Let a jury decide who they believe.

372
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,822
I don't even have enough 
to get past the grand jury.

373
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:31,073
- Alex.
- Walk him.

374
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:41,151
- You have business here?
- Yeah, Captain, I do.

375
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:43,377
- Is my sergeant pinched?
- That doesn't concern you.

376
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:45,098
I don't know who you work for...

377
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:47,507
but in my department we watch out 
for each other.

378
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,413
Maybe riding the desk, you forget.

379
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:53,967
Well, I enforce the law, and the only thing 
I ride is any hump who breaks it.

380
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,432
Feeling wood for my buddy?

381
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:57,758
I am now, cheap shot.

382
00:19:57,758 --> 00:20:00,730
Get out of my squad room before I lodge 
a complaint with your lieutenant.

383
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,446
Who do you think sent us over here?

384
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:03,517
Is he charged or not?

385
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,851
He's free to go.

386
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:11,990
Sarge?

387
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:24,038
I want my wife charged with assault.

388
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,840
- Lloyd.
- Right. Do it.

389
00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:30,979
How can he do this?

390
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,684
I don't know, but I'll ask him. 
Count on it. Come on.

391
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:38,914
Come on, let's go.

392
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:57,241
You mind?

393
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:08,058
I told Lloyd I would quit.

394
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,330
Now's a good a time as any.

395
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,333
It's a bad habit.

396
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,347
Although, some are worse than others.

397
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:15,168
My wife has some pretty foul ones.

398
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:17,087
Thought you weren't married.

399
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:20,436
My soon-to-be ex calls me 
often with requests for money...

400
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:23,936
and updates on the status 
of our uncoupling.

401
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:25,323
You hate her.

402
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,394
That would make it too easy.

403
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:30,261
We're not together anymore, 
but we still fight.

404
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:32,701
Only now, I'm not there 
for the tantrums.

405
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:35,617
So you bust my chops, 
because I remind you of her.

406
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:39,189
No, I just don't like you.

407
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,417
Well, at least you're honest.

408
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,415
So what're you doing here?

409
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:48,996
I came here to gloat.

410
00:21:49,713 --> 00:21:52,392
How're you holding up?

411
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:55,054
I'm all right.

412
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:57,344
A little worried about Lloyd.

413
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:02,722
Never underestimate the generosity 
of women.

414
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:07,645
My husband likes to work midnights, 
so he doesn't have to sleep.

415
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,981
One time, I came home 
and Lloyd was in the kitchen...

416
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:14,638
scrubbing his bullets in the sink...

417
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:17,083
his gun laid out on a towel.

418
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,040
Is there anything you need?

419
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:29,606
Yeah.
³×

420
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:33,809
Would you drop by my house 
and check on my husband?

421
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:37,282
Just make sure he's okay?

422
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,824
"File number 248957.

423
00:22:56,824 --> 00:23:01,122
"People v. Patricia Eileen Andrews, 
assault in the first."

424
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:03,780
We'll waive reading, Your Honor, 
and enter a plea of not guilty.

425
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,192
The People waive bail and request ROR.

426
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,691
You're feeling awfully generous, Counselor.

427
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:10,862
The extenuating circumstances 
call for compassion.

428
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:12,588
Well, those aside...

429
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:15,294
the defendant exhibited 
a serious lack of control...

430
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,604
towards police and emergency personnel,

431
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,956
by tossing a baton into the crowd.

432
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,466
It was an isolated incident.

433
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,683
We do not regard the defendant 
as a danger to herself or to others.

434
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:26,764
I assume defense counsel has no objection.

435
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:30,308
None, Your Honor. If the People wish to 
do my job for me, who am I to argue?

436
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,642
Well, however lightly our ADA...

437
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:37,207
may take the endangerment 
of city personnel, I do not.

438
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,697
$10,000 bond, post with the clerk.

439
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:45,627
ONE POLICE PLAZA
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27

440
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:49,167
Unfortunate mess, this Andrews business.

441
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:51,653
- How's it going?
- Well, it's like pulling teeth.

442
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:54,968
And I sure as hell could do without 
all the pressure that goes with it.

443
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:59,124
I'm afraid it's business as usual. 
You'll sort it out.

444
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:02,307
Actually, I called you down here 
on another matter.

445
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,000
It seems that one of your detectives 
is filing a discrimination suit...

446
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,310
against the department.

447
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,298
Jefferies.

448
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,599
Papers were delivered first thing 
this morning.

449
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,516
Legal is going over the complaint 
for merit.

450
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:18,985
And nobody's happy, 
and you want me to talk to her.

451
00:24:18,985 --> 00:24:20,896
Unofficially, yes.

452
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:24,830
No one at One Police Plaza can talk to 
her without complicating the issue.

453
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,062
Well, I don't see how I can do anything. 
She's angry...

454
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:30,454
and I didn't realize 
how angry till right now.

455
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:36,211
Prior to this dispute, did you have a good 
relationship with this detective?

456
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:39,078
Yes, I believe I did.

457
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:42,175
But now you're not so sure?

458
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:46,101
Don, I don't think it's personal.

459
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:50,301
She hasn't named in her suit, 
she just wants back in the field.

460
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:53,931
Well, then, we have a problem, sir.

461
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:57,230
Because I don't think 
we can fold on the issue.

462
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,722
Well, talk to her as a friend.

463
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:03,034
And if that doesn't work?

464
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,454
Make it go away, Captain.

465
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:13,014
Guess who just paid 
Patricia Andrews' bail? / Her husband.

466
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:18,525
Got a call from a buddy in Processing. 
I smell a recant, Counselor. / Fine.

467
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:21,389
Let's see how cute the sergeant plays 
it when I get him on the stand.

468
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,845
I thought you were dropping it. 
Not enough for a grand jury.

469
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:26,093
I was, until the sergeant had 
his wife arrested.

470
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:29,663
He pays her bail, looks suspicious. 
That I can sell.

471
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:32,707
I didn't know women got into 
whizzing contests.

472
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:37,772
Invite Mrs. Andrews down for a chat. 
I think it's time we cleared the air.

473
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:42,403
Did your husband or any of his friends 
on the force threaten you?

474
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:45,875
No. I just don't want to go through with 
it anymore is all.

475
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,186
What made you change your mind?

476
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:50,302
My husband could go to jail over 
a misunderstanding...

477
00:25:50,302 --> 00:25:53,620
a petty marital spat. 
I can't live with that.

478
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,956
Just seems strange you would change 
your tune so easily...

479
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:58,845
after singing the he-raped-me song 
to anybody who would listen.

480
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,039
I was mad.

481
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,322
Wouldn't have anything to do 
with your husband...

482
00:26:01,322 --> 00:26:03,910
dropping the felony assault charge, 
would it?

483
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,164
- No.
- Who paid your bail?

484
00:26:08,164 --> 00:26:11,090
He's a good guy. Really.

485
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,358
According to you, your husband's 
a first-class arrogant jackass...

486
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:17,396
who put you in a chokehold and took 
what no man has a right to.

487
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:20,431
And he apologized for that!

488
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:26,405
You know, all I ever wanted was 
for him to put himself in my place.

489
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:30,438
You know, he's never really said 
"I'm sorry" about anything.

490
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:32,243
This was genuine.

491
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:35,221
What did he say exactly?

492
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:38,280
He said:

493
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:42,376
"I'm sorry I raped you, Patty.

494
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:46,840
"It is unforgivable."

495
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,645
And to give him another chance.

496
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:55,138
- Those were his exact words?
- Yes.

497
00:26:55,945 --> 00:27:00,011
So you see why I have to 
drop this, okay?

498
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:02,435
I feel like we're starting over.

499
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:09,171
For the first time in our marriage, 
he's trying to feel my pain.

500
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:17,494
You can't make me change my mind.

501
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:19,822
I love him.

502
00:27:19,822 --> 00:27:21,393
He admits it...

503
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:24,612
and you respond by trying to recant. 
That's not love, that's psycho.

504
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:26,803
Think whatever you want.

505
00:27:26,803 --> 00:27:31,882
I'm not crazy enough to lose my husband 
just 'cause you want to believe me now.

506
00:27:33,346 --> 00:27:36,183
Can I go?

507
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:47,868
Well, I can charge her with filing 
a false police report...

508
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:50,993
but what I'd really like to do is charge 
her with felony assault.

509
00:27:50,993 --> 00:27:52,920
You just want to put somebody 
in jail, is that it?

510
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,869
No. I want to force her hand a little.

511
00:27:55,869 --> 00:27:58,813
I don't see Andrews refiling just 
to make your day.

512
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:03,337
He won't have to if we can find another 
witness to the attack.

513
00:28:03,337 --> 00:28:07,462
I heard them fighting 
so I called the police.

514
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:09,218
I didn't see anything.

515
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:11,123
We were told it was assault 
with a deadly weapon.

516
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:15,504
The only way the dispatcher could have 
known that is if you told her so.

517
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:18,146
Sgt. Andrews won't find out 
it was me?

518
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:22,470
Not a word you say. 
Now, did you see the attack?

519
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:29,696
She had a knife. 
She cut him.

520
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:32,311
Assault two, Ms. Cabot? 
You're reaching

521
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:35,198
Not at all.
Your client cut her husband.

522
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:37,746
I've got the knife, her prints, 
and a witness.

523
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:39,443
That's three years in Bedford Hills.

524
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:42,426
And trust me, it is not the country-club 
setting it sounds like.

525
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:43,898
What happened to compassion?

526
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:46,001
Motive for the assault was 
fear of reprisal.

527
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:49,959
She recanted, so it's moot, 
along with my compassion.

528
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,102
Tell you what, I'll bump 
it down to assault three.

529
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:55,941
That'll shave 18 months.

530
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:58,196
What do you want?

531
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:01,131
I want an indictment for rape 
in the first degree...

532
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:02,325
and the only way I'm going to get it,

533
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:05,556
is with your client 
in front of a grand jury.

534
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:09,815
This is blackmail.

535
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:13,353
No, Mrs. Andrews, it's the law.

536
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:19,227
MANHATTAN SOUTH
HOMICIDE TASK FORCE
4TH PRECINCT
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28

537
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:26,751
We're busy.

538
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:29,537
In my pocket is a warrant 
for your arrest.

539
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:33,481
Don't make me Mirandize 
and cuff you in here.

540
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:46,021
- Hold this for me.
- What the hell is going on here?

541
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:49,065
- I thought this was settled.
- Evidently not.

542
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:51,762
You want to get out of my way?

543
00:29:57,688 --> 00:29:59,777
Thanks, buddy.

544
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:14,529
"File number 25527. 
People v. Lloyd David Andrews.

545
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:16,228
"One count of rape in the first degree...

546
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,535
"one count of sexual misconduct 
in the first degree...

547
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:21,235
"and one count of sexual abuse."

548
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:22,657
How do you plead?

549
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:24,069
Not guilty, Your Honor.

550
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:27,233
The People ask 
that bail be set at $50,000.

551
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:29,934
- What?
- Quiet!

552
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:34,246
This is a venal attempt to further smear 
my client who has ties to the community.

553
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,500
He's a respected member 
of New York's finest...

554
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,494
and would like nothing but his day in court 
to answer these specious accusations.

555
00:30:40,494 --> 00:30:42,827
We ask that he be remanded under 
his own recognizance.

556
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:44,364
Your Honor, this is a heinous crime.

557
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:46,090
The People are not prepared 
to send the message...

558
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,844
that officers of the law 
get a free ride.

559
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:54,297
You are not a messenger, Ms. Cabot. 
So save your button-pushing for the trial.

560
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:58,468
Enter a plea of not guilty, and since the 
defendant is not a flight-risk, he's ROR.

561
00:30:58,468 --> 00:31:00,172
Your Honor, the People ask 
for an order of protection...

562
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,468
and that the defendant surrender 
all weapons.

563
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:04,611
So ordered.

564
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,532
Let's talk.

565
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,202
Sex abuse one, three years.

566
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:17,403
Let's not fight.

567
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:19,427
Submit your congratulations 
and be done with it.

568
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:22,431
Don't be hasty, Sam. I'm offering to 
drop this to a D felony.

569
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:25,535
You obviously don't gamble. 
You don't fold a winning hand.

570
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,571
My guy's walking away 
from this unscathed.

571
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:29,424
I'm just trying to save us 
both some time.

572
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:31,037
All you've got is a bitter wife.

573
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:33,172
You put her on the stand, 
the recant goes in the record...

574
00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:36,207
along with her witnessed 
physical attacks on my client.

575
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:37,799
Why are you fighting this?

576
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,347
Because he did it.

577
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:42,203
And he doesn't deserve his freedom, 
and he doesn't deserve to wear a badge.

578
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:43,726
When did he confess exactly?

579
00:31:43,726 --> 00:31:46,073
A few days ago, to his wife.

580
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,723
Privileged. Where's your case?

581
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,102
In the courtroom, in front of a jury.

582
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:52,145
Didn't I tell you, 
we're going bench, not jury.

583
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:53,777
Come on, Alex, don't be a sore loser.

584
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:57,992
Drop the charges and send the kiddies 
to counseling where they belong.

585
00:31:57,992 --> 00:32:00,071
No.

586
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:07,007
For the egg on your face.

587
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,314
ARRAIGNMENT COURT
TRIAL PART 26
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29

588
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,962
Do you recognize this internal report, 
Det. Munch?

589
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:18,464
Yes, it's the report of an interview 
I conducted with the victim...

590
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:20,710
Patricia Andrews. 
You were present at the time.

591
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,675
What was the purpose of the interview?

592
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:26,307
Mrs. Andrews urgently wanted to drop 
the rape charges against her husband.

593
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:28,843
Did Mrs. Andrews actually 
say her husband didn't rape her?

594
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:30,603
No, she did not.

595
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:33,310
So it's your testimony that the victim 
came into the precinct...

596
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,426
to drop the charges and clear her husband 
but never refuted what happened, correct?

597
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:40,503
She said that her husband sincerely 
apologized for raping her...

598
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:42,994
and that was the first time 
in their marriage that he had done so.

599
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:46,006
Objection. She said, 
he said, it's double hearsay.

600
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,417
Exception to hearsay.

601
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:50,210
Your Honor, the defendant admitted 
to the felony.

602
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,091
It's a statement against a penal interest.

603
00:32:52,091 --> 00:32:54,637
Why would Lloyd Andrews, 
a 20-year vet on the Homicide Division...

604
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:56,081
admit to guilt if he didn't do it?

605
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:58,620
At the very least, 
the alleged apology is privileged.

606
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,162
By telling it to a third party, 
it becomes hearsay,

607
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:03,389
therefore, no privilege exists.

608
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:06,392
The exception is granted. 
Overruled.

609
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:08,403
Nothing further.

610
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:13,976
You threw a pot from the stove. 
Was it still hot?

611
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:15,911
No.

612
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,829
I didn't want to hurt him.

613
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,370
What happened then?

614
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:25,594
Then he grabbed me 
by the back of my head,

615
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:28,223
and dragged me into the house.

616
00:33:28,937 --> 00:33:30,716
Go on.

617
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:32,963
Then we fought some more.

618
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:35,390
Was it physical?

619
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:43,695
I kept hitting him, 
and he'd push me back.

620
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:44,852
And I'd hit him some more and...

621
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:47,721
Did he rape you?

622
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:53,218
I don't know.

623
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:55,446
Didn't you say he slammed 
you against a wall...

624
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:58,727
threw his arm across your neck, 
and squeezed?

625
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:00,769
Didn't you state that 
you almost lost consciousness?

626
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:02,930
Didn't you tell police 
that he pulled your pants down...

627
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,861
removed your panties, 
and raped you?

628
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:06,629
Is that the truth, Mrs. Andrews?

629
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,860
I suppose.

630
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,124
Yes or no?

631
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:14,666
Yes.

632
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,683
Nothing further.

633
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:22,366
Mrs. Andrews, did you go 
to the police and recant?

634
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:24,124
I did.
³×

635
00:34:24,124 --> 00:34:27,661
And were you facing assault one charges, 
and did Ms. Cabot offer you a deal...

636
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:30,315
- in exchange for your testimony?
- Yes.

637
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,633
- Then why are we here?
- Objection.

638
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:34,001
Withdrawn.

639
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:36,230
Mrs. Andrews, didn't you decide 
to drop the rape charge...

640
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,838
after your husband dropped the assault 
charges against you?

641
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:41,062
That's not how it was, you bitch!

642
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:43,298
You're twisting everything around!

643
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:44,694
Watch the language.

644
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:46,784
In fact, didn't you suddenly 
have a change of heart...

645
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:50,220
after having a long conversation 
with your husband?

646
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:59,292
Answer the question, or I can arrange 
accommodations for you to think about it.

647
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,794
Yes.
³×

648
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:11,091
We've been married for five years. 
And for the most part...

649
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:14,789
we've been pretty happy, 
but lately it's been hell.

650
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:18,480
How many times have the police been 
called to your residence?

651
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,370
Four.

652
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,892
My wife loses control.

653
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:26,250
She's the batterer, Mr. Andrews.

654
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,278
Why have you been protecting her?

655
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:31,064
I love her.

656
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:34,994
I couldn't see her get locked up 
over something that's my fault.

657
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:37,418
She's the one who throws 
heavy objects.

658
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,968
She grabs the knife and attacks.

659
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:42,332
Why is it your fault?

660
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:45,212
I haven't always been 
the best husband.

661
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:49,005
I've cheated on her, 
I don't always come home.

662
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:52,941
I wouldn't, either. 
Withdrawn.

663
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,461
Did you force your wife 
to have sex with you? / No.

664
00:35:57,461 --> 00:36:00,838
Did you put her in a chokehold or in any 
way touch her with excessive force?

665
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:02,358
No, I did not.

666
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:04,978
Since the physical evidence bears 
witness to that...

667
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:09,146
why would your wife accuse you 
of such a despicable crime?

668
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:18,678
I had promised to cut off 
a yearlong relationship.

669
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:21,656
I didn't, and she found out about it.

670
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:25,461
But I've since stopped 
seeing the woman.

671
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:28,742
I love my wife.

672
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:34,378
Then why would you apologize for rape, 
if you didn't do it?

673
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:39,862
My wife can't let anything go. 
She's got to be right, always.

674
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:43,286
I'd rather lie and tell her that...

675
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:44,690
I'm sorry for something
that I didn't do...

676
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,372
than fight about it 
for the rest of my life.

677
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:52,845
I just want some peace, and I don't know 
a husband in the world who doesn't.

678
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:54,985
Nothing further.

679
00:36:57,504 --> 00:36:58,779
Mr. Andrews...

680
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:00,777
did you or did you not 
tell your wife...

681
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:04,449
you could do her 
without leaving a mark?

682
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:06,337
That's not what I meant when I said...

683
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:09,256
Let me remind you I can call 
any number of city personnel...

684
00:37:09,256 --> 00:37:11,580
who witnessed this statement.

685
00:37:13,669 --> 00:37:16,540
Did you or did you not threaten 
your wife with bodily harm?

686
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,916
The heifer told me that 
she was going to torch me!

687
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,574
What the hell was 
I supposed to say?

688
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,841
That heifer is supposed 
to be the woman you love?

689
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:45,011
Sexual misconduct, 
and he's out of a job.

690
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:46,968
Don't be ridiculous.

691
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,642
You haven't won.

692
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:52,463
I'd say I've evened the odds considerably, 
or you wouldn't be here.

693
00:37:52,463 --> 00:37:53,889
Deal, Alex.

694
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:56,522
At least concede that these two people 
should never be married...

695
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:58,003
especially not to each other.

696
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:01,552
- That's not my concern.
- Well, it should be.

697
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:07,627
Hell of a railroad job on 
what he said in the heat of the moment.

698
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:09,224
Got me thinking about the fights 
with my wife.

699
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:12,115
What people might say.

700
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:14,224
Sometimes I want to kill her.

701
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:17,489
If she dies, 
then you've got a problem.

702
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:22,133
D felony, still on the table. 
Three years, he'll be out in one.

703
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,960
With a sex-offender tag dragging 
him down the rest of his life.

704
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:45,148
You wanted to see me, Captain? 
So here I am.

705
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:47,103
Have a seat.

706
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:48,893
If you don't mind, 
I'd rather stand.

707
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,558
I have a feeling I'm not going 
to like what I hear.

708
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:56,990
It's not official. 
Just you and me.

709
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:05,609
Now, I know these last couple of months 
have been difficult for you.

710
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,486
I know you think we're the enemy.

711
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:09,856
So this is about my lawsuit?

712
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:11,729
Have you thought this through?

713
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:14,980
The politics and the stink, how hard 
they're going to try to make this for you...

714
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,471
has that crossed your mind?

715
00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:19,041
The only thing on my mind is 
the presumptuous attitude...

716
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,092
about my private life.

717
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:24,843
What I do on my own time, 
is not fodder for this department.

718
00:39:24,843 --> 00:39:27,489
This unit isn't like any other 
in the department.

719
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:30,419
Not all the same rules apply, Jefferies. 
You know that.

720
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:34,977
No. All I know is that 
when it hit the fan, you ducked.

721
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:40,095
You're my responsibility, 
and you're an integral part of my squad.

722
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:45,501
I did not agree with their conclusion, 
but I did agree that you need help.

723
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:50,405
What does my personal life have to do 
with my work or the way I do it?

724
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:54,177
The way I see it, it's the equivalent 
of you trying to eat your gun...

725
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:56,772
and I can't let that happen.

726
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:09,978
Then I don't think we have 
anything left to talk about.

727
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:23,091
Will the defendant please rise?

728
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:30,789
There is no doubt that spousal rape exists.

729
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:34,092
There is no doubt that a wife holds 
the same protection under the law...

730
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:38,091
from her husband and any other male 
acquaintance or stranger...

731
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:40,713
with regard to her own body.

732
00:40:40,713 --> 00:40:42,928
But how does the law determine...

733
00:40:42,928 --> 00:40:46,133
if a rape actually occurred 
within a relationship...

734
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:49,153
defined by its very nature...

735
00:40:49,153 --> 00:40:52,343
as normal sexual intimacy?

736
00:40:52,343 --> 00:40:56,020
Unfortunately, it cannot.

737
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,156
Nor should it, save corroboration 
or grievous injury.

738
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:04,562
Therefore, in the matter 
of the People v. Lloyd David Andrews...

739
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,124
the Defendant is hereby found...

740
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:10,720
not guilty of one count of rape 
in the first degree...

741
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,880
not guilty, one count of 
sexual misconduct in the first degree...

742
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,266
not guilty, one count of sexual abuse.

743
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:21,093
The defendant is free to go.

744
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,709
Well, that was a colossal 
waste of time.

745
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,273
I couldn't disagree more.

746
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:38,853
Forget about the wasted man-hours 
or even the taxpayers' money.

747
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:40,944
You lost. 
Where's the victory in that?

748
00:41:40,944 --> 00:41:44,740
I'm the only ADA to get spousal 
rape past the grand jury.

749
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,665
I may not have won, but I changed 
the climate, so somebody else can.

750
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:53,571
On the other hand, the only thing 
you may have proven here today...

751
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:55,839
is that women are still chattel.

752
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,371
Only if they want to be.

753
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,510
That's a little premature, 
don't you think?

754
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,758
I thought a narc hotshot like you would 
be worth at least 60 days.

755
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,540
They're not mine, Captain.

756
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,871
I guess Jefferies didn't want
