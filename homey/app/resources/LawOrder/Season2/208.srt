00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:25,311
In the criminal justice system,

3
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:28,930
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,446
In New York City,

5
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:33,594
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

6
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:36,662
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,832
These are their stories.

8
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,151
You know, 
they said it couldn't be done.

9
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:12,939
They said that Allen Thorpe 
couldn't possibly outdo himself again.

10
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,805
I bring you Manhattan's first 
family-friendly five-star hotel.

11
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,653
And I welcome each 
and every one of you...

12
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:25,681
to the official grand opening 
of the Thorpe Palace.

13
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:34,327
You know, of all my hotels, 
this one means the most.

14
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:38,331
Because it's the most personal. 
It's family.

15
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,701
So, we've got a lot more 
in store for you...

16
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,304
so enjoy the ride.

17
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,953
Help.

18
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,349
I was raped.

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,885
Excuse me.

31
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,763
You mind filling us in?

32
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,165
You mind smiling?

33
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,326
No reason to upset the guests.

34
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,273
- How could this happen?
- Mr. Miller...

35
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,443
Is this what you meant in your brochure  
by "safe as your mother's arms"?

36
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:34,647
Sir, we're Detectives Benson and Stabler. 
What happened here?

37
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:40,277
My sister, Siobhan. 
She was attacked.

38
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,256
When did this happen?

39
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,092
We contacted you immediately.

40
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,461
No, you took time 
to pull strings.

41
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,130
You got no blue-and-whites out front, 
no uniforms in here.

42
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,333
That's the idea, right? 
It's called obstructing.

43
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,736
I know what obstructing is, pal. 
I was on the job 20 years.

44
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,373
I assure you, no one associated with the 
Thorpe Hotel Corporation...

45
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,041
has knowingly 
obstructed justice here.

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,476
An attorney?

47
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:08,037
You got an attorney here 
before medical assistance or the police?

48
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,449
Come here.

49
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,151
How old are you, Siobhan?

50
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,584
Seventeen.

51
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,556
Can you tell me 
what happened?

52
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,894
I told it 
three times already.

53
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:26,455
Okay, let's get you 
to a hospital, all right?

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,927
I'll take that for you.

55
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:47,183
I went into my room, and...

56
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,424
my clothes and my makeup 
were all over the floor.

57
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,959
I couldn't understand it, 
you know?

58
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,063
And so I just 
stood there, staring.

59
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,937
And then I saw him.

60
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:11,669
Who?  
Did you know this person?

61
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,440
No.

62
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,683
I tried to run out, and...

63
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,621
he slammed my face 
against the door.

64
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,217
Then...

65
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,870
I tried to get away, 
and he went crazy.

66
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,842
He grabbed the phone 
and he started hitting me with it.

67
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,139
And then...

68
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:53,246
Okay, you can finish 
telling me at the hospital, all right?

69
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,244
He raped me.

70
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,495
No editing.

71
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,564
Excuse me. 
This is a restricted area.

72
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,432
Can't think of a place 
I'd rather be.

73
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,468
Detectives Munch 
and Tutuola.

74
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,937
Sorry. I thought you snuck 
out of the press pen.

75
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,071
What can I do for you?

76
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,741
We need tape rolled on everything  
you've got around room 328...

77
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,109
from the time of the incident.

78
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,778
Elevators, stairwells.

79
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:19,946
You know we just opened.

80
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,682
Yeah, the grand opening banner 
out front was our first clue.

81
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,550
Roll the tape.

82
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,954
We've got full coverage on everything  
from the fifth floor to the penthouse.

83
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,756
What about the rooms 
without a view?

84
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,693
They didn't quite make the deadline.  
They'll be operational by next week.

85
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,996
That's good news for future victims,  
but little comfort to Siobhan Miller.

86
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,066
Don't tell me we've had 
another freaking emergency.

87
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,001
What is this 
urgent matter, Winston?

88
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,403
That was us.

89
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,805
Pleasure to meet you, 
Mr. Thorpe.

90
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,206
And what do you want?

91
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,510
You weren't informed that one of  
your guests was brutally raped?

92
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,448
My head of security will be handling  
that matter. He's at your disposal.

93
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,040
I have guests waiting.

94
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,354
I understand that one of  
your employees discovered the victim?

95
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,856
Yeah, desk clerk, 
Terry Wilde.

96
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,591
We'll need 
to see him now.

97
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,427
Right this way.

98
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,996
Where did you stash our outcry witness, 
in the boiler room?

99
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,932
He's on his scheduled break 
in the employee cafeteria.

100
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,367
Guy's gotta eat.

101
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,102
And the show must go on.

102
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,037
Bet the party 
didn't miss a beat.

103
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,973
So tell us, Winston, exactly how long  
did you detain the victim...

104
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,042
before allowing her 
to receive medical attention?

105
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,612
We wanted to get that girl 
to the hospital right off. She refused.

106
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,182
Traumatized victims 
frequently refuse treatment.

107
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,317
Most people know better 
than to listen to them.

108
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,419
Bust my hump all you want, 
but I'm telling you...

109
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,922
we're gonna bend over backwards 
to assist you on this.

110
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,618
Okay, where was Allen Thorpe 
during the attack?

111
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:44,894
Terry, short for Terrence, 
Wilde as in Oscar.

112
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,467
Address?

113
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,602
Why? 
I didn't witness anything.

114
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,438
First person a rape victim speaks to 
about their attack...

115
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,308
is known as the outcry witness. 
That's you.

116
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,212
We didn't really speak. 
"I was raped." End of conversation.

117
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,982
Which makes you the only one that could  
testify to that statement in court.

118
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,517
Court? I have to go court?

119
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:08,154
It's pretty hectic here today. 
Why weren't you at your post?

120
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,124
Thought I might see 
Julia Roberts or somebody.

121
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,459
Look what happens.

122
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,256
Just isn't your day, is it?

123
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:20,032
CABRINI MEDICAL CENTER 
227 E, 19TH STREET 
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6

124
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,054
Severe trauma to the face,  
hairline fractures

125
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:26,772
on right wrist and one rib... 
bruise marks on breasts and arms.

126
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,140
Consistent with restraint?

127
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,509
Yes, definitely 
finger marks.

128
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,178
And deeper contusions 
on the legs.

129
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,145
Knee marks.

130
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,780
Yes. Evidence 
of penetration.

131
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,848
Rape kit done?

132
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,083
Just waiting 
to be vouchered.

133
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,483
Lot of fluids. 
Good chance we got semen.

134
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,814
Okay, thanks.

135
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,865
She's asleep, thank God.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,204
She was in so much pain, 
I begged them to up her morphine.

137
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,339
I'll sit with her for a while 
if you need a break.

138
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,643
Yeah, come on, 
let me buy you a cup of coffee.

139
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,778
I could use a cigarette.

140
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,350
He already took pictures.

141
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,790
Special interest case.

142
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,721
Powerful people involved. 
Evidence tends to get lost.

143
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,157
- Any sign of forced entry?
- No.

144
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:22,388
Victim's five feet. 
This is where the escape was thwarted.

145
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:28,255
He drags her across the floor, 
rips the phone from its cord.

146
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,924
You mind?

147
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,678
Hits her with the phone.

148
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,812
Throws her on the bed.

149
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,336
And rapes her.

150
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,511
Came prepared.

151
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,322
Pretty much rape, A to Z. 
You got anything else?

152
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,257
Yeah, we should all go 
buy lottery tickets.

153
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,360
Hotels, we usually get prints and fluids 
from a thousand guests.

154
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,062
But this baby 
is brand-spanking new.

155
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,826
Great. So you'll have 
print workups by the morning.

156
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,436
My baby sister. 
I'm supposed to protect her.

157
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,205
I was off at that party 
doing the hokey-pokey, for God's sake.

158
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,975
On your way down, you notice 
anyone hanging out in the hallway?

159
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,443
No.

160
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,446
What about earlier? 
Anyone stand out?

161
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,348
Everyone. 
We're from North Carolina.

162
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,183
Right.

163
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,785
Think. Maybe it didn't mean 
anything at the time...

164
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:24,523
but looking back, anyone 
pay particular attention to Siobhan?

165
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,126
There was a guy in the park, 
at the puppet show.

166
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,961
He was definitely 
staring at her.

167
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,563
Puppet show?

168
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,332
We're here on family vacation, 
with my wife and little girl.

169
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,301
What do you remember 
about this guy?

170
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,030
He was alone, no kids.

171
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,162
Can you describe him?

172
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,310
White, thirties maybe, 
brown hair.

173
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,112
Height? Weight?

174
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,444
Average. 
That's all I remember.

175
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,451
Where'd you go 
after the park?

176
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,043
Back to Hotel Hell.

177
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,059
Hi, I'm Detective Munch. 
This is Detective Tutuola.

178
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,594
I'm Siobhan's 
sister-in-law.

179
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,397
Perhaps we should talk 
in your room, Miss Miller. Is it nearby?

180
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,432
It's right in here.

181
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,229
No, I didn't hear anything.

182
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,139
Oh, my gosh, 
I must have been drying my hair.

183
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,573
Where was your daughter?

184
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,275
She was with my husband 
at the party.

185
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,512
Siobhan and I went swimming 
after the park and we were running late.

186
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,125
Was anyone at the pool 
bothering her?

187
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,550
No, we didn't even 
talk to anyone.

188
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,820
- Did anyone look out of place?
- No.

189
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,357
Do you mind if we finish this 
a little later?

190
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:36,123
After what's happened, I just feel like 
I need to spend some time with Tara.

191
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,531
What you got there, Spanky?

192
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,132
Hotel security tapes...

193
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:44,003
and a state-of-the-art, 
fully digitized deck on which to view them.

194
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,004
Happy?

195
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,700
Assuming there are 
no 18-minute gaps, ecstatic.

196
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,943
Sketch artist finished 
with Siobhan.

197
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,111
Latent finished up too.

198
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:56,415
The only print they couldn't eliminate 
turned up in the system.

199
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,519
Russell Ramsay. Released 18 months ago. 
One count statutory rape.

200
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,680
Siobhan is just this side of legal.

201
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,684
Pretty damn close.

202
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,862
Our man Winston actually 
came through.

203
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:10,963
How great is this?

204
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,832
Almost as great as 
us finding our guy.

205
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,995
Fin is throwing together 
a photo array to run by Siobhan.

206
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,271
That's Happy Feet!

207
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,670
Excuse me?

208
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,711
The odd bird at the party, 
and I don't mean the big yellow one.

209
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,076
Can you zoom in?

210
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,521
Okay, wait a minute.

211
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,691
Thorpe is just starting his speech. 
Siobhan came down just as he finished.

212
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,527
Odd behavior for a guy who just 
committed a rape, wouldn't you say?

213
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,429
I guess he worked up an appetite.

214
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,331
Why isn't he getting 
the hell out of Dodge?

215
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,798
Benson. Cragen's looking for you.

216
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,644
We just found our guy 
on the Miller case. Can this wait?

217
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,941
Close the door.

218
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,102
What?

219
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,408
Sit down, Olivia.

220
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,775
What?

221
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,590
Really, I think 
you should sit down.

222
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,455
Just tell me. 
What's going on?

223
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,726
Your mother had an accident.

224
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:25,060
I am so sorry. 
She didn't make it.

225
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,175
How?

226
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,776
She fell...

227
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,078
down the subway steps, 
110th and Broadway.

228
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,067
No.

229
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,207
My mother never 
takes the subway.

230
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,283
The entrance outside the Velvet Room.

231
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,887
She was drunk.

232
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,076
- did you talk to Benson?
- yeah.

233
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,880
You know, my brother's a mortician. 
In case she has any questions.

234
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,784
- You have a brother?
- I think we found Twinkle-Toes.

235
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,253
Can you believe 
this douche bag?

236
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,788
Killing a fellow cockroach.

237
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,723
Whatever happened 
to professional courtesy?

238
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,020
Russell Ramsay?

239
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,100
What's the problem?

240
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,870
That nobody's 
exterminated you yet.

241
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,605
You have the right 
to remain silent.

242
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,839
What'd I do?

243
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,109
Anything you say can and will be used 
against you in a court of law.

244
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,310
What'd I do?

245
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,479
Aside from defying 
the laws of rhythm?

246
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,014
You have the right 
to an attorney.

247
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,583
If you can't afford one, 
one will be given to you...

248
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,486
This is crazy. 
I never raped nobody.

249
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,456
So the rape that you were 
tried and convicted of three years ago...

250
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,858
what was that? 
A heinous miscarriage of justice?

251
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:56,095
That was statutory. 
And we were in love.

252
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,964
Yeah and I'm sure 
they'll make a TV movie of it one day.

253
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,500
- But, about Wednesday?
- Wednesday...

254
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,535
We've got your prints 
on the scene...

255
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,638
your bizarrely circuitous 
escape route on tape...

256
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,141
and your victim on her way 
down here to ID you as we speak.

257
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,810
I swear! 
I never raped nobody.

258
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,007
Russell. Now, Wednesday, noon?

259
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,482
I was with a girl.

260
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,248
At that new hotel, the...

261
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:28,116
Thorpe Palace. 
Her name's Siobhan.

262
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,702
You left her bloody and broken, and 
you're using her as an alibi?

263
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,500
What? What are you talking about?

264
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,807
That bitch said I raped her?

265
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,384
It was a date.

266
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,154
I met her at a bar. 
She gave me her room key.

267
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,190
You happen to remember 
the name of the bar?

268
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,960
Please take the stand.

269
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,529
You think you can 
make a case?

270
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,565
If I can get this girl in front of a jury 
before her wounds heal...

271
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,268
my opening statement would be 
"Prosecution rests."

272
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,937
I just wish we could get in his prior.

273
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,339
Too prejudicial.

274
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,910
No violence with the statutory. They 
were known to each other. No pattern.

275
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,814
Siobhan is just this side of legal. 
He preys on teenage girls.

276
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,442
Don't worry, 
I'll still bury this guy.

277
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm gonna bring them in now.

278
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,218
If you recognize the man 
who raped you...

279
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,281
identify him by number. 
Okay?

280
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,295
Sorry I'm late.

281
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,730
Thought you were 
taking time off.

282
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,958
I took it.

283
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,835
I don't know 
if I can do this.

284
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,069
You're gonna do fine.

285
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,434
Are we ready yet?

286
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,909
Bring them in.

287
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,377
Okay, right this way, 
gentlemen.

288
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,241
You just take your time.

289
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,551
Siobhan, do you recognize anyone?

290
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,202
It's okay, 
just say the number.

291
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,899
Excuse me. Move away 
from the witness, please.

292
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,583
Number four.

293
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,519
Which number?

294
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,187
Number four.

295
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,417
Now, where do you 
recognize him from?

296
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,289
That's the man who raped me.

297
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,905
Excuse me, there a detective 
I can talk to?

298
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,169
- About?
- Russell Ramsay.

299
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,444
Have a seat Ms...

300
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,173
Leevak. Shelly Leevak.

301
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,751
I guess you heard about Ramsay 
getting arrested again, huh?

302
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,953
He's not a rapist.

303
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,555
- Miss Leevak... 
- Shelly.

304
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,192
That would hold a lot more weight 
if he wasn't convicted of raping you.

305
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,095
It wasn't rape. 
He was my boyfriend.

306
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,364
My parents only filed the charges 
because they wanted us to be apart.

307
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,632
He was only 22.

308
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,835
And you were 15. 
He's a predator.

309
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:27,372
He's a nice guy. I know 
he didn't do anything to that skank.

310
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,741
You still have feelings 
for this man?

311
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,038
I love him.

312
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,708
Did Ramsay ask you 
to come down here?

313
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,950
I would've anyway.

314
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,819
He looked me in the eye 
and he said he didn't do it.

315
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:45,346
He looked me in the eye and said that 
he had sexual intercourse with the victim.

316
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,283
He cheated on me?

317
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:54,166
Only because I cheated on him first. 
We broke up a few days before.

318
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,335
A classic trigger for a rapist.

319
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,770
Traumatic event in 
an interpersonal relationship.

320
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,174
To regain control, 
he overpowers another woman.

321
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,869
He said he didn't do it.

322
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,346
There should be 
a special level of hell...

323
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:11,416
for this pus-sucking, gangrenous 
malignancy of a mental amoeba.

324
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,096
Somebody steal 
your parking space again?

325
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:18,323
Ramsay just sent in his first victim 
to defend him against his second.

326
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,058
From the statutory rape case?

327
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,761
Shelly Leevak? The sweet little thing 
he deflowered at 15?

328
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,997
She's five years older 
but none the wiser.

329
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,633
Don't tell me she's trying to alibi him?

330
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,234
Everything but.

331
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,271
Explain to me how schmoes 
like us spend every night at home alone...

332
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,007
watching the History Channel, 
while a scum like Ramsay...

333
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,898
has this nice girl's complete devotion.

334
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,978
She is so convinced.

335
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:45,847
If there is any karma, Ramsay won't be 
doing much sitting down at Rikers.

336
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,843
Listen, Thorpe security called.

337
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:53,353
You're finished with 
that video equipment, right?

338
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,193
Take a look at this.

339
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,027
What?

340
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,975
Let's travel back in time 
a few minutes.

341
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,081
Yeah?

342
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,318
The desk clerk, Terry Wilde, 
said he came over to look for celebrities.

343
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,386
So why is he looking 
in the opposite direction...

344
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,752
for five minutes? 
And why this?

345
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,524
They looked 
right at each other.

346
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,233
And Wilde watches Ramsay 
all the way out.

347
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:43,508
THORPE PALACE HOTEL
726 WEST 49TH STREET
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8

348
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,578
Terry Wilde has been terminated.

349
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,646
What'd he do...

350
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:51,883
aside from keeping the victim from the 
cameras, thereby saving your five-star ass?

351
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:56,054
He gave us no choice. He hasn't shown 
up for work since the event.

352
00:20:56,054 --> 00:21:00,492
How convenient. The only employee 
that can testify in court.

353
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,628
What you're inferring is preposterous.

354
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,997
Implying. You did infer what he implied.

355
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,332
But on the bright side, 
you did infer correctly.

356
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:11,790
Do you have Wilde's current address, 
or did that disappear, too?

357
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,502
It's in his file...

358
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,508
which you may keep.

359
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,812
He lives at 1634 Broadway.

360
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,149
Not unless he's one of the nuts lobbying 
for yet another extension of Cats.

361
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,917
That's the Winter Garden Theater.

362
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,152
Don't ask.

363
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,021
Why would he give a bogus address?

364
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,285
Why, indeed? 
What else you got?

365
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,852
Former employment.

366
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:39,040
THE PARK SHERIDAN HOTEL
12 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8

367
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,901
Hi, we need to speak to a supervisor.

368
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,368
Mr. Fitzpatrick.

369
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:49,665
We need to ask you 
about a former employee. Terry Wilde.

370
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,578
- Take it you had a problem with Terry?
- No, never.

371
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,749
Under what circumstances 
did he leave? / Terry never left.

372
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,877
I'm Terry Wilde. 
What did I do?

373
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,228
So who is this desk clerk, 
Terry Wilde? / Not a clue.

374
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,298
Explains his reticence to testify in court. 
He's working some angle.

375
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:16,668
Yeah, which he aborts when he becomes 
a witness in an unconnected crime?

376
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,237
- Come on, what are the odds?
- I don't know, astronomical?

377
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:23,608
Front desk, room key, no forced entry. 
Put me down for $100 on "connected."

378
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,243
I'll put his photo out there.

379
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,609
Benson, Stabler. A minute?

380
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,721
This is Mr. Tupper.

381
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,822
- Hi. 
- Hello.

382
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,991
He's an actuary 
for Mr. Thorpe's insurance carrier.

383
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:45,097
Mr. Tupper was just asking how strong 
the Miller case against Ramsay is.

384
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,398
And why is that?

385
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,067
The hotel, while admitting no liability...

386
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,053
is considering making restitution.

387
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:53,105
That's big of them.

388
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,273
Fiscal sense 
in these litigious times.

389
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:58,377
Which Mr. Thorpe would settle 
out of court.

390
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,544
And out of the papers.

391
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,147
I just crunch the numbers.

392
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,815
And put price tags 
on people's lives.

393
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,918
I simply follow 
the actuarial charts.

394
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,554
They cover 
every conceivable contingency.

395
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,613
Oh, yeah? 
What's a dead cop worth?

396
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,783
I'll need rank and age at death.

397
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:19,552
RIKERS ISLAND
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11

398
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,701
What's his name?

399
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,975
I don't know. Is this the guy 
you think did it?

400
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,779
He's your partner. 
He gave you her room key, didn't he?

401
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,348
What? No, 
she gave it to me.

402
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:40,613
They checked out your story. 
Nobody at the bar remembers seeing you.

403
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,188
I got a forgettable face.

404
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,191
Mr. Ramsay, we will find your partner, 
with or without your help.

405
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,927
I'm sure he will be willing 
to take the deal we're offering you.

406
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,463
My client maintains his innocence.

407
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,199
You're facing rape-one with 
a prior felony conviction.

408
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,202
Given the degree of excessive force, 
you're looking at 25 years.

409
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:01,968
Why won't you listen? 
I don't have a partner.

410
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,334
What are you offering?

411
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,975
If he gives up his partner, 
I'll recommend some leniency.

412
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,382
Well? What's it gonna be?

413
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,057
Looks like we'll be taking 
our chances at trial.

414
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,265
This is so wrong.

415
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:36,107
DELANCEY ARMS HOTEL
313 DELANCEY STREET
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12

416
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,210
It's $20 for a tip-off.

417
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,746
If this guy turns out to be 
our Terry Wilde, he'll give you $30.

418
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,850
He's not a logged-in informant. 
This comes out of my pocket.

419
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,984
You sure it's the guy?

420
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,854
Like I said, as soon as the guy showed 
me the picture, I said "2E."

421
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,989
I mean, if it's not him, 
it's his twin brother.

422
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,658
- We don't pay out for brothers.
- No, it's him!

423
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,162
He wasn't by any chance wearing 
desk clerk uniform when he checked in?

424
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,665
Like I said, when he signed in, 
it wasn't Terry Wilde.

425
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,502
The ID said Michael Berkman.

426
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,527
I'm telling you, 
that's the guy.

427
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:12,640
What? / Yeah, it's the manager. 
You got a phone call.

428
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,276
You get a name?

429
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,472
Police!

430
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,285
Is there a problem?

431
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,354
Yeah, you didn't give 
the hotel two weeks notice.

432
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,588
Shame on you, 
Mr. Wilde.

433
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,690
His Wilde days are over. 
This is Mr. Berkman now.

434
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,592
Got a lot of names there, 
don't you, fella?

435
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,761
You got no right to come in here. 
Get the hell out!

436
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,197
Yes, okay, we will. 
But you're coming with us.

437
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,632
You can't do this!

438
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,122
Judge says we can.

439
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:41,540
Detective, I got 
a shady-looking skell up in 4F.

440
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,004
- Any interest?
- Yeah, okay.

441
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,847
I don't know what kind of hold 
this guy has on Ramsay...

442
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,782
but he won't give up 
his partner's name.

443
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,350
It's Michael Berkman.

444
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,853
Fin and Munch picked him up 
at a fleabag on Delancey.

445
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,355
We're running his prints 
right now.

446
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:01,026
If you have no connection to Ramsay, 
why'd you use a false identity at the hotel?

447
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:04,496
To get work. 
He had a great resume. / She.

448
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,532
I got it off the Internet. 
I was desperate for a job.

449
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,634
It was a good one. 
So why'd you leave?

450
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,936
Is quitting against the law?

451
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,239
It is highly suspect, following so closely 
the commission of a crime.

452
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,608
You have nothing connecting 
my client to your rapist.

453
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,644
We have a detective and an ADA 
with him right now.

454
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,379
Trust me, 
you wanna spill first.

455
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:25,517
I swear I'm not partners with any rapist. 
I never met Russell Ramsay.

456
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,651
I never gave him a key.

457
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,553
Mr. Berkman, you helped facilitate a rape.

458
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,989
Do you realize we could charge you 
as a co-conspirator?

459
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:36,242
Please! The most you got 
is criminal impersonation. A misdemeanor.

460
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,892
Guys, a minute of your time.

461
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:51,576
Your Michael Berkman, formerly Terry Wilde, 
is in reality Kyle Kivlahan...

462
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,745
disreputable roofer and petty thief.

463
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,580
What's his connection to Ramsay?

464
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,116
His connection is not 
to Ramsay. It's to Beau.

465
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,418
They went to the same high school 
and juvenile facilities

466
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,120
down in North Carolina.

467
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,989
Looks like these guys are partners.

468
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,822
You saying her own brother 
set her up to be raped?

469
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:14,099
I just got off the phone with Tupper. 
The brother is threatening a lawsuit.

470
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,067
$10 million.

471
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,774
THORPE PALACE HOTEL
726 WEST 49TH STREET
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13

472
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,743
Beau took the girls shopping.

473
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,878
We're doing everything we can 
to keep Siobhan busy.

474
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,648
Otherwise, I think 
she'd go crazy.

475
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,051
Sounds like a great brother. 
Have they always been close?

476
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:38,123
Actually, they just got back in touch. 
He left home when she was Tara's age.

477
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,725
Why was he estranged 
from his family?

478
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:45,163
I don't know the whole story. 
He was 16. He was a kid.

479
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,098
When did he reconcile?

480
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,535
He never got to. Their parents died 
a couple of months ago...

481
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,904
and he was determined 
to make it up to Siobhan.

482
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,305
Was that the point of this trip?

483
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,475
Yeah, family reunion.

484
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,411
Pretty serious boo-boo 
you got there.

485
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,614
Tara gave me first aid.

486
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,916
Guess I'm a little too old 
for the jungle gym.

487
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,353
Your husband called 
this place "Hotel Hell."

488
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,954
I'm surprised 
you haven't moved out.

489
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,752
Oh, we're in a different room, 
of course!

490
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,697
What, I do the wrong room, 
or is this rapist going door to door now?

491
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,167
No, just lift every print you can. 
We're trying to place Ramsay in here.

492
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:26,179
It's a long shot. Odds are Beau 
met with him outside this hotel.

493
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:28,039
We've been assuming 
that Ramsay got a room key...

494
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,442
from our multiple-personality 
desk clerk.

495
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,110
But maybe he didn't even 
need a key.

496
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,839
These are adjoining rooms.

497
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,942
Okay, Mrs. Miller had Siobhan 
at the pool...

498
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,480
and Beau let him in through here.

499
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,506
Or here.

500
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,591
We got a blood stain.

501
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,776
Harry. / We know Beau was at the party 
from the videotape.

502
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,878
Mrs. Miller, though, 
was definitely in this room.

503
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,312
Making it even more 
of a family affair.

504
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,609
How'd you meet Beau?

505
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,190
Beau who?

506
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,259
What about Patricia Ann?

507
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,996
Look, I don't know her. 
And I swear to God I never touched her.

508
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,331
You gotta get me out of here.

509
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,730
Kyle Kivlahan?

510
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,136
Okay, yes, I know him.

511
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,626
How do you know him?

512
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,995
Please?

513
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:41,579
I'll say anything. 
You just tell me what you want to hear.

514
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,549
Like you told Shelly 
you didn't rape Siobhan?

515
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,618
I love Shelly. 
I never lie to her.

516
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,954
Really? 'Cause when she found out 
you had sex with Siobhan...

517
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,524
it came as a bit 
of a surprise.

518
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:56,194
Look, I'm guilty of bad judgment, all right? 
That's it.

519
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,630
Siobhan propositioned me, 
I accepted.

520
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,793
Now I get the crap 
beat out of me every day for it.

521
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,270
You gotta help me.

522
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,967
You've done a stint before. 
Didn't you learn how to cover your back?

523
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,547
It's worse this time. Come on. 
Rape and battery of a minor?

524
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,649
Look, I can't sleep, 
all right?

525
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,637
I gotta stay awake at night 
so I don't get ambushed.

526
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:25,123
You should have remembered the pecking 
order... before you raped Siobhan.

527
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,920
I didn't rape her!

528
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,860
Try to stay 
out of fights, huh?

529
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,786
How?

530
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,829
I can't look at a guy 
without getting jumped.

531
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,182
Munch. Benson just filled me in. 
You got anything new?

532
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,417
Something's not right.

533
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,785
With the brother?

534
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:54,752
No, Ramsay.

535
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,955
Don't tell me that. 
Ramsay's our only slam-dunk.

536
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,957
It's Kyle and Beau 
I need more on to indict.

537
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,327
Have you noticed how the bad guys are 
multiplying exponentially on this case?

538
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,761
I just wanna make sure 
we get 'em right.

539
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,263
It doesn't get righter 
than Ramsay.

540
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,266
We've got the victim's ID, 
we've got his DNA, not to mention his prior.

541
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,669
- Not-to-mention-his-prior came to see me. 
- Shelly Leevak? Why?

542
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,240
She came to defend her rapist. 
How many times do you see that?

543
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,375
I've seen battered wives 
defend their husbands.

544
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,845
I've seen abused children defend 
their parents. You name it, I've seen it.

545
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,905
Do me a favor, will you? 
Concentrate on Beau and Kyle.

546
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,988
The flowers were really nice.

547
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,457
Olivia, what are you doing here?

548
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,659
I'm just working 
the rest of my shift.

549
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,127
I told you to take time off.

550
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,229
I don't want any time off.

551
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,356
At least take 
the rest of the day.

552
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,408
Look...

553
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,245
Captain, it took me years to accept 
the fact that my mother was an alcoholic...

554
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:58,416
and, when I did, 
I had to accept all the consequences.

555
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,850
I can handle it. 
I just need to work.

556
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:13,354
We're pretty sure Siobhan's brother 
and sister-in-law set her up.

557
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,367
I wanna talk to Siobhan.

558
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,536
No. She can't know yet.

559
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,571
We can't take the chance 
it'll tip them off.

560
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,563
Chance of what? Chance that 
I'll blow the case?

561
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,611
Look, you're in no condition.

562
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:31,809
Captain, I'm fine. 
Let me do my job.

563
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,488
You're okay staying here?

564
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,598
I just wanna go home.

565
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,634
I think you should.

566
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,125
Beau wants to get everything 
settled first.

567
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,666
I can't believe 
he's suing them.

568
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,068
How old were you 
when your brother left home?

569
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,315
Like four.

570
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:09,087
So, you never knew him 
growing up? / No.

571
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,783
And, how is it that 
he got back into your life?

572
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:18,688
Well, when our parents died, 
Beau came back.

573
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,529
He said he'll take care of me.

574
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,131
Sorry, I'll be right back.
Okay.

575
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,320
No!

576
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,623
I don't think that's enough.

577
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,426
You just remember, 
no matter what you settle for...

578
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:25,862
I am getting my $2 million, 
'cause I sure as hell did my part.

579
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:33,061
So we move Siobhan 
from victim...

580
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,338
to perp.

581
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,507
Along with her brother, 
Beau Miller.

582
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,510
Yeah, a.k.a., Clayton Farnsworth. 
Forgery and fraud.

583
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,314
You know, I talked to North Carolina. 
Nothing but a petty con artist.

584
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:47,618
He works the beach tourists in summer, 
home improvement scams in the off-season.

585
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,021
Married to Patricia Ann Miller.

586
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,391
The bloody print we found on the adjoining 
door we thought was Ramsay's?

587
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,060
Lab ran it against the elimination prints. 
It's Patricia Ann's.

588
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,030
But what was she doing there? 
Why risk contaminating the crime scene?

589
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,466
To make it look like one. 
She trashed the place.

590
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,368
Not to mention our phony 
desk clerk, Kyle Kivlahan.

591
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,871
A.k.a. Terry Wilde 
and Michael Berkman.

592
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,007
Who we now know to be 
Beau Miller's second cousin.

593
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,443
Which also makes him 
Siobhan's cousin. / Yes.

594
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,378
One big happy family of grifters.

595
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:18,082
Thorpe is the mark. Let's get arrest 
warrants for the Miller family.

596
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,485
Better call Children's Services. 
There's a 4-year-old.

597
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,919
Thorpe would rather pay...

598
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:25,423
than having us drag three handcuffed 
suspects through his family-friendly lobby.

599
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,258
We won't be taking them in the hotel.

600
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,760
Excuse me, we haven't 
connected all the dots yet.

601
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,828
Who's left?

602
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,764
Ramsay. He's not a Miller. 
He's not from North Carolina.

603
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,231
How does he fit in?

604
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,025
WHEDON & MAYFIELD
INSURANCE COMPANY
46 WHITEHALL STREET
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14

605
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:46,008
We're here to pick up a check. 
Beau Miller? Regarding Siobhan?

606
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:52,447
Mr. Miller's here to see you.

607
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,349
Mr. Miller.

608
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,028
My supervisor actually needs 
to handle transactions of this magnitude.

609
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,256
Come with me.

610
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:11,102
I can take your little girl 
to our day-care facility if you'd like.

611
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,904
This won't take long, 
will it?

612
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,974
We need to go over some delicate issues. 
It might be best.

613
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,276
All right.

614
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,344
Okay, now, Mommy will be back 
in just a second...

615
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,180
and I want you to go 
with the nice lady.

616
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,704
- Okay? 
- Okay.

617
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,786
Mr. Mayfield? 
These are the Millers.

618
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,892
Thank you, Tupper. 
You can go.

619
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,928
- Welcome.
- Hello.

620
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,430
Please, I can't tell you 
how glad I am...

621
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,667
to be putting this unpleasant situation 
behind us.

622
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,369
You just need to sign these.

623
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:52,710
It is a detailed account 
of the event...as you relayed it to us.

624
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,541
And we get that check today?

625
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,113
Unless you wanna 
drop the claim.

626
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,959
We're done in here.

627
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,598
What is this?

628
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:23,007
You're under arrest for conspiracy, 
extortion, and grand larceny.

629
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:27,311
No one say anything without lawyers. 
Nothing, Siobhan.

630
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,414
I don't understand. 
What'd I do?

631
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,683
Why don't you tell me more 
about your dead parents?

632
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:36,914
They're alive and doing time. 
Investment scams, wasn't it?

633
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,925
I was ashamed. That's why 
I said they were dead.

634
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,929
You ashamed of your age too? 
'Cause we know you're 23, not 17.

635
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,193
And we know 
you participated in this.

636
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,135
Beau made me.

637
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:55,866
You don't know what they put me through. 
I didn't know what to do.

638
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:59,744
- Please!
- You're good.

639
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,179
- But I've been taken by better.
- No!

640
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,048
I want a deal.

641
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,857
Our cousin Kyle's job 
was to get inside.

642
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,260
Once he was, he bumped 
a confirmed reservation and got us in.

643
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,251
So how's Ramsay 
related to you?

644
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,233
He's not.

645
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:25,603
We found him 
on the Sex Offenders Registry.

646
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,672
The sex was consensual. 
We set him up.

647
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:31,698
And beating you to a pulp 
was what, foreplay?

648
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:35,780
That was Patty Ann. 
She came in after he left.

649
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,583
It hurt like hell, 
but she did a damn good job.

650
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,951
I mean, 
that's pretty much it.

651
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,788
Timed it so I got downstairs 
right in the middle of the opening...

652
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,757
and then Kyle was in place to stop me 
just before I hit the press.

653
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,860
Why? Wouldn't that have made 
a stronger civil suit?

654
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,229
Oh, maybe, 
but those take years.

655
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,599
I mean, we knew Thorpe would pay 
to keep it quiet, you know?

656
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,335
And gag money pays real quick.

657
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,271
You'll have to allocute to all 
of this when you plead guilty.

658
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:04,900
Testify against all the other players, 
you're looking at probation.

659
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:11,210
What was going through your mind when 
you were taking that beating?

660
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,980
How I was gonna 
spend all that money.

661
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,655
She get the deal?

662
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,090
Yeah.
³×

663
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,092
She admit to being 
the ringleader?

664
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,695
Four separate interviews, 
one common thread: Siobhan set this up.

665
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,764
The original scam was planned 
with the parents.

666
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,966
Once they got pinched, 
she needed a replacement family.

667
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,668
So she calls up 
her long-lost brother.

668
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,036
Who, if you hear him 
tell it...

669
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,505
had to be browbeaten 
into making the jump into the big time.

670
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,840
And then she gets probation?

671
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,641
I'll tell you, it gets worse:

672
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,477
She set Ramsay up.

673
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,480
Now, we gotta call Corrections, 
have him produced and released.

674
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,682
I guarantee you 
he's looking at another 24 hours...

675
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,717
before he makes it 
through the red tape.

676
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,810
Then we need 
to put a rush on it.

677
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:52,790
ALLOCUTION HEARING
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15

678
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,960
Beau made sure the police and hospital 
documented the rape...

679
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,631
and then waited for them to arrest Ramsay 
and find out he was a convicted rapist.

680
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:04,201
And, and soon as they did, 
Beau began the con.

681
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,566
That's about it.

682
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,440
Are the People satisfied?

683
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,574
Miss Cabot?

684
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:15,704
Could Miss Miller elaborate on how 
Russell Ramsay was enrolled in the scam?

685
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:19,150
That's covered under 
the agreement, right? / Right.

686
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,687
We just looked on the Internet 
for a sex offender.

687
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,657
I mean, they got a whole website 
with pictures and MOs...

688
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,593
and I picked Ramsay because 
he wasn't as gross as the others.

689
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,129
I mean, he didn't look dangerous 
and he liked them young.

690
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,832
How did you go about 
seducing him?

691
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,667
Our cousin Kyle 
was the advance man.

692
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,603
I mean, he followed him around 
a few days and got his schedule down.

693
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,772
And then, I just showed up at his bar.

694
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,141
I gave him the duplicate room key 
that Kyle had made...

695
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,510
and I told him when to be in my room.

696
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:51,446
The plan hinged on Ramsay showing up. 
How could you be certain he would?

697
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,852
He's an ex-con with a loser job 
who likes young girls.

698
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,787
I mean, it's a no-brainer.

699
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,618
Still, something could've gone wrong.

700
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,460
I would've Plan-B'd it.

701
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,927
What is Plan B?

702
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:09,361
Honey, no man passes up free sex.

703
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:16,607
Siobhan Miller, you've entered 
a change of plea from not guilty to guilty.

704
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:20,911
Are you pleading guilty because you are, 
in fact, guilty of the charges?

705
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,179
Yes, Your Honor.

706
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,682
Given your life-long vocation 
of flimflamming...

707
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:29,119
this court is loathe to put you on the stand 
of your co-conspirators' trials.

708
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,656
However, since your plea seems 
acceptable to the DA...

709
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,059
this court will sentence you 
to five years probation.

710
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,598
What are you doing?

711
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,300
Can't tell you how much 
I've enjoyed watching you hang yourself.

712
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,569
What? We had a deal. 
You can't go back on it.

713
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,271
Russell Ramsay 
was attacked at Rikers.

714
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,739
He was beaten and raped.

715
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,474
He was killed.

716
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,510
Your false allegation 
put him there.

717
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,745
Under the law, 
you're responsible for his death.

718
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:59,044
And manslaughter ain't covered 
under your deal, sweetheart.

719
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,388
They got her, Munch. 
She played right into it.

720
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,090
What are the chances it'll stick?

721
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,193
Cabot'll get her allocution testimony 
in front of the grand jury.

722
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,728
No way they won't indict.

723
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:11,829
That's great.

724
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,964
John. We got her.

725
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,454
Yeah? At what price?

726
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,112
UNIFIED SHIPPING
REGO PARK, NEW YORK
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16

727
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,917
What are you doing here? 
I thought I told you everything.

728
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,685
I know you did. 
And you were right.

729
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,420
What? You mean...

730
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,256
We know that Ramsay didn't rape 
that woman. He's been cleared.

731
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,621
Thank God.

732
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,599
What?

733
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,602
Can you take a break for a few minutes, 
have a cup of coffee with me?

734
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,900
I need to talk to you 
about something.

735
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,899
What?
