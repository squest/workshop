8
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,968
Hello?

9
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:05,387
I'm here to fix the toilet.

10
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,938
Miss Owens?

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,986
Mary, Mother of God.

12
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,023
- Who turned on the radio?
- It was on when she was found.

13
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,893
- Okay. And she is?
- Marnie Owens, age 37, lived alone.

14
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,495
The doc says she was raped.

15
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,564
The door doesn't look like
it was forced open.

16
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,132
- Yeah.
- The lock worked this morning.

17
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,600
That's the super.
He found her.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,519
Kill the radio.

19
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,872
I came to fix the toilet.

20
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,173
She call you?

21
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,844
Last night.
She said it was keeping her awake.

22
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,047
Then the boiler goes out.
I had to fix the heat first.

23
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,182
Told her I'd be here today.

24
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,718
- Bedroom door open or closed?
- Closed.

25
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,789
I heard music playing, like maybe
she slept through the alarm or something.

26
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,093
I figured I better knock on it, you know,
in case I walked in on her undressed.

27
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,229
Detectives.

28
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,330
Give us a minute.

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,424
I'm not going nowhere.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,203
Fluids and bruising around the genitals.

31
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,241
- Cause of death?
- Manual strangulation.

32
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,711
Bruising around the neck,
petechial hemorrhaging.

33
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,946
Dead about 10, 12 hours.

34
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,014
She put up a fight.

35
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,116
You get anything from
underneath the fingernails?

36
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,851
Nothing I can see.

37
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,220
We'll know more after the autopsy.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,635
Don't pick it up.

39
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,012
Elliot.

40
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,267
This is Marnie. You know the drill.

41
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,905
Marnie, it's Ruth. It's 10:00.
We're starting to worry.

42
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,073
Please call as soon as
you get this. Bye.

43
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,905
Caller ID says New York
City schools. / Olivia.

44
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,257
Her wall of fame.

45
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:15,480
Outstanding teacher, 1998.

46
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,691
School's out.

00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,605
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/02/02

60
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,820
So, Marnie Owens survives a tour of duty
in one of the city's worst high schools...

61
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,588
but she isn't safe in
her own apartment.

62
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,201
No doorman. All the doer had to do
was follow her in.  / Or be invited.

63
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:21,865
- No forced entry into her apartment.
- A boyfriend?

64
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,129
If she had one,
there were no pictures.

65
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,864
Plenty of pictures of
students, though.

66
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,933
Her dining room,
set up like a mini classroom.

67
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,801
She seemed like
a very dedicated teacher.

68
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,803
So we can't rule out a student.

69
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,971
What'd CSU turn up?

70
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,975
Traces of semen on the bed and two
colors of hair...one matching the victim's.

71
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:40,079
Guy who found her, building super.
Record's clean, alibi checks.

72
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,248
Also found a half-empty
bottle of Prozac.

73
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,784
We had her job,
we might all be depressed.

74
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,754
- Any therapy appointments in there?
- No. Just tutoring sessions.

75
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,724
Last one was with Ethan Chance,
last night, 6:00.

76
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,260
You two, go over to
Owens' school, all right?

77
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,765
See if one of her hard case students was
giving her more trouble than usual.

78
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,082
Poor Munch and Fin
get to canvas in the cold.

DOUGLAS MACARTHUR
HIGH SCHOOL
201 RIVINGTON STREET
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24

80
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,006
Marnie was special.

81
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,310
The kind of teacher I'd like to clone.

82
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,346
She took 10th graders reading
at a third grade level...

83
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,317
and got them through Regents Exam
and into college.

84
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,353
Her most challenging students
she tutored at home.

85
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,388
- No charge.
- That's dedication.

86
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,158
Takes creativity to
motivate kids like that.

87
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,193
Marnie did things like...

88
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:32,598
having her seniors write plays
about their lives.

89
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,469
Marnie helped them articulate
their fears and dreams.

90
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,304
What about her personal life?

91
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,406
I'm surprised she had one.

92
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:44,677
We were friends here, but Marnie never
shared much about her life outside.

93
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,613
- Did she seem depressed?
- No.

94
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,950
She missed a meeting on Friday.
First time in five years.

95
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,188
I asked her if anything was wrong. She
said it was nothing she couldn't handle.

96
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,623
In her lesson planner,
she had a tutoring session...

97
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,160
- scheduled with an Ethan Chance?
- One of her prodigies.

98
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,830
Kid from a drug corner,
has a real shot at college now.

99
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,807
We'll need to talk to him.

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,737
This was Marnie's room.

101
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,828
I'll get Ethan for you.

102
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,709
- You cops?
- Yes.

103
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:29,355
My little girl is gonna graduate
because of Miss Owens.

104
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,290
We're sorry for your loss.

105
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,426
It's not just my loss.

106
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,990
Look at these kids.

107
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,031
Please find the man
that did this to us.

108
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,651
We're doing everything we can.

109
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,072
Excuse me.

110
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,174
Ethan never showed up
for school this morning.

111
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,909
- We'll need his address.
- Of course.

112
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,043
Do you know his parents?

113
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:55,191
No father. Mother's a teller at
a bank on Canal and Lafayette.

114
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,317
I thought he went to school early.

115
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,286
Principal said he never showed up.

116
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,993
Damn that boy.
Miss Owens is not gonna tolerate that.

117
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,193
Miss Owens was murdered.

118
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,828
Oh, dear God. No.

119
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,063
Ethan had a tutoring session
with her last night.

120
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,865
We thought he might
be able to help us.

121
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,535
I owe her a lot.
She turned Ethan around.

122
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:19,238
Showed him there were other possibilities
besides slinging dope on some corner.

123
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,041
I told Ethan,
I don't visit nobody in jail.

124
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,843
What time did he come
home last night?

125
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,780
Around 11:00.
On school nights, that's his...No.

126
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,249
He's been in trouble for drugs,
but he's straightened out.

127
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,884
He's a good boy.

128
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,121
Did Ethan say anything
about his tutoring session?

129
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,190
He just said Miss Owens yelled at him.

130
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,327
I asked him why, he runs
into his room and slams the door.

131
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,962
I wake up this morning and he's gone.

132
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,531
Any idea where?

133
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,335
When he cut school, he used to hang
out on the corner with some losers.

134
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,971
Suffolk and Rivington.

135
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,507
She lived next door for six years.

136
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:58,744
Came to visit me at the rehab hospital
after I fell last year.

137
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,946
You knew her well?

138
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,149
She was such a nice girl.

139
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,419
Not like that other one,
down the hall. That kurva.

140
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,820
Yiddish for whore.

141
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,757
Did you notice anybody come in or out
of Marnie's apartment last night?

142
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,360
Well, one of her students.

143
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,798
Yeah. He went in around suppertime.
Looked like a hood.

144
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,335
- Can you describe him?
- He was a Black kid.

145
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,137
Wearing a kind of a brown jacket.

146
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:29,275
- You hear anything?
- Some loud voices while I was eating.

147
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:33,412
- What were they saying?
- My hearing is as old as I am, Officer.

148
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:38,150
My son had to buy me special headphones
for the TV just to hear my Rosie.

149
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,221
Did you know any of Marnie's
boyfriends? / What boyfriends?

150
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,858
The only one I ever saw was...
What was his name?

151
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:50,730
Byron. A doctor, no less.
But he hasn't come around for a while.

152
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,133
- What about family?
- Her parents passed away.

153
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,869
All she had left was
her brother, Jordan.

154
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,231
But I haven't seen him for years.

155
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,546
It's her.

156
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,083
My God.

157
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,920
Now I told her not to live in
a building without a doorman.

158
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,556
- We need to ask you a few questions.
- Can't it wait?

159
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,493
- I understand you're distraught.
- Just one question.

160
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,262
Marnie's neighbor mentioned
a boyfriend, some doctor.

161
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:27,166
Boyfriend. Try affair.
He was married.

162
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:34,540
- This affair have a name?
- Byron Marks. Surgeon over at Bellevue.

163
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,984
I told her to stay away
from a married guy.

164
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,348
We ain't doing nothing.

165
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,050
Hi. You guys seen Ethan around?

166
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,384
Ethan Hawke?

167
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,752
You got the wrong 'hood, man.

168
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,620
Don't play us.

169
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,291
You talking about Little E?

170
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,126
He's too good for us now, right?

171
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,729
Ever since he got his "edumacation."

172
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,632
Is there some kind of school holiday
I don't know about?

173
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,900
I got the flu.

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,017
Yeah? What about you?

175
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,837
It's contagious.

176
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,706
We're gonna ask you one more time.

177
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,175
We don't like the answer,
we're gonna play show-and-tell.

178
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,978
You want us to go
through your pockets?

179
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,913
We don't look good talking to y'all.

180
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:18,050
Yeah, we told y'all.
What's up with this? / Okay.

181
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,755
Look. Yo, last night he was talking about
that teacher of his. He was down about it.

182
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,890
- Where was that?
- Schoolyard.

183
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,727
- What time?
- I don't know. I don't got a watch.

184
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,563
- Yeah? What did he say?
- He was riled up about it.

185
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,065
- Why?
- They had some type of fight.

186
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,901
- What'd he say about the fight?
- Ain't say nothing about the fight.

187
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,718
He just said he had to go home
before his mother came looking for him.

188
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:43,676
BELLEVUE HOSPITAL
462 FIRST AVENUE
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24

189
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,512
I was separated.
I wouldn't call it an affair.

190
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,816
Was Marnie the reason
you and your wife split?

191
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,919
That was coming long
before I knew Marnie.

192
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,321
How long did you two go out?

193
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,557
About a half a year. We met in
a mentoring program for inner-city kids.

194
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,059
When's the last time you saw her?

195
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,994
The night we broke up.
Three months ago.

196
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,031
- What happened?
- I was looking for a relationship.

197
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:09,268
She wasn't. / My experience is usually
the other way around.

198
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,138
I'm a nester. I was more than ready
to settle down with Marnie.

199
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,674
But the only commitment
she wanted was with her kids.

200
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,944
We have to ask. Where were you
last night around 10:00?

201
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:23,249
I was at dinner with my new girlfriend.
Spent the night at her apartment.

202
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:28,320
- She a nester?
- Just like me.

203
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,757
I looked everywhere,
called everyone I know, all his friends.

204
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,826
What else can I do?

205
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,863
Well, would you mind if
we took a look around Ethan's room?

206
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,650
It's that door right there.

207
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,373
Your kids keep their rooms
this clean?

208
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,242
- I wish.
- Ethan's into sports.

209
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,793
I make sure his schoolwork
comes first.

210
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,159
Olivia.

211
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,726
Looks like Miss Owens was teaching
her students more than just English.

212
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,196
- Facts of life.
- What?

213
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,766
Good lord.
What was she doing to my son?

214
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,935
Ethan's mother doesn't know
what he was wearing...

215
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,803
except that his brown parka's missing.

216
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,505
We thinking he's the teacher's pet?

217
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,040
The teacher doing the petting.

218
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,576
She seduces him, gets what she wants,
then dumps him.

219
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,411
Teenage hormones plus
jealousy and rage?

220
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,514
I'd call that a potentially
deadly combination.

221
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,584
This picture didn't get
on the Internet by accident.

222
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,953
Get Marnie's PC down
to computer crimes...

223
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,256
find out what and who else
might be on that hard drive.

224
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,724
The ex's story track?

225
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,427
Said he was in the sack
with his latest squeeze Sunday night.

226
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,795
We're still trying to reach her.

227
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,929
What about the funeral?

228
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,432
Private. School's sponsoring
a memorial service tomorrow.

229
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,633
You know, Ethan's probably
feeling guilty.

230
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:51,203
Remorseful.
He could be there.

231
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,774
All right. We'll have a detail
outside the church, just in case he is.

232
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,910
But for now don't rule out
any other possibilities.

233
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,398
Photo unit will be there as well.

234
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:03,795
ST.JAMES CHURCH
240 E. 12TH STREET
THURSDAY, JANUARY 25

235
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,099
Four of us and hundreds of them?

236
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,434
What, you don't like those odds?

237
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,872
Sounds like lottery odds to me.
Least this is almost over.

238
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,013
I got a brown jacket heading west
toward the church.

239
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,320
I see him.

240
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,008
Negative.

241
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,346
I got another one. Brown parka.
Heading east towards the church.

242
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,199
Hood's up. Can't see the face.

243
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,622
Him. Zoom in on him.

244
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,891
It's him. Fin, he's coming right at you.

245
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,342
I got him.

246
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,761
Move!

247
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,312
Making me run on my bad knee.

248
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,413
I didn't do anything.

249
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,848
Your mother's looking for you.

250
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,316
You're under arrest.

251
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,184
You have the right to remain silent.

252
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,319
You give up that right...

253
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,188
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

254
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,690
You have the right to an attorney.

255
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,646
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed for you.

256
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,162
Why'd you run?

257
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,977
We found this in your room.
You want to explain it to us?

258
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,860
When did you and Miss Owens
start knocking boots? / What?

259
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,089
Come on, a hot teacher like her,
she comes onto you,

260
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,485
you get something going...
then she wants to turn it off. / No!

261
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,820
You couldn't stand it.

262
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,456
But you couldn't stay away,
so what do you do?

263
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,291
You show up to her service.

264
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,360
I felt bad.

265
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,030
I felt bad because
the last time I saw her...

266
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,398
I called her a whore.

267
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,001
'Cause she dumped you.

268
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,703
Y'all got it all wrong, man!

269
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,109
So tell us what's right.

270
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,613
Come here.

271
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,949
You were the last person
seen with her...

272
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,351
you got this picture...

273
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,986
okay, you're on the run.

274
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,821
They line up the dogs, man.

275
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,309
If you don't give us something right away,
they're gonna turn the dogs loose.

276
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,763
Little Camp gave me that picture.

277
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,399
What's his real name?

278
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,102
Marcus Cole.

279
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:47,106
Fool said he found it messing around
on some porn site on the Internet.

280
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,576
She was advertising for guys
to have sex with her.

281
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,646
Marcus said he was gonna spread that
picture around school to everybody.

282
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,882
Why would he want to do that?

283
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,551
'Cause Miss Owens was
on his case about...

284
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:04,656
not doing his work...
cutting class.

285
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,042
Tell us what happened
at the tutoring session?

286
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:14,142
I showed her the picture.

287
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,507
I tried to warn her about
what Marcus was gonna do.

288
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:26,945
And she starts yelling. Yelling at me
like it's my fault or something.

289
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,048
She tells me to get out.

290
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,518
Well, that must have made you angry.

291
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,888
Look, I didn't do anything, man.

292
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,990
I did nothing.
I was just trying to help her.

293
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,291
You disappeared.

294
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,837
I went back to apologize
the next morning before school...

295
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,034
and I get to her building
and you all were there.

296
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:53,595
So I asked some guy in the crowd,
what's going on and he says...

297
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,647
He says a woman was murdered...

298
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,817
on the third floor.

299
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,229
Miss Owens lived on the third floor.

300
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,563
She never judged me
when I was in trouble.

301
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,582
She told me I could be somebody.

302
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,273
I called her a whore.

303
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,498
- Ethan. Did Miss Owens ever touch you?
- It wasn't like that.

304
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:35,691
She never laid a hand on me.

305
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,220
Ethan didn't do this.

306
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,788
What about his friend?

307
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,022
Marcus Cole...

308
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:47,860
17, shoplifting, misdemeanor
assault and a string of drug busts.

309
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,228
Nothing to send him upstate.

310
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,064
Wait, we know this kid.

311
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,066
Well, it's flu boy. / Yeah.

312
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,401
It's one of the kids
from Rivington and Suffolk.

313
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,770
Munch, Fin, pick him up.

314
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,973
Flu better?

315
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,414
What you want with me, man?

316
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,512
Nice. I hear it's getting around.

317
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,579
Yeah. Thanks to you.

318
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,448
- So?
- So where'd you get it?

319
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,951
She was advertising on the Internet,
you know what I mean? I'm just a consumer.

320
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,821
Yeah. I bet you are.
But you wanted the real deal, huh?

321
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,989
You knew where to find it.

322
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,157
You saying I did it?

323
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,258
You didn't like her.

324
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,792
She wasn't gonna graduate me.

325
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,048
News flash. You gotta show
up to class to graduate.

326
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:25,697
You think I'd kill the bitch over that?

327
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,032
You spread this picture around.

328
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,433
Knew where she lived.

329
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,403
I ain't been near her place in months.

330
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,206
We know where you were
Sunday night, 10:00.

331
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,675
I was right where you found me.

332
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,043
You could ask my boys.

333
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,012
Prove it. Take a blood test.

334
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,495
Man, I'll take any test you want.

335
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,919
Well, that was too easy.

336
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,387
Tox screen came back.

337
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,989
Marnie didn't have Prozac
or anything else in her system.

338
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,391
Where are we on the brother?

339
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,293
Not exactly screaming for justice.

340
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,996
Well, it's time to pay him a visit.
Respectfully, please.

341
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,464
He didn't want to kill her.

342
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,166
Just her career.

343
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,946
Well, we gotta be looking
in the wrong place.

344
00:20:04,131 --> 00:20:06,939
COMPUTER CRIMES UNIT
1 POLICE PLAZA
FRIDAY, JANUARY 26

345
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,007
I mirrored her hard drive.

346
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:14,028
The history in this thing reads
like some bad porno flick.

347
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,715
The Luvstud's website?

348
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,850
That's where she ran the ad.

349
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,187
Welcome to the red light district
of the new millennium.

350
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,190
"Hot babe looking for ten hotter guys.

351
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,594
"I can take you all at once."

352
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,197
Riding through life on
the sex superhighway.

353
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,133
Hey, she save any of the responses?

354
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,348
If she stored her password,
I can tell you.

355
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,777
There they are. Everything
from the last month.

356
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,412
Print them.

357
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,784
Yeah, I wish you guys would
just leave me alone.

358
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,221
We need your help. Do you know
why your sister was on Prozac?

359
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,758
Maybe the shrink
I sent her to prescribed lt.

360
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,360
Look, I don't mean to sound cold...

361
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,031
but I've been preparing myself
for this for a long time.

362
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,368
You knew about her secret life?

363
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,404
Some people shoot heroin.

364
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,906
Marnie's drug of choice was sex.

365
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,642
She ever talk to you about it?

366
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,077
She didn't have to.

367
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:23,148
My room was right next to hers
when we were teenagers.

368
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,684
I heard everything.

369
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,986
Each time, a different guy.

370
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,155
She was self-destructive.

371
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,157
Your parents allowed this?

372
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:36,428
My mother died of cancer the year
after I was born.

373
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:40,599
Dear old Dad, when he wasn't at work...

374
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,835
was too drunk to care about anything else.

375
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,937
He ever abuse Marnie?

376
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,574
He never touched her.

377
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:54,146
But he just couldn't keep
his eyes off her chest.

378
00:21:54,146 --> 00:22:00,252
And he just couldn't keep his mouth shut
about how beautiful it was.

379
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,455
What could I do?

380
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,394
I was just a kid.

381
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:15,167
OFFICE OF DR.BENNETT ALSTON
668 MADISON AVENUE
FRIDAY, JANUARY 26

382
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,937
It's called covert incest.

383
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:23,041
You're a little girl.
Dad watches you take baths.

384
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,210
Tells you dirty jokes.

385
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,447
Mentions how great the sex was
last night with some woman.

386
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,816
Twisted way to teach
the birds and bees.

387
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:35,587
Then you hit puberty.
Daddy dearest admires your shape.

388
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:40,325
Leaves porn magazines in your room.
Buys you sexy lingerie.

389
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:44,162
Maybe takes you as his date
to a business dinner or a cocktail party.

390
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,931
And when little girl is
all grown up...

391
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,767
the only way she knows
how to relate to men is through sex.

392
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,703
- And Prozac helps?
- Prozac is for depression.

393
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,474
Sex addicts are consumed
by loneliness and despair.

394
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,109
Addicts are self-centered people.

395
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,844
Doesn't sound like teacher of the year.

396
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,846
You don't understand, Detective.

397
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:05,083
These people don't enjoy sex.
They're numb.

398
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,387
They're gripped by some force
they can't control.

399
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,523
It's like somebody who drinks too much,
snorts cocaine...

400
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,058
bets the house on the ponies.

401
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,061
And those addictions are
considered disorders.

402
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,163
But when you have to have sex
three times a day...

403
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,098
you're considered a pervert.

404
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:24,436
Sex addicts carry so much shame,
they're always looking for redemption.

405
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,639
So Marnie's dedication to
her students was her redemption.

406
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:32,393
What surprises me is that she was
able to keep her secret for so long.

407
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,348
Back in Baltimore,
I come into the office one day...

408
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,483
everybody's staring at me
like my fly's open.

409
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,584
I say, "What's up?"

410
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,520
They send me across the street
to a gallery.

411
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,622
One of my ex-girlfriends is
showing her work.

412
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,358
Centerpiece is a wall-sized
print of yours truly...

413
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,827
from his free-love days au naturel.

414
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,396
Serves you right for posing nude
in the first place.

415
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,098
That's what I get for sharing.

416
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,967
You must have some innermost secret.

417
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,503
I'm a Republican.

418
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:02,240
"I can go solo or duo,
but I prefer dirty dozen?"

419
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,043
162 different e-mail responses
to her ad.

420
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,645
That's a hell of a lot of subpoenas.

421
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,346
Psychiatrist give anything up?

422
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,848
Marnie had a sex jones.

423
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,317
Prozac was for the depression
associated with the addiction.

424
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,219
We're just learning
how she fed her habit.

425
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,955
She visited at least a dozen
sex sites on the web...

426
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,291
that have clubs where you can get up
close and personal.

427
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,760
There are LUDs that show
a lot of incoming calls...

428
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,276
from various pay phones...

429
00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:26,198
but the outgoings go an awful lot to...

430
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,934
a number registered to Pleasure Partners.

431
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,537
Which also owns a swingers club
called Flings down in SoHo.

432
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,773
You an expert?

433
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,893
I got that from her computer files.

434
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:41,049
FLINGS
222 PRINCE STREET
FRIDAY, JANUARY 26

435
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,389
- Welcome.
- Hi.

436
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,758
$85 a couple. Cash up front.

437
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:59,664
We give you a private room
to change and do whatever.

438
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,434
Olivia, you first.

439
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,537
Don't be nervous, dear.
We were all beginners once.

440
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,639
We're still beginners.

441
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,741
We're not doing anything
illegal here, Officers.

442
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,243
We're all consenting adults.

443
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:15,647
So why don't you tell us what you know
about this consenting adult?

444
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,083
Marnie's not welcome
here anymore.

445
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,620
Well, maybe you're too busy
to read the paper, but Marnie's dead.

446
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,989
Dead? How?

447
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,056
She was murdered.

448
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,791
And you think someone here did it.

449
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,593
Because we're all sexual deviants, right?

450
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,196
You said that Marnie wasn't
welcome here anymore. How come?

451
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,164
She didn't follow the rules.

452
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,699
You have rules?

453
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,669
She had a threesome
with two married men.

454
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,604
Started an affair with one of them.

455
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,842
So you don't approve of sex outside
the marriage unless it's done in this club?

456
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,845
Despite what you may think,
we're happily married.

457
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,202
One of our rules is,

458
00:25:48,202 --> 00:25:50,949
you have to preserve he relationship
with your primary partner...

459
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,217
or you can't participate.

460
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:57,071
We expelled Marnie and this gentlemen
when his wife told us about the affair.

461
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:58,390
And this gentleman is?

462
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,125
That's confidential. I'm sorry.

463
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,763
I'll tell you what, I'd be glad
to have the health department...

464
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:05,664
come on down here
and take a look around.

465
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:09,634
His name is Byron Marks.

466
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,435
Guess the doctor was in.

467
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,126
You said you met Marnie
in a mentoring program.

468
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:19,880
Sounds more like you
were mentoring her.

469
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,581
- She came onto me.
- And you jumped right in.

470
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,682
Till she dumped me.

471
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,917
Yeah. That's pretty rough.
I've been there, pal.

472
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,278
You're lonely, you go to her apartment
to get back with her.

473
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:31,690
She lets you in. You gotta have her.
But she ain't giving it up.

474
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,626
She turns her back on you.
You force her into the bedroom.

475
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,272
Good evening, Detectives.
This interview is over.

476
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:39,564
That's too bad 'cause we're
just getting to the good part...

477
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,200
where we ask your client to
consent to a blood test.

478
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,368
Can we have a moment?

479
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:54,307
Dr. Marks would like to clarify
what he's told you.

480
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,248
Keep my wife out of this.

481
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,752
We'll keep her out of it,
if you stop lying.

482
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,492
We met in a chat room.
hooked up at Flings.

483
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,428
And I wasn't lying when I said
she came on to me.

484
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,930
And you had an affair.

485
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,231
That's all we wanted.

486
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,633
Till it got out of control.

487
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,802
How?

488
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,105
We were having sex every day.

489
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,907
Sometimes two or three times.

490
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:28,546
Wherever we could.
Hotels, my office, clubs.

491
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:32,550
Till we burned out, broke up.

492
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,086
It's like we used each other up
and threw each other away.

493
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,956
What happened Sunday night?

494
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,294
My wife was at the gym
when Marnie called around 7:00.

495
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,530
She's out of her mind.
Tells me she needs me.

496
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,865
I get there.

497
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:51,236
Says some student found
her picture on the Internet.

498
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,771
That it could ruin her.

499
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,041
Did you have sex?

500
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,643
She needed it. So did I.

501
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,010
How long were you there?

502
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,050
Till 8:30. She was very much alive.

503
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,521
My client admits he was
there that night. But he didn't kill her.

504
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,540
You don't understand.

505
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:20,932
It's like being possessed.

506
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:25,303
Like some uncontrollable,
overwhelming urge...

507
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:30,642
and something grabs hold
of me and won't let go...

508
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:35,413
till I satisfy it with sex.

509
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:41,764
And then I'm okay,
till the next wave hits.

510
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,355
Where else did Marnie arrange
to meet her men?

511
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,525
When she had a date, she usually
took them to the Majestic on 7th Avenue.

512
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,594
She needed a quick fix,
she went to the club.

513
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,863
I thought she was banned
from Flings.

514
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,265
This other place.

515
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,902
I only went there with her once.

516
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,004
It's like walking into hell...

517
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:06,061
just as sleazy.
Dante's Inferno.

518
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,450
I didn't know Marnie liked it so rough.

519
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,321
Police! All right, everybody up.

520
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,289
All right, let's get our clothes on.

521
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,591
Let me see your hands!

522
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,060
That side of the wall,
please. Line up here.

523
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,962
We got enough room here. Right now.

524
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,029
Straight line.

525
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,017
Cover yourself, please.

526
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,838
We got a tame crowd here tonight.
All we got is an ounce of weed.

527
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,975
The TV news is outside.

528
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,078
Here's a pop quiz. My friends
are gonna show you a photo.

529
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,847
Her name is Marnie Owens,
though I suspect you people...

530
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,849
exchange fluids more
often than names.

531
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:51,389
Anybody who recognizes her, raise
the hand not holding up your clothes.

532
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,559
Anybody?

533
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,495
Apparently these upstanding people
don't understand the question.

534
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,898
All right. So here's what we're gonna do.

535
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,501
Whoever tells us what they know about
Marnie, we take you out the back door.

536
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,338
Everybody else, they get their 15 minutes
worth of fame in front of the cameras...

537
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,640
through the front door.

538
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,152
Let's try it again. Anyone?

539
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,252
There we go.

540
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:27,058
Well, let's see. Promoting prostitution.
Third offense. No plea bargain.

541
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,893
Sounds like seven years at Fishkill.

542
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,764
Nobody's getting hurt.

543
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,933
Start talking.

544
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,534
What's in it for me?

545
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,437
We'll tell the A.D.A. you cooperated.

546
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,773
She came in a couple of times a week.

547
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,208
When did you last see her?

548
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,843
Friday night.

549
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,913
She didn't come in Saturday.
Two guys actually left.

550
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,748
That gal was great for business.

551
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,916
How so?

552
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,052
She was as wild as they come.

553
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:58,122
She wouldn't do bi, but she'd do
three guys at one time.

554
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,891
Then three more and three more.

555
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,025
We get it.

556
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,760
She liked it rough, too.

557
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,462
You ever participate?

558
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,264
I'm an entrepreneur.

559
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,734
It wouldn't be professional for me
to get involved with the clients.

560
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:14,405
Anyone show up tonight who took
a special interest in Marnie?

561
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:18,776
One guy. Came in with the rest of us.

562
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,651
Ten down, five to go.

563
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,986
You see him?

564
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,783
Second from the end, in the chairs.

565
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:40,632
He's up next with Olivia and Elliot.
Fancied Miss Owens.

566
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,467
You, go with him.

567
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,902
Follow that detective.

568
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,871
He liked Marnie.

569
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,874
Isn't that special?

570
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,776
What's your name?

571
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,512
Am I charged with anything here?

572
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,181
How about adultery?

573
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,183
It's still on the books.

574
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,353
Your turn.

575
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,327
Phillip Montrose.

576
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,379
You know her?

577
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:14,132
That schoolteacher who was killed.
I read about it in the paper.

578
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:19,737
Okay. We can do this here or
we can do it at Rikers. It's up to you.

579
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,640
I saw her picture on a web site.

580
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,875
And?

581
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,511
She looked hot. I e-mailed her.

582
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,879
She answer you back?

583
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,447
She invited me to meet her.

584
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,549
Majestic Hotel on 7th Avenue.

585
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,551
What happened?

586
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,019
We go at it.

587
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:39,362
She tells me to meet her
the next night at Dante's.

588
00:32:39,362 --> 00:32:41,693
I thought it was a restaurant.

589
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,295
I asked her what they serve
and she laughs...

590
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:49,867
and tells me they have
the most extensive menu in town.

591
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:53,338
- What'd you order?
- She ordered for both of us.

592
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:57,041
Sex, with me and four other guys.

593
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,676
You go back there with her?

594
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,479
Lots of times.

595
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,882
You know, sounds like
you're attracted to her.

596
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:10,388
The place is like an amusement park.
She was my favorite ride.

597
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,956
A rough ride?

598
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:18,029
She liked it that way. So do I.

599
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,631
Where were you Sunday night at 10:00?

600
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,066
At my in-laws.

601
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:28,406
Trying to reconnect with my wife
and two kids. We're separated.

602
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:33,144
Byron Marks alibi checks out. Doorman
says he came home at 10:00 p.m.

603
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,879
Didn't leave until the next morning.

604
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,647
Not a killer, just a perv.

605
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,483
We're talking about victimless crime.

606
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,684
Unless you're Marnie Owens.

607
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,786
Marnie Owens problem wasn't
that she had group sex.

608
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,521
It was that she couldn't stop herself.

609
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,224
We got 14 others here from Dante's.
What's their excuse?

610
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,227
You mean the fireman, the accountant,
the director of human resources?

611
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,430
All consenting adults, behind
closed doors, nobody gets hurt?

612
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,698
They don't need an excuse.

613
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,502
That's easy for you to say, Mr. Letting-
itall-hang-out at-some-art-gallery.

614
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:01,472
All right. Last time I looked,
this was the Special Victims Unit...

615
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,207
not the sex police.

616
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,676
These are photos
from the memorial service.

617
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,945
Okay, Phillip Montrose was arrested...

618
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,082
for criminal trespass two months ago
in Connecticut.

619
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,384
Stamford police say that
he was booked for stalking.

620
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,619
D.A. Knocked it down.

621
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,923
Well, Montrose told us that he left Dante's
last Saturday because Marnie wasn't there.

622
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,659
But he did...

623
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,029
go to her memorial service.

624
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,198
I guess he wanted to pay his respects.

625
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,461
Or stalk her to the grave.

626
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,612
So I went to the service.
That's a crime?

627
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,615
You sorry that your favorite ride
was closed for good?

628
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:48,386
I told you, we had a good time.
I'm gonna miss her.

629
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,288
It's touching.

630
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,723
We heard you had a problem
in Connecticut.

631
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,392
Criminal trespass.

632
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,462
It was a misunderstanding. I haven't
been near that woman in months.

633
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,932
You know, most stalkers only give up
after they've found another target.

634
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,901
Marnie wasn't just
my favorite ride, okay.

635
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,371
She did every guy that walked
into that place.

636
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,208
We checked on your alibi
with your wife.

637
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,010
She says she hasn't seen you
or her child support in three weeks.

638
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,747
Yeah. Well, she'll say anything
to get back at me, now, won't she?

639
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,843
I got work to do.

640
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:27,024
You know, Ethan said that some guy,
outside of Marnie's apartment building...

641
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,227
told him she was murdered.

642
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,329
Think it could have been Montrose?

643
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,160
We know these guys sometimes like
to come back and admire their handiwork.

644
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,405
DOUGLAS MACARTHUR
HIGH SCHOOL
201 RIVINGTON STREET
TUESDAY, JANUARY 30

645
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,141
You ever seen this guy here?

646
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,177
Yeah, I booted him twice.
Last Friday, I think.

647
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,798
- He say why he was here?
- Claimed he needed to use the restroom.

648
00:35:49,798 --> 00:35:52,049
I told him to use the head
in the restaurant across the street.

649
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,217
And he came back?

650
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,887
Half an hour later, caught him
trying the door to the gym.

651
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,122
Threatened to call you guys
if he didn't split.

652
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,264
Never saw him again.

653
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,795
Marnie might still be alive
if she'd just called us.

654
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:08,933
She reports the stalking,
her secret gets out, career's over.

655
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,802
- She was afraid of being judged.
- She was right.

656
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:15,072
Hey. Did you guys find out
who killed Miss Owens yet?

657
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,008
We're still working on that.

658
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,544
Well, thanks to her,
I got a full scholarship.

659
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,046
- Temple University.
- Congratulations.

660
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:26,751
Check this out, huh?
You ever seen this guy?

661
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,221
Yeah, outside Miss Owens' building.
The morning y'all found her dead.

662
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,174
He's the one that told me
she was murdered.

663
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:41,799
How can I help you, Officers?

664
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,701
We got a warrant to search
your apartment.

665
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,002
We also have another warrant...

666
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:49,173
compelling you to a blood test
for DNA comparison.

667
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,209
I'll call my lawyer now.

668
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,444
Have him meet us down
at the medical examiner's office.

669
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,979
We'll be giving you a ride.

670
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,348
Check this out.

671
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,482
Family photos?

672
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,385
More like a stalker's scrapbook.

673
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,388
Telephoto lens.

674
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,629
You like taking pictures, Phillip?

675
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:12,230
RIKERS ISLAND
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 31

676
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,998
The scrapbook proves nothing.

677
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,499
It makes our case even stronger.

678
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,387
You'll never get an indictment.
This woman makes Casanova look celibate.

679
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:20,137
Which the grand jury will never hear.

680
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:23,007
What they will hear is that
your client's DNA was inside the victim.

681
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,108
As was another man's.

682
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,894
They will also hear from
the woman he previously stalked.

683
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:28,846
They will hear from witnesses
who can place your client...

684
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:31,549
at both her apartment and her school
the morning she was found.

685
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:35,987
And they will see your client's scrapbook
filled with memories of Marnie.

686
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,391
About 7:00 in the morning,

687
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,360
I got to Miss Owens' apartment building...

688
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,095
and the police were there.

689
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,063
What happened next?

690
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,599
I asked what was going on.

691
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,134
Did anybody answer you?

692
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,336
Yeah. Some guy in the crowd.

693
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,872
What exactly did he say?

694
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:58,276
He said some woman who lived
on the third floor was raped and strangled.

695
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,244
A teacher.

696
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:03,147
And did you later come
to know the identity of this man?

697
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,417
Yeah. Phillip Montrose.

698
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,552
Thank you, Ethan.

699
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,155
Ladies and gentlemen
of the grand jury...

700
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,591
Phillip Montrose revealed
a detail of the crime...

701
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:19,130
that could only have been known
at that time by the police and the killer.

702
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,292
I hope that you will consider...

703
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,786
Excuse me.

704
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,375
What's going on here?

705
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:35,079
My client wishes to exercise his right...
to make a statement to the grand jury.

706
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,281
- Too late.
- They haven't voted.

707
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,550
I know what you're trying to do
and it won't work.

708
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,814
Well, you got to play to win.
Let's see what a judge decides.

709
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,726
CHAMBERS OF
JUDGE LENA PETROVSKY
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 1

710
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:53,464
190.50 of the CPL states that notice
must be filed in a timely fashion.

711
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,632
Read the statute.

712
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,402
It says the defendant can appear as long
as the indictment has not been filed.

713
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,770
They haven't even voted yet.

714
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,540
You told me yesterday
your client declined to testify.

715
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,309
Well, he's changed his mind.
He has that right.

716
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,979
Your Honor, his entire strategy is
to blame the victim for her own murder.

717
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:13,217
He is going to poison the grand jury by
revealing Marnie Owens' sexual history.

718
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,819
It's all relevant.

719
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,756
Mr. Matthews, you are right
on the edge of a call from me...

720
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,257
to the Disciplinary Committee.

721
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,993
If you deny my client his rights
and he is indicted...

722
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,262
I will move for dismissal.

723
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,833
Of course you will.
And I'll have to grant the motion.

724
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,968
And you will have to re-present
the entire case.

725
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,036
Your honor, I think...

726
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,705
I don't like it any more
than you do.

727
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,142
But you can still get him
on cross-examination.

728
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:44,400
He's a sitting duck because
Mr. Matthews here can't object.

729
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:51,922
I met Marnie Owens through a personal
ad she placed on an Internet web site.

730
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:55,426
She was looking for a sex partner.

731
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,596
She invited me for
an hour-long quickie...

732
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,265
at a midtown hotel.

733
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:05,503
She then invited me to a sex club...

734
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,505
called Dante's Inferno.

735
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:14,378
That night, I was one of five men
who had intercourse with her.

736
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:19,116
We returned to the club
together numerous times.

737
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:25,222
On the night of her murder,
Marnie came to my apartment.

738
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,925
She was desperate. She said...

739
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:33,364
a student she brought home saw
the nude photo of her in the Internet ad.

740
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:38,335
She was worried that it would
ruin her teaching career.

741
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:43,040
She asked me to have sex...

742
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,142
and I agreed.

743
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:49,613
She was insatiable.

744
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:55,686
I did not kill her.

745
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,872
Thank you.

746
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:05,362
You had sex with Miss Owens
the night she was murdered.

747
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,131
Why did you lie to the police?

748
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,667
I'm in the middle of a bitter divorce.

749
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:14,004
It's ammunition for my wife
if this comes out.

750
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,341
Didn't you keep a scrapbook of photos
you had taken of Miss Owens...

751
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,676
without her knowledge?

752
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,079
Marnie saw those photos.
They excited her.

753
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,317
Didn't you tell police she was
"your favorite ride"?

754
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,221
Nobody forced Marnie to do anything
at Dante's she didn't want to do.

755
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:34,653
Just answer the question.
Did you say that?

756
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,728
Yes.

757
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,931
Didn't you also go to her apartment
the morning after she was murdered?

758
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,066
I was worried about her.

759
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,801
Where you told a young bystander...

760
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,302
she had been strangled and raped?

761
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,072
How do you think I
found out about it?

762
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,041
Somebody there told me.
I didn't know the details.

763
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,477
You followed her to school,
you followed her home.

764
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,347
You were jealous,
angry, weren't you? / I wasn't.

765
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,382
Because she was having sex
with other men.

766
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,751
You think I was jealous of that slut?

767
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,455
You have to care about someone
to be jealous. She was a whore.

768
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,757
Stick to the facts relevant to the case,
Mr. Montrose.

769
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,492
Those are the facts.

770
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:12,363
She'd spread her legs for anybody,
anywhere, any time.

771
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,931
As many as she could.

772
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:17,101
She'd pick up guys off the streets
and bring them home.

773
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,189
She liked it rough!
She was asking for this to happen.

774
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:24,241
God only knows who Marnie picked up
on her way home from my place...

775
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:27,645
- because she needed another fix.
- She needed a fix?

776
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,648
You stalked a woman in Connecticut,
then you stalked Marnie Owens.

777
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:36,845
Now she's dead.
What about your fix, Mr. Montrose?

778
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,233
What happened?

779
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,585
Montrose and his lawyer put
Marnie's sex life on trial.

780
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,375
Law isn't always about justice.

781
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,845
Who let you in on our dirty
little secret?

782
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:05,819
All the Marnies who came before.

783
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,486
That bastard's gonna beat this.

784
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,056
Don't second-guess yourself, Alex.

785
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,224
From where I'm sitting,
you did everything right.

786
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:18,503
And I would be the first one
to tell you if you didn't.

787
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,799
Thank you.

788
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,512
We have an indictment?

789
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,548
Yes.

790
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,149
Good work, Alex.

791
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,684
What?

792
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:44,088
They didn't go for murder two.
It's manslaughter one.

793
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,090
Grand jury couldn't get past her sex life.

794
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,292
The son of a bitch is gonna
get away with murder.

795
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,361
No. They listened.

796
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,831
They think Montrose is guilty,
a jury will, too. / Not life.

797
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:57,134
Fifteen to 25 to sit around
and think about what he's done?

798
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:00,474
I'll take that.

799
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:13,425
