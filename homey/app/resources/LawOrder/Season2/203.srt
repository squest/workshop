1
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,181
In the criminal
justice system...

2
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,816
sexually-based offenses

3
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,485
are considered
especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,226
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives...

5
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,197
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

6
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,790
are members of an elite squad

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,392
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

8
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,136
These are their stories.

9
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,235
911 emergency operator 307.
What is your emergency?

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,302
I'm in the Lincoln Tunnel.
I haven't moved in 45 minutes.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,813
You reporting
an accident, sir?

12
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,817
It's almost midnight. What
the hell's up with the traffic?

13
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,248
911 emergency operator 307.
What is your emergency?

14
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,813
There's a rape. Right now.
88 West Franklin.

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,052
Now, get down!

16
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,457
Get away from me!

17
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,825
I said get...
Hello?

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,924
Two-seven-Charlie,
respond to a 10-34.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,594
Assault in progress
at 88 West Franklin.

20
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,900
No suspect description. Line
disconnected. Respond Code 3.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,965
What've you got? 911 didn't
get an apartment number.

22
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,340
Probably a cell phone call.
We're knocking on doors.

23
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,039
Perp may still be in there?
Yeah, if there is a perp.

24
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,479
Wouldn't be
the first prank call.

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,176
You guys from Special Victims? Yeah.

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,047
Found this under
the fire escape.

27
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,748
"Lori. "
Got her. 3-B.

28
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,852
Special Victims. Benson,
Stabler. How you doing?

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,490
I heard some crying. The door's
unlocked. She's in the shower.

30
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,933
I started to go in, but she started
freaking out on me, so I backed off.

31
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:43,991
Thanks.

32
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,004
Stay away!
Lori?

33
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,330
Gina?

34
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,041
It's Olivia.

35
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,537
It's filthy in here. That's
okay. I'm going to help you.

36
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,546
Lori?

37
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,990
Please don't come in here.
This place is filthy.

38
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,627
Lori?

39
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,340
Hey, how long you been
in the shower?

40
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,181
This drain...

41
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,616
I want this stuff out
of here. What stuff?

42
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,210
The stuff he washed off me.
I want it out of here.

43
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,917
Lori, the stuff is long gone.
You've already washed it all away.

44
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,490
It's okay.

45
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,525
It's okay.

46
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,032
It's okay.

47
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,106
Give me your hand.

48
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,170
There you go.

49
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,681
This is really happening,
isn't it?

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,476
Come on.

51
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,853
"Is this how you like it?

52
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,621
"Is this how you like it?"
That's all he kept saying to me.

53
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,685
The man who made you dirty?
Yeah.

54
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,259
There you go. Got her?

55
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,703
Stay with me.
Back in one second, okay?

56
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,038
He washed her. Asked her,
"Is this how you like it?"

57
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,373
His favorite neighborhood, his
type, blonde, petite, single.

58
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,174
Bastard's at it again.

59
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,476
Why am I not surprised?

60
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,993
It's him.

61
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,366
It has to be him.
Not so fast.

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,102
It's been a year since we had
Cleary in here as a suspect.

63
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,576
Same M.O. Probably came in
off the fire escape.

64
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,581
He rapes them, asks them if
they like it, he bathes them...

65
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,243
and then he steals a piece
of jewelry as a memento.

66
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,512
It's him. Kenneth Cleary.

67
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,214
We had him and we lost him.

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,280
We couldn't keep him.
Not our fault.

69
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,757
You want to tell
the victim that?

70
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:54,815
Hey.

71
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,220
We're going to go in here.

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,360
Lori, did you open the window? Yes.

73
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,966
The night, it was cool. I like
to sleep under heavy blankets.

74
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,673
He pulled my blanket off me.

75
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,869
My shirt was over my eyes.

76
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,976
A button got caught
in my mouth.

77
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,615
He hit me.

78
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,148
Then what happened?
He tried to kiss her.

79
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,214
He tried to kiss me.

80
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,792
He yanked that button
out of my mouth...

81
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,197
and kissed my neck.

82
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,227
His lips were dry.

83
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,163
My necklace, he ripped off.

84
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,533
He was inside me.

85
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,037
He pushed hard.

86
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:47,902
It hurt.

87
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,049
But he kept saying...
"Is this how you like it?"

88
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,410
"Is this how you like it?"

89
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,814
He...

90
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,551
finished.

91
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,687
Then he brought me
into the bathroom.

92
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,195
He made me take a shower.

93
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,099
My shirt got wet, heavy.

94
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,529
Did you see his face?

95
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,807
My shirt was over my eyes.

96
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,840
He told me not to look.

97
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,273
None of his victims
could ID him.

98
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,376
Nothing from Forensics. There
never is with Kenneth Cleary.

99
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,647
When he heard the sirens,
he pushed me back and...

100
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,760
I hit my head on the tiles.
Heard the sirens?

101
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,289
Did you call the police?

102
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,722
No.

103
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,230
We got a witness.
You move slow.

104
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,467
We go after Cleary off this,
he'll be out the door again.

105
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,102
But not too slow.
Move slow as fast as you can.

106
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:00,084
There's a rape. Right now.
88 West Franklin.

107
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,142
Now, get down!

108
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,244
Get away from me!

109
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,413
I said get...

110
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,854
So maybe two witnesses.

111
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,121
Three, if you count the dog.
Where'd the call come from?

112
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,089
Pay phone on Franklin.
You call back?

113
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,632
Pay phone blocks
incoming calls.

114
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,469
Lori Thatcher's apartment
is on the third floor.

115
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,843
You can't see into her
apartment from here, though.

116
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,472
So who can?

117
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,285
Two apartments
could see to the rape.

118
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,746
Look at that.

119
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,388
Who is it?

120
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,455
Mrs. Walton, New York Police.
Detectives Benson and Stabler.

121
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,426
Can I see your badge, please?

122
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,438
What's wrong?

123
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,040
We're investigating an assault
in the building across the way.

124
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,017
Last night.
I heard the sirens.

125
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,884
No one's home next door.
No, they're on vacation.

126
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,220
How long have they been gone? A week.

127
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,225
They're very nice.
They give Hank...

128
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,761
his last walk of the night
for me when they're here.

129
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,057
I hate it when they're gone.

130
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,861
Your apartment looks into the
apartment where the assault took place.

131
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,232
I'm blind, Detective.
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,741
But was anybody here
with you last night? No.

133
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,676
Billy was here, but just long
enough to take Hank out for me.

134
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,144
And what time was that?

135
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,272
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
The news was on.

136
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,182
Which news?
The 24 hour news.

137
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,710
Okay. And Billy is?

138
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:46,456
Billy Smith. The young man
down in 1-G. He's a doctor.

139
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,184
Thank you very much.

140
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,095
You know, if he's not in his
apartment, you might try the roof.

141
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,392
I thought
I could hide up here.

142
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,596
Mrs. Walton gave you
up there, Dr. Smith.

143
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,865
I'm not a doctor yet.

144
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,340
Did you walk Mrs. Walton's
dog last night? Yeah, Hank.

145
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,003
What time?
11:00.

146
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,103
Could it have been
closer to 12:00?

147
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,011
Could have been 3:00 a. m.
for all I know.

148
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,711
I got sleep deprivation,
light deprivation, time.

149
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,378
If I don't pass this exam...

150
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,979
When you walked Hank, did he
bark or lunge at a woman...

151
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,457
using the pay phone that's
right down in front there?

152
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,925
He's a guide dog.

153
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,359
He's trained not to.

154
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,357
Why don't you try the news
stand at the end of the block?

155
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,990
Ginger, quiet!

156
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,092
Down.

157
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,062
Sorry about that.

158
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,437
He can't be good
for business.

159
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,033
No, but he's great for theft.
Yeah, I bet.

160
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,099
Last night...

161
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,272
did he attack a woman at the phone
booth at the end of the street?

162
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,576
He never touched her.

163
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,550
I had him on the leash. She's
got no business calling the cops.

164
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,110
Actually, sir, we're
investigating another matter.

165
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,349
Think you could describe her?

166
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,951
Blonde.

167
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:57,686
Age? Thirty, maybe.
Thin, but not too thin.

168
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,195
Could you describe her
to a police sketch artist?

169
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,665
I didn't get a look
at her face.

170
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,362
I was too busy trying to
get Ginger into the car.

171
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,234
You remember
what she was wearing?

172
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,831
Yeah. A black sweater,
and black slacks...

173
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,404
and thong panties.

174
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:15,106
You didn't get a look at her face but
you know she was wearing thong panties?

175
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,580
I saw the panty line.

176
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,551
She had a nice ass, which is more
interesting to me than her face.

177
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,324
I'm an ass man,
I don't apologize for it.

178
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:30,351
So we have the dog, but not the
witness. Maybe the dog can ID Cleary.

179
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,726
We don't know
that it's Cleary.

180
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,196
Like hell we don't.

181
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,789
We can't make him for it yet.

182
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,427
You have to stay open to the
possibility it's someone else.

183
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,994
Come on, Captain.
The M.O. matches.

184
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,271
The victims
are identical types.

185
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,536
Their injuries
are virtually identical.

186
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,271
At least he's not
getting rougher.

187
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,710
How is Miss Thatcher?

188
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,375
She coming out of shock, going
into numb. Staying at her parents.

189
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,011
911 call terminated
at 12:03:39 a. m.

190
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,352
And at 12:04 another call was
made from the same pay phone.

191
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,581
To?

192
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,254
A Gramercy Park brownstone owned
by Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Cleary.

193
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,762
Let's go.
Hold on.

194
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,799
Cleary's raping Lori
at the same time...

195
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,562
somebody's downstairs
calling his house?

196
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,624
I'm on it.

197
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,831
Cleary sees you and Stabler again
you're done before you start.

198
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,236
Mrs. Cleary?
Yes.

199
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,801
Detectives Munch and Tutuola.

200
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,110
Did you receive a call
around midnight last night?

201
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,547
It's about time.

202
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,547
I've been after the phone
company for the past two months...

203
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,054
to do something
about these calls.

204
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,886
You've had other calls?
Some woman's harassing me.

205
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,022
What does this woman say?

206
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,027
"Your husband's a rapist. "

207
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,654
Last night, she said, "He's
raping someone right now. "

208
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,792
Last night there was a rape
in the building...

209
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,927
by the pay phone
that call was made from.

210
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,302
Was your husband home
last night?

211
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,939
My husband's not a rapist.

212
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,272
Was your husband home
last night?

213
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,671
Yes.

214
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,005
He didn't walk the dog?

215
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,810
We all walk the dog.

216
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,508
Your phone rings, someone tells
you your husband's raping someone.

217
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,111
Then what?
I went back to sleep.

218
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,452
You didn't call the phone
company? I went back to sleep.

219
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,924
You didn't tell your husband?

220
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,224
We don't both have to be awake
for a harassing phone call.

221
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,265
But he was here?
Yes.

222
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,232
I called the phone company
this morning.

223
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,531
Did they offer to put a
trap on your line? Yes.

224
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,400
But my husband
doesn't want that.

225
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,565
They could listen
to our personal conversations.

226
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,165
And he's involved with
private financial matters.

227
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,846
This woman is ruining our
lives. Why don't you stop her?

228
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,947
Check Cleary's phone records?
What we're doing.

229
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,576
Mrs. Cleary alibi
her husband?

230
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,484
Yeah, but she was
choking on it.

231
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,414
Okay, Mrs. Cleary notified the phone
company after each harassing call.

232
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,790
They all track to pay phones.

233
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,989
She said she ignored the first
call thinking it was a prank, right?

234
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,259
That's what she said.
Just went back a month.

235
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,301
Found a number
in our case file.

236
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,571
That first call came from
one of Cleary's victims...

237
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,636
Harper Anderson.

238
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,803
Looks like she's stalking
him. Sorry, Olivia.

239
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,713
You should be
at his place, not mine.

240
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,346
Harper, you can't
stalk Cleary.

241
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,684
Stalking is illegal.

242
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,517
I survey from
a legal distance.

243
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,824
Playing with semantics here
can be very dangerous.

244
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,705
I saw him go into the alley.

245
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,372
By the time I got to it,
he was gone.

246
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,905
And I saw the fire escape.

247
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,945
Did you see him
on the fire escape?

248
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:34,945
No.

249
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,278
But it's how he got
into my place to rape me.

250
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,844
But you didn't see him go up it.
You didn't see him rape anyone.

251
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,615
No.
And yet you called 911.

252
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,622
First I circled the building
to make sure...

253
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,658
that there was no way
I could've missed him.

254
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,785
Then I thought about the probability
that he was raping someone.

255
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,523
Then I called 911.

256
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,556
Why didn't you stick around?

257
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,694
Because he ran out the service
entry right after the sirens.

258
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,641
I considered waiting for you
guys, but I've been down that road.

259
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,177
So I shadowed him.
Shadowed him?

260
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,711
Not to be confused
with stalked.

261
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:16,745
And this is art not to be confused
with obsession or a target?

262
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,192
It goes with the room.

263
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,286
Have some wine.
We're working.

264
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,389
6:00 p. m. Work day's done.

265
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,797
You can have a glass of wine.
No, thank you.

266
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,895
He's a workaholic.

267
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,465
He won't leave the office
till 8:00.

268
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,076
We can chat
for another hour and a half.

269
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,748
You couldn't identify him
in a lineup.

270
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,183
How do you know
he's the man that raped you?

271
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,417
I was at his sentencing for
possession of stolen property.

272
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,453
When he left the court...

273
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,660
he winked at me.

274
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,123
Winked.

275
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,991
So who did he rape
this time?

276
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,598
He raped someone. Otherwise
you wouldn't be here.

277
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:16,175
Maybe a Scotch. Vodka?
No, thank you.

278
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,416
You don't have
to be so tense.

279
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,577
I don't expect anything
from you.

280
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,621
We did everything
that we could.

281
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,020
You couldn't ID him,
so we couldn't hold him.

282
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,557
You could have followed him.

283
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,819
You knew he would rape again.

284
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,192
I'd like to follow every guy that I
know that has a propensity to rape.

285
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,561
Poor police. So overworked!

286
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,260
Harper, you're not equipped
to deal with this.

287
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,735
I'm equipped.
I don't approach him.

288
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,538
I'm doing what any private
investigator would do...

289
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,871
and I don't need a license
to do it for myself.

290
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,411
You're harassing his wife.
Give me a break!

291
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,605
She's enabling a rapist.

292
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:52,281
And you're too busy
to deal with him, so I will.

293
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,989
Harper Anderson is dangerous. I'm
not certain that she's dangerous.

294
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,086
She's stalking Cleary.

295
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,893
He raped her. She's following
him to catch him at it.

296
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,292
We almost got him on the Lori
Thatcher rape because of her.

297
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,031
You buy into her distinguishing
between stalking and following?

298
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,437
The system failed her...

299
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,408
so she's operating it herself
as best she can.

300
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,411
I mean, Cleary doesn't know
that she's there.

301
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,743
She doesn't approach him,
she doesn't threaten him.

302
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,806
Mrs. Cleary feels threatened.

303
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,319
Sooner or later she has to face the
fact that her husband's a rapist.

304
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,947
Why? She doesn't have to
face it unless we prove it.

305
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,457
And we don't want her pushed
there by Harper Anderson.

306
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,755
Street justice
is always bloody.

307
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,830
Munch, Fin, bring Harper in
here for a blunt talking-to.

308
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,957
Captain... No, you're too close to her.

309
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,292
You and Elliott
get in the Clearys' faces.

310
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,362
Let them know we're onto them.
It may not go to making a case...

311
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,374
but I want to diffuse this
tinderbox before it blows.

312
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,778
Elliott, look!

313
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,615
Those are mine!

314
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,950
You stop it right now!

315
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,753
Get out!
You can't do this!

316
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,292
Get out!
You can't do this!

317
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,261
My son will see these! He'll
know where he comes from.

318
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,491
You bitch! You're
sleeping with a rapist.

319
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,260
Mrs. Cleary...
Get out of my neighborhood!

320
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,097
You're enabling a rapist.
Harper, stop it!

321
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,137
Mrs. Cleary, listen to me.
Calm down.

322
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,364
Take a breath, okay?

323
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,371
What's going on?

324
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,601
She's putting these
everywhere. Look.

325
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,699
Detective Stabler.
Yeah.

326
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,338
Two nights ago, a woman was
raped. I was home with my wife.

327
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,848
You're lying. I saw you.

328
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,817
Every time a woman is raped
you're going to come to me?

329
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,251
Not every time, no.

330
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,288
How long do I have
to bear the brunt...

331
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,290
of this woman forgetting
to take her lithium?

332
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,121
She's obviously damaged.

333
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,255
Hey! Drop it.

334
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,561
Don't make me cuff you.
Perfect! Arrest me!

335
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,898
Not the rapist.

336
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,618
We have anything else on
Lori Thatcher's rape?

337
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,952
She could do a voice ID.

338
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,585
But Cleary ain't coming down
here to see us on his own.

339
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,888
We need probable cause.

340
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,795
Harper can place Cleary exiting
Lori Thatcher's building.

341
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,263
Her building,
not her apartment.

342
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,825
After that stunt Harper pulled with
Cleary's car, she's zero as a witness.

343
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,428
And there's still the problem
of Harper stalking Cleary.

344
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,667
Harper's taking control
of her own life.

345
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,100
Please.

346
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,667
As long as Cleary's out there,
so's his next victim.

347
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,111
He'll stay out there
until we can make a case.

348
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,747
We need to pick up
where Harper left off.

349
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,682
I'm all for that.

350
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,812
I can't authorize overtime
to follow Cleary.

351
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,893
Anyone asking for it?

352
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,789
Are you with us? He's likely
to call in lawyers.

353
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,299
If you don't interfere with
his conducting his life...

354
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,597
I'll field any motion he files. Bingo.

355
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,709
So you take care of
that part of it. Okay.

356
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,144
Don't forget.
What are you doing here?

357
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,413
We're going to go
see your boss.

358
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,578
Got a problem with that?
No.

359
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,150
Around the corner
on the left.

360
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,157
We're investigating
a serial rapist.

361
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,630
What can you tell us
about Kenneth Cleary?

362
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,061
What's he have to do
with that?

363
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,763
Is he a good employee?

364
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,465
Is he involved in a rape?

365
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,201
What's he like to work with?

366
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,235
He's a workaholic.
One of our top earners.

367
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,312
So he works late?

368
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,315
He's here when I arrive
and he is here when I leave.

369
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,616
We lost two assistants who couldn't
keep up with him in Philadelphia.

370
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,349
We're opening a branch there.

371
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,756
He go there a lot?
Spends half his time there.

372
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,892
You think he raped someone?

373
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,123
He has
a misdemeanor conviction...

374
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,031
for possession
of stolen property.

375
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,296
He spend the night in Philly?

376
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,199
Yes. We have
a corporate apartment.

377
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,440
Could we see
his travel records?

378
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,450
Had to tell the boss I was convicted
on possession of stolen property?

379
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,014
Public record, pal. You're
trying to get me canned?

380
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,788
I brought the company in
$58 million last quarter.

381
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,886
He'll live with
a misdemeanor conviction.

382
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,192
And a rapist?

383
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,593
Let me ask you something,
one hungry man to another.

384
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,401
Is there anything better than
gorging on a fresh caught meal?

385
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,973
You won't be
eating out anymore.

386
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,052
Going back six months.

387
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,055
Three rapes in Philadelphia
have Cleary's signature.

388
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,454
June 13.

389
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,359
He was there.
The 10th to the 20th.

390
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,494
August 26?

391
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,193
There, the 23rd to the 28th.

392
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,701
September 15.
There.

393
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,662
They got him booked on Amtrak
to go there tomorrow.

394
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,799
Who booked to go where?
Cleary to Philadelphia.

395
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,932
Then you're going too, John.

396
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,638
What a coincidence. Why?

397
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,510
You found rapes that
match Cleary's M.O.? Three.

398
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,050
You're interviewing
the victims face to face.

399
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,219
Something wrong
with the facts?

400
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,911
Philadelphia's SVU is under review
for dumping rapes as unfounded.

401
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,390
So, yes, there's absolutely
something wrong with the facts.

402
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,926
I don't trust them.

403
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,955
There he is.

404
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,394
Hey, Ken Cleary.
A little jumpy this morning?

405
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,228
Love to talk, Det. Munch,
but I've got a train to catch.

406
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,063
Yeah, Philadelphia club car.

407
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,567
We're going coach.

408
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,765
But if you feel the need to talk
to me, I'm willing to upgrade.

409
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,831
What's the agenda here,
gentlemen?

410
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,104
You trying to make me crazy?
Hell, no.

411
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,907
Way too late for that.

412
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:32,310
And you are? The knot in
the pit of your stomach.

413
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,417
Hate to disappoint you. But I don't
mind the company or the attention.

414
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,581
So there's no need to ask.
Is this how you like it?

415
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,899
What have we got? A list
and description of jewelry...

416
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,500
stolen during rapes,
matching the Cleary M.O.

417
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,045
Three here,
three in Philadelphia.

418
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,172
Munch just faxed these
from the Philly P.D.

419
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,408
For what purpose?

420
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,849
Show Mrs. Cleary. See if
she has any of these pieces.

421
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,409
If she's an accessory,
she'll deny it.

422
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,918
What are the odds that
she's an accessory to rape?

423
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,686
I agree, they're remote. The
odds are that she's in denial.

424
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,387
Who wouldn't be?
But it's still risky.

425
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,395
What about the issue
of spousal privilege?

426
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,193
I'm not going to ask her anything
about her husband's rapes.

427
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,893
I'm going to show her
that list.

428
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,493
If she's unwittingly in
possession of stolen property...

429
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,630
it might turn up the heat at
home. We've pressed him at work.

430
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,638
We've run out of plays
to make here.

431
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,768
So, what, a Hail Mary?
Okay.

432
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,938
She's going to be defensive.
I'm sensitive to that.

433
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,349
And you are?

434
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,578
Taking some
quasi-personal time.

435
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,319
I called Harper last night because I
felt like I dropped the ball with her...

436
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,914
so I'm going to meet her
for coffee.

437
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,586
Where? Westside Range.
I'll see you later.

438
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:53,761
You're meeting her at firing
range? I know. She's permitted.

439
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,593
Detectives Munch and Tutuola
are from New York City.

440
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,935
They may have a lead
on the man who raped you.

441
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,635
I know it's difficult but if
you can tell your story again.

442
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,345
I woke up choking on a pillow.

443
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,915
He told me to keep
my eyes closed...

444
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,814
and then he took the pillow
out of the case...

445
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,379
and held the pillow case
over my eyes.

446
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,858
He held my T-shirt
over my eyes.

447
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,426
He pulled my nightshirt over
my face so I couldn't see him.

448
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,397
He asked,
"Is this how you like it?"

449
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,498
"Is this how you like it?"

450
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,961
"Is this how you like it?"

451
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,001
After he raped me,
he made me shower.

452
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,177
My hot water was broken.

453
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,969
He washed me.

454
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,340
He had me in a cold shower...

455
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,885
washing his semen off me.

456
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:55,355
I asked him if his mother knew
what he was doing.

457
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,960
He said his mother
just wanted him to be happy.

458
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,935
Mrs. Cleary, Detective Stabler.
I don't want to talk to you.

459
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,808
Mrs. Cleary...

460
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,475
rape victims aren't just
the women who are attacked.

461
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,039
Rape victims include
their families...

462
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,317
and the rapist's families.
I am not a victim.

463
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,288
And I don't want you
standing on my stoop...

464
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,086
shouting "rape"
through my door.

465
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,216
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:32,286
You're harassing me. Destroying
my family. When does this stop?

467
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,729
Right now.

468
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,295
This is a list of jewelry and
the dates they were taken...

469
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,064
during rapes
we suspect your husband in.

470
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,402
My husband makes money. He doesn't
need to steal to give me jewelry.

471
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,771
I'm talking about
a sickness here, Mrs. Cleary.

472
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,846
Serial rapists
very often take items...

473
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,973
so that they can look at them
and remember.

474
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,643
Your trophies,
like your jewelry...

475
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,378
allow your husband
to relive the rapes...

476
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,179
so that he can
become excited.

477
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,384
I am sorry to put you
through this.

478
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,360
I know this is
a terrible ordeal for you...

479
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,192
but it is worse
for the victims.

480
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,359
And quite frankly, I don't
know where else to turn.

481
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,600
I won't bother you again.

482
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,956
Nice grouping.
What are you using?

483
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:43,427
.50 caliber, double action
Desert Eagle. 14-shot clip.

484
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,265
Took me a month to learn
how to hold it level.

485
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,173
This sucker's nearly 40 ounces
with a full load.

486
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,243
Harper, a 14-round clip
is illegal in New York.

487
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,403
Here.

488
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,844
Didn't know that.

489
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,678
Eight is plenty.

490
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,317
That gun's pretty extreme.

491
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,146
Why?

492
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,713
A.50 caliber semi-auto
with a 14-round clip?

493
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,224
It's practically
an assault rifle.

494
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,885
I just gave you the clip.

495
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,320
You're something else.

496
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,358
What? You think I'm Velma Vigilante...

497
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,664
stalking Cleary, waiting for
the perfect moment to shoot him?

498
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:21,929
That's not who I am.

499
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,305
You're not the same person
I knew six months ago.

500
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,968
I was a rape victim
when you met me.

501
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,740
I finally have control
over my life back.

502
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,249
I'm not interested in revenge.

503
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,017
I'm not even interested
in justice anymore.

504
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,818
Then why follow Cleary?

505
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:43,259
Because I'm afraid of him, and
he's the last thing I'm afraid of.

506
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,923
If I can get over that I will
have my life back completely.

507
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,866
You want to go for a drink?

508
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,002
There's a little Spanish place
around the corner.

509
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,070
Tapas and Sangria?

510
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,443
I would have bet the new old
Harper to be a Whiskey Park girl.

511
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,681
I haven't cruised a chichi
date bar since I was raped.

512
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:14,254
I was just writing you a note. Really?

513
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,555
I'm sorry for what
happened to you.

514
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,159
You didn't do it, Mrs. Cleary.

515
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,364
But you said
I was enabling a rapist.

516
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,362
I shouldn't have.
He's my husband.

517
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,339
I feel responsible for...

518
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:37,079
I feel guilty.
I want you to know that.

519
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,213
What made you
change your mind?

520
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,297
My husband has always
surprised me with his...

521
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,697
no-special-occasion gifts.

522
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,669
A silver ring
next to my coffee cup.

523
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,639
That opal ring on my pillow.

524
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,479
He'd get so excited
when I tried them on.

525
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,210
I thought it was romantic.

526
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,247
Six of the pieces match.
The rest?

527
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,923
He gave them to me the
same way. don't want them.

528
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,755
Did your husband ever discuss with
you how he came by the jewelry?

529
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,096
Don't answer that.
Spousal privilege.

530
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,726
Excuse me for a moment.

531
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,203
Do you want some privacy?
No.

532
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,206
I'll just take a second.

533
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,676
I can't take it. Come home.

534
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,378
No, you have to come home now.

535
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,522
He'll be on the next train
from Philadelphia.

536
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,169
I can't tolerate
any more of this.

537
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,001
You follow me to work, you
follow me to Philadelphia. Fine.

538
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,906
But you make my wife hysterical
and that, my friends, will cost you.

539
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,103
I'm gonna call my lawyer
and the Police Commissioner.

540
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,306
You might want to stick with
just your lawyer for now.

541
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,906
Kenneth Cleary,
you're under arrest.

542
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,507
You have the right
to remain silent.

543
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,713
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

544
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,255
You have the right
to an attorney.

545
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,883
If you cannot afford an
attorney one will be appointed...

546
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,302
Are you ready?
Yes.

547
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,406
Can I close my eyes?
Yes.

548
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,708
Would you have them each say, "Is
this how you like it?", please.

549
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,341
Is this how you like it?

550
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,516
Is this how you like it?

551
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,289
Is this how you like it?

552
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,350
Is this how you like it?

553
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,722
It's him.

554
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,090
It's him.

555
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,865
Very entertaining.

556
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,535
How many more shows
are there today?

557
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,339
Is this how you like it?

558
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,412
Is this how you like it?

559
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,852
Is this how you like it?

560
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,386
Is this how you like it?

561
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,854
Bastard.

562
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,424
That's him.

563
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,490
That's him. It's Number 4.

564
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,760
We have one more.

565
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:43,062
I don't have to be here. I'm
sure your report will be accurate.

566
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,893
See you in court.

567
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,739
"File number 492276.

568
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,711
"People verses Kenneth Cleary.

569
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,805
"One count rape
in the first degree...

570
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,350
"one count sexual abuse
in the first degree...

571
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,886
"one count robbery
in the second degree...

572
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,614
"and three counts
criminal possession

573
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,748
"of stolen property
in the fifth. "

574
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,457
Quite a list.

575
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,518
How do you plead?
Not guilty.

576
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,064
Exactly how much we planning
to charge the defendant...

577
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,565
to get out of jail, Ms. Cabot?

578
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,964
Remand without bail,
Your Honor.

579
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,662
Put away your claws,
Counselor.

580
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,203
My client is not
a flight risk.

581
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,795
He's a pillar
of the community.

582
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,898
If you define pillar
as a seven-figure salary.

583
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,000
And if he can afford you,
he can afford to fly.

584
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,807
Mr. Cleary is willing to
surrender his passport, Your Honor.

585
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,370
Your Honor,
he is a menace to women.

586
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,643
His crimes are not confined
to the State of New York.

587
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,209
The People have had my client under
surveillance even across state lines.

588
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,188
Their continued harassment
should assuage their fears.

589
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,817
Is that true, Ms. Cabot?
No.

590
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,892
SVU detectives went to Philadelphia
to interview Mr. Cleary's victims.

591
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,989
Objection.
Be quiet.

592
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,992
I still need a number.

593
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,000
$500,000.

594
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,401
Let's double that.
No objection.

595
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,845
Is that the best
you could do?

596
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,581
You shouldn't be here, Mrs.
Cleary. You're my witness.

597
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,016
I thought maybe there
was a chance I was wrong.

598
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,349
I saw how he looked at you, and I knew.

599
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,049
We should get together soon so
I can prep you before the trial.

600
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,251
I'm staying with my family
in Long Island.

601
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,385
Is there anything
I can do for you now?

602
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,123
You know
a good divorce lawyer?

603
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,227
I don't know
if she can do this.

604
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,025
A moment, Ms. Cabot.

605
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,939
I'm Harper Anderson,
Mr. Klein.

606
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,036
Your client raped me.

607
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,002
I know how famous you are.
Yes?

608
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,610
You're going to
burn in hell.

609
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,284
I'm Jewish, Miss Anderson.
There is no hell.

610
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,878
Excuse us.

611
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,851
Save me the bedtime reading.
How many motions are you filing?

612
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:52,794
Omnibus. In limine, to
suppress, and spousal privilege.

613
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,623
See you in judge's chambers.
Yeah.

614
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,970
Spousal privilege
is inviolate.

615
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,237
Discovery was made
through the wife.

616
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:10,743
Give me a good reason
not to throw out the jewelry.

617
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,578
It doesn't fall
under privilege.

618
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,380
Nobody asked Cleary's wife
where he got the jewelry.

619
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,114
Would anyone care for lemon?

620
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:22,116
Communication between a husband
and wife is not limited to speech.

621
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,819
The police went
to the Cleary home...

622
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,194
with the express purpose
of discovery.

623
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,633
They should have handed
the list to Mr. Cleary.

624
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,135
He would have
turned over the items.

625
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,435
He gets his gifts from various
sources, which he would have revealed.

626
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,407
But in an effort
to disrupt his family...

627
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:42,742
the police went to his wife to induce
her to violate spousal privilege.

628
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,380
The court can't support that.
The jewelry has to be excluded.

629
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,681
The police did not ask
Mrs. Cleary any questions...

630
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,277
regarding
her husband's activities.

631
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,481
They presented her
with the list of stolen items.

632
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,048
She discovered she had several
pieces of jewelry on that list.

633
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,150
And she turned them in.

634
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,024
Please, Ms. Cabot.

635
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,598
Don't you consider him giving
her jewelry an activity?

636
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,926
Limit the scope to receipt
of the jewelry and by whom.

637
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,730
But Your Honor, it's...
Next item.

638
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,135
Voice ID.

639
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,072
This is a stretch under
the best of circumstances.

640
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,972
But a terrified victim...

641
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,377
hearing the breathless voice
of an aroused perpetrator...

642
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,472
during the commission
of a violent act?

643
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,608
I don't think so.

644
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:25,382
You'll have your chance to undermine
the identification during cross.

645
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,152
More tea?

646
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,227
That's how I knew it was him.

647
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,930
Thank you.

648
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,568
You identified the man who
raped you, is that correct?

649
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,942
Yes. Kenneth Cleary.

650
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:50,511
But you didn't actually
see him, did you? No.

651
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,311
You identified him by
voice, is that correct? Yes.

652
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,445
I'd know
that voice anywhere.

653
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,057
Is this how you like it?

654
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,617
Do you recognize this voice,
Ms. Thatcher?

655
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,561
No.

656
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:11,097
I can play it again.
Objection. Asked and answered.

657
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,262
Hearing this surprised
the witness, Your Honor.

658
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,362
Maybe she'd like to hear it
again to make sure.

659
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,770
Go ahead.

660
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,708
Is this how you like it?

661
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,005
Do you recognize the voice?

662
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,582
Does it sound vaguely
familiar? Objection.

663
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,584
He's badgering.
Sustained.

664
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,085
Yes, Your Honor.

665
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,485
The man on the tape
is a co-worker.

666
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,581
You talk to him every day.

667
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:36,484
Robert.

668
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,086
You don't recognize his voice,
how can you recognize...

669
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,255
Objection!

670
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,526
Sustained.
Back off, Mr. Shoenfeld.

671
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,408
How did you come into possession
of this garnet necklace?

672
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,041
It was a gift from my husband.

673
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,177
He gave it to me...
Wait for the next question.

674
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,722
Your answers need to be
very narrow and very specific.

675
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:10,193
Why are you only asking about how I
came into possession of the jewelry?

676
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,328
I can't ask about
anything else.

677
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,421
Why not?

678
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,525
Communication between husband
and wife is inadmissible.

679
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,261
It's as privileged
as priest and supplicant.

680
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,866
You aren't going to ask me about
how excited he got when I wore them?

681
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:30,072
How he insisted I wear them
before we had sex?

682
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,273
I can't.

683
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,645
I wish I could but I'm not
allowed to ask about that.

684
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,215
Do you understand?

685
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,279
The jewelry is important,
Mrs. Cleary.

686
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,723
Because we need to connect
the timeline to the rapes...

687
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,760
so that your husband
won't be able to duck...

688
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,591
by claiming that
he purchased swag...

689
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,358
from some guy
on Canal Street.

690
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,959
He wants joint custody of our
son. And he's not going to get it.

691
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,565
If he gets off...
One thing at a time, okay?

692
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,402
Okay.

693
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,544
How did you come into possession
of this garnet necklace?

694
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,605
My husband gave it to me.

695
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,819
Was it a special occasion?
No.

696
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,979
Do you remember
when he gave it to you?

697
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,719
Kenneth gave it to me
on his return...

698
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,692
from a business trip
to Philadelphia.

699
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,729
September 6.
Objection.

700
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,560
The witness couldn't possibly remember
the dates of every gift she received.

701
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,998
Mrs. Cleary, how is it
that you recall this date?

702
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,505
It was our son's
first day of kindergarten.

703
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,838
Kenneth made sure
he was home for that.

704
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,311
He left the necklace
on my pillow the night before.

705
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,907
Overruled.

706
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,016
Did you know this necklace
belongs to a woman who was raped...

707
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,780
on September 5
in Philadelphia?

708
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,981
Objection. Relevance.
Sustained.

709
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,554
You're on thin ice Ms. Cabot.

710
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,617
Stick to the scope.

711
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,623
Mrs. Cleary,
do you recognize this ring?

712
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,063
I do.

713
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,002
And do you remember how you
came into possession of it?

714
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,534
My husband gave it to me.

715
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,980
Do you remember when?
Yes.

716
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,016
I remember because we were
dressing for a charity event.

717
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,287
He asked me to try it on...

718
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:22,859
and then he got so excited,
he had to have sex with me.

719
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,292
Objection.
He'd get so excited...

720
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,386
Mrs. Cleary, stop.

721
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,590
...if I wouldn't have sex
with him he'd masturbate.

722
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,189
Objection.
Mrs. Cleary...

723
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,995
You had me wear
your trophies...

724
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,731
so that you could get off?
You sick, twisted bastard!

725
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,466
I move for
an immediate mistrial.

726
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,440
The witness
is clearly hysterical...

727
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,808
and has done irreparable
harm to the jury. Granted.

728
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,378
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

729
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,511
you are excused.

730
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,284
I'm sorry.

731
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,255
Approach.

732
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,148
I'm so sorry.

733
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:03,726
I hold you responsible,
Ms. Cabot.

734
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,061
You knew the limits
set before you.

735
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,365
You prepped your witness.

736
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,139
You knew she was in a
severe and emotional state...

737
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:18,045
and you now have
the pleasure of starting over.

738
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,314
In the interim...

739
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:25,353
I sincerely hope you acquire
some professionalism.

740
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,397
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

741
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,285
You're not having any?

742
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,722
AA.

743
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,091
How are you holding up?

744
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,856
I felt like I was 10 years
old today getting yelled at...

745
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,957
for playing
in my mother's make-up.

746
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,697
We can't do this again.
Why?

747
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,469
We've got no case.

748
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,237
The dream team blew holes
in the victim's IDs.

749
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,611
And Mrs. Cleary... I think
she sabotaged us on purpose.

750
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,278
What would she hope to gain
by doing that?

751
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,751
I don't know.

752
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,946
Kenneth Cleary walks, and
the People get a black eye.

753
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,392
So it's all about you?

754
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,562
I don't need this, Cragen.
No?

755
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,564
While you're whining
about your case

756
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,395
seems you forgot
about Harper Anderson...

757
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,128
Lori Thatcher,
the women in Philly.

758
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,171
Don't forget Mrs. Cleary.
The biggest victim of all.

759
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,707
You think she suffered more
than her husband's victims?

760
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:55,108
She has to deal with him the
rest of her life. She has his son.

761
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:56,905
What?

762
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,412
We're on our way.

763
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,249
I just came by to get
a few things for my son.

764
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,925
He hit me. Kept hitting me.

765
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,827
She didn't have a choice.
He wouldn't stop.

766
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,797
Who tried to clean up?
I did.

767
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,707
Meredith was hysterical. She didn't
want the blood to seep into the floor.

768
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,937
Does it make a difference?

769
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,440
You know it does, Harper.

770
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,883
Bleach ruins
the gunshot residue test.

771
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,514
Really?

772
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,912
Who shot him?

773
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,687
Who shot him?
I did.
