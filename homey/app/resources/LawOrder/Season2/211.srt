2
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:25,355
In the criminal justice system,

3
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:28,885
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:30,226
In New York City,

5
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:33,429
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

6
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:36,662
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,747
These are their stories.

8
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:54,454
We spent $2 million on this video.
They better give it heavy rotation.

9
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,624
- Any word on Ricki's new album?
- Heavily pop.

10
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,026
Hear they're holding it back
for the London concert.

11
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,063
Jared's still on tour,
but Ricki's on her way here.

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,765
You know recording sessions,
always running late.

13
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,901
- Where's the birthday boy?
- Corbin?

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,906
- My assistant forgot to pick up a card.
- He's probably...

15
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,292
I think I know where he is.

16
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:19,646
Hey, Ashley,
have you seen your brother? / No.

17
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,115
Sarah, where's Corbin?

18
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,585
I saw him heading off to the bathroom,
five minutes ago.

19
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,887
What the hell is he doing here?

20
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,824
- No!
- Oh, no.

21
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,237
- Corbin, are you all right?
- Let me go.

22
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,332
Stop!

23
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,001
Wait! Come back!

24
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,767
Corbin!

25
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,313
Honey.

26
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,911
Talk to the mother yet?

27
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,080
Her people will let us know
when she's ready.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,927
That's her, in the leather.

29
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,022
- I want him arrested.
- There'll be a full investigation.

30
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:06,597
He molested my son.

31

Law & Order SVU
2x11. Abuse

41
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:55,914
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/01/26

42
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,183
How many active investigations
are you two running?

43
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,052
Twelve open rapes,
17 child abuse.

44
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:11,257
I just got a call from the boys upstairs.
Make room for a VIP case. / Who?

45
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:15,261
Ricki Austin believes her son's molester
was responsible for his death.

46
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,564
Paper doesn't mention anything
about a sex angle...

47
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,832
but it talks about straight vehicular.

48
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,168
It goes on at great length
to say that Ricki was...

49
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,604
female vocalist of the year,
two years running.

50
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,508
The boy was chasing the man
who had molested him in a restroom.

51
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,144
- Stranger or acquaintance?
- Former teacher.

52
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,345
Someone he trusted.

53
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,215
They tried for years to have kids
before they adopted Corbin...

54
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,983
and the second they did...

55
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:40,787
Ricki got pregnant,
they have a little girl named Ashley.

56
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,088
Hey, I read People.

57
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,291
She was that girl singing at county fairs
who snagged Jared Black...

58
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,394
of Black Plague,
rock 'n' roll's bad boy.

59
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,096
Rolling Stone.

60
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,232
So when do we roll out
the red carpet?

61
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,456
One Police Plaza says you
are to go to them.

62
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:59,105
HOME OF RICKI AUSTIN
AND JARED BLACK
40 BEEKMAN PLACE
MONDAY, JANUARY 15

63
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,074
David Russo...

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,244
he was Corbin's computer teacher.

65
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,213
We hired him to tutor privately.

66
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,582
Here you go, honey.

67
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,252
Did you witness them
coming out of the bathroom?

68
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,487
Corbin came out crying.

69
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,190
- Were they alone in there?
- Yes.

70
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,828
Corbin's dead because of him.
I want him charged with murder.

71
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,497
We can't promise you anything,
but trust me...

72
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,200
no one serves harder time
in prison than child molesters.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,103
I did everything I could to keep
him away from Corbin.

74
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,839
- He had a restraining order.
- What had he done?

75
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,476
He was inappropriately affectionate.
Constantly touching him.

76
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,511
Did you talk to Corbin about it?

77
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,813
We fired Russo,
we thought that was the end of it.

78
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:45,251
But when I came back from tour,
he was here in this house with Corbin.

79
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,154
And that's when we took out
the restraining order.

80
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,991
Was anyone present
during the tutoring sessions?

81
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,794
The nanny, Sarah.

82
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,763
Were you with them at all times?

83
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,631
I have Ashley, too.

84
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,999
I came in and out.

85
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,869
And when they were together
what did you see?

86
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,272
He hugged him, all the time.

87
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,907
Anything beyond that?

88
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,375
Kisses.

89
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,812
On the forehead, the cheek.

90
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,516
And just the way he looked at Corbin.
It wasn't teacherly.

91
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,251
When Mr. Russo dropped by...

92
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,420
did Corbin seem upset
or throw a temper tantrum?

93
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,623
Hi...

94
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,958
Ashley, right?

95
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,509
What are we hiding from?

96
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,435
So, what do you do
when you're not hiding under there?

97
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:39,138
- School and lessons.
- Yeah, what kind of lessons?

98
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,307
Tap, piano, ballet, and singing.

99
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:47,246
- Wow. You're a lucky little girl.
- Yeah.

100
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,881
Did you ever take computer lessons?

101
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,285
I was gonna start,
but the tutor stopped coming.

102
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,987
Did you know Mr. Russo?

103
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,795
Yeah, but we weren't friends
like him and Corbin.

104
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,695
Hey, what happened there?

105
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,564
- That's an accident.
- What kind of accident?

106
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,308
Ashley, did somebody hurt you?

107
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,196
That was an accident, too.

108
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,882
You ready?

109
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,086
Okay, well, I gotta go.
Maybe we can talk again sometime.

110
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:31,958
I'll look for you here or under the sofa,
how about that?

111
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,895
- I forgot your name.
- It's Det. Benson...

112
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,724
but you can call me Olivia.

113
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,518
I'll see you later.

114
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,272
Nanny said Russo was here four,
sometimes five days a week.

115
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,407
Dedicated.

116
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,809
Yeah, especially considering
he was only paid for two.

117
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,977
How'd you do?

118
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,479
Ashley claims that she didn't have
much contact with Russo...

119
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,749
But her wrist was hurt
and she had bruises on her thigh.

120
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,741
I think it's about time
we talk to this tutor. / Yeah.

121
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,567
APARTMENT OF
DAVID RUSSO
511 E. 93RD STREET
MONDAY, JANUARY 15

122
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,496
If you're looking for David,
you missed him.

123
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,192
- You know where he was going?
- No.

124
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,170
- He was crying.
- Really? Any idea why?

125
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,105
No, do you?

126
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,040
How well do you know Mr. Russo?

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,944
I know enough to know
he was around more lately.

128
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,014
During school hours.

129
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,883
I think he got fired.

130
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,853
Does he have a lot of company?
A girlfriend maybe?

131
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,389
= All I ever see are kids.
- In his apartment?

132
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,293
Coming in and out of here
all the time.

133
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,261
I say we stick a uni outside
his apartment...

134
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,063
and pick him up the second
he gets home.

135
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,566
Based on what?
Kids going into their tutor's apartment...

136
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,202
his hugging Corbin?
'Cause at this point, that's all we've got.

137
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,305
When he snuck into that party,
he violated the order of protection.

138
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,840
We've got criminal contempt charge.

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,708
It's a misdemeanor,
he'll be out in two hours.

140
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,971
- We can do better than that.
- He's seeing kids in that apartment alone.

141
00:07:57,971 --> 00:08:01,881
We need more ammunition
before we bring him in.

142
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,049
And he was fired.

143
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,191
Let's find out why the school
didn't want him teaching kids anymore.

144
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,554
THE CRESTBORNE CSHOOL
626 E.83RD STREET
MONDAY, JANUARY 15

145
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,456
David was great with the students.

146
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,124
We were sorry we had to let him go.

147
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,893
- Why did you?
- Cutbacks.

148
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,128
Looks like you're operating
on a shoestring budget.

149
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:20,266
What's tuition here...
about $10,000 a kid?  / $17,000.

150
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,236
You fired Russo a week
after Ricki Austin let him go.

151
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,006
Bad for business, if parents catch wind
you have a pedophile on staff.

152
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,774
I don't believe we did.

153
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,511
Teaching meant everything to David.
When he came here...

154
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,279
he said our system was obsolete...

155
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,548
and personally donated
a dozen new computers.

156
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,085
- On a teacher's salary?
- This was his first teaching assignment.

157
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,120
Where was he before this?

158
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,525
Vanross Piller Investments.
He was their computer whiz kid.

159
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,828
When your trading system takes
a dump on a volatile stock day...

160
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,765
- you pray for a Russo.
- So he had a pretty important position?

161
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,002
- VP in MIS.
- You mind decoding that?

162
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:00,172
Management Information Systems.
He designed all the company's software...

163
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,775
and he was just as knowledgeable
about hardware.

164
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,778
- A double threat.
- Must have been sad to see him go.

165
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:10,249
Sad is when the Dow swings 500 points.
I was devastated.

166
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,051
But he wanted to work with kids.

167
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,420
Just out of curiosity,
what does an MIS VP make?

168
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,043
Starts at a $150,000.

169
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,161
Masks are on the counter.

170
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:26,499
- Did you finish with the celebrity's kid?
- He's in the fridge.

171
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,902
The parents' "people" have been raising
holy hell to have him released.

172
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,671
Any signs of sexual abuse?

173
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,473
No fluids, no tearing,
no restraint marks, no bruising.

174
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,476
Yeah, fondling wouldn't leave
any marks.

175
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,928
Actually, take a look for yourself.

176
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,792
- This seem odd to you?
- He bit his nails.

177
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:57,496
Down to the nub.
See this rash on his wrist?

178
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,766
Stress-related eczema.

179
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,136
Plus, his back teeth are ground down.

180
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,895
What was this kid so anxious about?

181
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,110
So, where are we?

182
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,546
Single white male, late 20s,
highly educated.

183
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,649
- Gotta be around kids.
- And a computer whiz.

184
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,518
Somebody with a hankering
for Internet kiddie porn?

185
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,253
That's why we're pulling
Russo's LUDs.

186
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,055
If we get his service provider...

187
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,924
we can find out if he's been
hitting the sites.

188
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:30,997
Maybe downloading, which would
nail him. / All right. Get on it.

189
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,199
How was Corbin's relationship
with his father?

190
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,335
My guess is minimal. Jared's been
on tour longer than the Stones.

191
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,403
Kid's always with nannies.

192
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,538
Leaving him wanting for
a male authority figure.

193
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,806
Like a teacher.

194
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,708
Speaking of which,
we pulled Russo's LUDs.

195
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,844
Don't tell me he wasn't up
to something on that computer.

196
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,945
It's cyber evidence.

197
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,114
That doesn't prove
that he molested Corbin.

198
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,816
We don't have Forensics yet,
we have no eyewitness...

199
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,052
and we don't have a living victim
to make a statement.

200
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,253
That we know of.

201
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,024
What do you say
we talk to the kids he tutors?

202
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,594
He's way cool.
Everybody wanted Russo.

203
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:06,832
- Yeah? You got a computer at home?
- Doesn't everybody?

204
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,334
I guess they do.

205
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,038
So, why would you go over
to his place to take lessons?

206
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,606
He has the ultimate system.

207
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,475
So, you know, you're over there,
did he ever get...

208
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,545
you know, get physical with you?
Ever wrestle around with you?

209
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,248
Mr. Russo? No.

210
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,650
He ever hug you? / No.

211
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,385
Okay, when's the last time
you saw him?

212
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,887
Last week, at soccer practice.

213
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,255
Yeah, what was he doing?

214
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:34,360
Just watching. And then he stayed
after to talk to Corbin.

215
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:41,137
Seth, that's it, man,
I got no more questions for you.

216
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:48,245
- He violated his restraining order twice.
- Let's get a warrant.

217
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,782
Somebody's skipping town.

218
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,123
Two seconds ahead
of the search warrant.

219
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,159
Pedophile on the run.

220
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,656
Look at this.

221
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,537
It's a shrine.

222
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,475
He must have been
following his every move.

223
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,243
What are you doing here?

224
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,146
Teaching you the meaning
of a restraining order.

225
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:31,826
David Russo,
you're under arrest.

226
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,626
What are you doing with these?

227
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,963
Some of these are two years old...
before you even started teaching.

228
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,966
Before you even met Corbin.

229
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,903
He was an accessory.

230
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,940
Like their diamonds or Grammys.

231
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,446
A trophy kid to pull out
for photo-ops.

232
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,614
Mr. Russo...

233
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:06,852
you got that job at Crestborne so you
could be near him, didn't you? /Yes.

234
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:11,090
And a tutoring position so
you could be alone with him?

235
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,992
They were horrible parents.

236
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,227
And I told them so.
Why do you think I got fired?

237
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:19,113
- Mr. Russo, we know why you were fired.
- What'd you do with Corbin?

238
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:27,540
I listened to him,
I encouraged him.

239
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,928
You loved him.

240
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,761
Why'd you bring him
in the bathroom? /  What?

241
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,886
No...

242
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,289
- you can't be thinking...
- You were obsessed with him...

243
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,091
You don't understand.
They wouldn't let me near him.

244
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,327
- You stalked him.
- No, I was leaving town.

245
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,162
You were his teacher,
you gained his trust.

246
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,861
You knew about his birthday.
You found out where his party was.

247
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,070
You molested him. / No!

248
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,439
Your whole world revolves
around this little boy.

249
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,776
Now, why is that?
Explain that to me.

250
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,793
Because he's my son.

251
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,156
The tutor tells you
he's your daddy.

252
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,724
That's gotta mess
with a kid's head.

253
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,460
Russo says he never told him,
out of just that concern.

254
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,628
A considerate psycho.

255
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,330
He got a girl pregnant at 17...

256
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,765
put the baby up for adoption,
signed away all his rights.

257
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,667
Ten years later,
it's still nagging at him.

258
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,669
So Mr. Computer starts
searching the Net.

259
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,873
Where he gets a hit on a famous couple
with an adopted boy...

260
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,507
fixates on it being his.

261
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,376
The guy's not budging off his story.

262
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,278
Then lets give him a little push.

263
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,047
Get on the adoption agency,
and put a rush on the DNA.

264
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,351
Still, we don't have a living CW,
an eyewitness or forensics.

265
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,987
- No confession, no case...
- No excuses.

266
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,990
I've got media sniffing around
and the brass chomping at my ass.

267
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,567
I want this closed yesterday.

268
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,764
SVU, Detective Benson.

269
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:03,969
Ashley, are you okay?

270
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,438
We'll be right there.

271
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,376
NEW YORK
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
579 FIRST AVENUE
TUESDAY, JANUARY 16

272
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,846
- Hi, there.
- Olivia.

273
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:19,385
- Hi. What happened?
- I fell.

274
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:23,422
- Where?
- My stairs at home.

275
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,059
- Who was with you?
- Nobody.

276
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,570
Feel.

277
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,114
That's a goose egg, all right.

278
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,270
Ashley...

279
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,006
you would let me know
if there was anything that I could do...

280
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,676
to stop these accidents, wouldn't you?

281
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,806
You can't help accidents.

282
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,649
No parents?

283
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,185
Jared's probably on a plane
back from Europe.

284
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,522
- And Ricki?
- Recording studio.

285
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,891
She's back working already?

286
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,593
People have different ways
of dealing with grief.

287
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:07,066
Yeah, well, her kid's in the hospital.
Why the hell isn't she here?

288
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,835
I can't.

289
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,472
Everyone who works for them
signs a confidentiality agreement.

290
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,442
I could lose my job and be sued.

291
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,678
Fair enough.
Where were you when Ashley fell?

292
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:24,249
Packing up Corbin's room.
I didn't want to drag Ashley through that.

293
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,752
How long have you worked
for them?  / A year.

294
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:32,624
And in that time,
how many accidents has Ashley had?

295
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,427
She's had accidents all her life.

296
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,162
You don't know
how many I've prevented...

297
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,933
Sarah.
Shouldn't you be with Ashley?

298
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,902
Yeah.

299
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,739
- What are you doing here?
- Ashley called us.

300
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,475
We thought we'd come down
and check in on her.

301
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,111
I'm sorry she bothered you.

302
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,586
I won't let it happen again.

303
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,421
Sarah.

304
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,158
- Please, I really can't talk to you.
- What's going on with Ashley?

305
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:10,662
You know, a criminal investigation...
supersedes a confidentiality agreement.

306
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,390
Now, if somebody's hurting
this little girl...

307
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,500
No, you misunderstood
what I said.

308
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,552
- I don't think we did.
- Who are you covering for?

309
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:20,339
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Is it Ricki? Is it Connie?

310
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,998
Just tell us who it is.

311
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,647
Called three times.

312
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,582
- Who? Maureen?
- Not yours, yours.

313
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,786
What? Who, Ashley?
What happened? Is she okay?

314
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:39,024
No, she saw the new NSYNC video
and was sadly disappointed, as was I.

315
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,793
She just called to chat.

316
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,595
- It's not funny, Munch.
- Yeah, well try this.

317
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,899
The adoption agency
and the DNA results confirm it.

318
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,835
David Russo is Corbin's biological father.

319
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,538
- Let's close this puppy out.
- We can't.

320
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,174
Why?  / Someone might be
abusing the sister.

321
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,911
- Don't do this to me. Who?
- We don't know.

322
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,579
- Who made the complaint?
- No one.

323
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,116
But this kid has got
a long history of accidents.

324
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,618
- And?
- She says they're accidents.

325
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:11,123
We can't just fabricate child abuse cases.
Especially with high profiles.

326
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,837
Captain, the nanny was this close
to giving something up to us.

327
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:16,795
Just let us have
one more shot at her.

328
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,231
The case is closed.
Leave them alone.

329
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,601
Captain, we need to inform
Ricki about Russo.

330
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,896
Do it by phone.

331
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,845
Okay, we're in, we're out.
We're not even supposed to be here, right?

332
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,415
- Olivia!
- Hey.

333
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,784
Ashley, you're in the middle of a lesson.

334
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,887
This is one of my best friends
and I hardly ever get to see her.

335
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,255
You've got 10 minutes left.

336
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,657
Actually, Ashley, I need to talk
to your mom, anyway.

337
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:49,394
So I'll come say goodbye
before I leave, okay?

338
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,463
Come on.

339
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,700
- Are you her piano teacher?
- No, I'm her new nanny.

340
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,970
- What happened to Sarah?
- I'll take care of this.

341
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,207
- What's your fascination with our nannies?
- Just how many you go through.

342
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,744
We thought we'd just drop by
to let you know Russo's been cleared.

343
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:09,815
What? / In fact,
he's Corbin's birth father.

344
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,851
- That can't be.
- DNA tests confirmed it.

345
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,220
It was a closed adoption.

346
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,123
He must have broken
some law to find him. / No.

347
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,693
- Was he planning to extort money?
- No.

348
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,697
He just wanted to make sure
that his son was loved.

349
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:30,402
Don't be naive. Wait and see
how quickly he sells his story.

350
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,371
Ricki didn't even register relief...

351
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,573
when she found out that
Corbin hadn't been molested.

352
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,208
We did drop a bombshell on her.

353
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,278
- Excuse me,
- they took her away.

354
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:44,516
Who?  / Immigration.
Immigration took her away.

355
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,652
Okay, are you talking about Sarah?

356
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,554
She got deported?
Is that what you're saying?

357
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:53,158
- I'm worried about the little girl.
- Okay, why?

358
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,360
- Why?
- No, I have to go now.

359
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,699
But, miss, please,
you need to talk to us. / No, I can't.

360
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:06,572
What the hell is going on
in that house?

361
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,341
You had no business going
back to that house.

362
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,677
- We were in the neighborhood.
- I dragged him there.

363
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,646
You have no grounds
for an investigation.

364
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,250
- Captain, they're covering something up.
- They're celebrities...

365
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,085
people pick through their garbage...

366
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,889
tape their cell phone conversations...
sell their intimate secrets.

367
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,458
Covering up is second nature
to these people.

368
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,162
Elliot. / Boss, read the ME's report
on the boy. Just talk to her.

369
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,097
That kid was a nervous wreck
about something.

370
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,833
It's hot in the limelight and this boy
never asked to be there.

371
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,370
Doesn't explain away Ashley's injuries,
or the fact that the one person who...

372
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,673
- decides to talk about them gets deported.
- And we need to interview her.

373
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,709
She's in England.
What do you want? Air fare?

374
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,978
- We'll take $4 for the tunnel.
- We already checked.

375
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:50,277
She's still at the INS detention center
in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

376
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,126
I begged you to leave me alone.

377
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,328
We're sorry.

378
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,537
The agent gave me
15 minutes to pack.

379
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,040
Ashley was still at school...

380
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,742
I didn't get to say goodbye.

381
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,245
Sarah, there's nothing more
that they can do to you...

382
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,415
but Ashley is still in that house.

383
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,183
Please, tell us who's hurting her.

384
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,753
I only wish it were that simple.

385
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,722
Her own mother doesn't have
time for her.

386
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,692
The longer she's away,
the more hyper Ashley gets.

387
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:38,196
I called Children's Services once,
anonymously.

388
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,400
They do drugs.
Not just Jared. Ricki, too.

389
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,803
- You saw Ricki doing drugs?
- No.

390
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,705
But I've seen her looking stoned.

391
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,807
What about that incident
you reported?

392
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,343
Ricki's accident.

393
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,946
She fell asleep at the wheel
and hit a post.

394
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,349
One of the rare times
she had the kids with her.

395
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:01,153
- Was anyone hurt?
- The kids weren't, thank God.

396
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,356
They were whisked away
before the police arrived.

397
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,825
Ricki went to the hospital.

398
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,727
What happened with
Children's Services?

399
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,830
Ricki had it all tidied up
before they even started looking.

400
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,398
Yeah, but there has
to be a police report.

401
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,634
There has to be hospital records.

402
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:20,395
Power and money can make
anything go away.

403
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,480
I understand you were the attending...

404
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,248
the night of Ricki Austin's car accident.

405
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,352
- It was nothing. Checked and released.
- Any complications?

406
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,021
Yeah, I had to get through
the hospital's VIP liaison...

407
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,490
and three of her handlers
before I could examine her.

408
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,659
I'm wearing a lab coat.
Who'd they think I was?

409
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,461
Obviously a reporter in disguise.

410
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,196
The story never made the papers.

411
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,231
Celebrities have to use pseudonyms...

412
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,367
or the hospital would be
overrun with fans.

413
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,602
What name does Ricki usually use?

414
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,671
Sorry, it's doctor-patient privilege.

415
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,140
- So, what were the extent of her injuries?
- Off the record.

416
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,542
Minor. Head laceration
and a bloody nose.

417
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,178
Way we heard it,
she was babbling incoherently.

418
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,115
- She was shaken up from the accident.
- Minor as it was.

419
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,650
You do a tox screen? / No.

420
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,886
You come in with those
exact symptoms at Bellevue...

421
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,522
it's automatic.

422
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,592
If you'll excuse me,
I have rounds.

423
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,695
Different treatment for the rich
and the poor. What's new?

424
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:20,098
Same hospital they brought Ashley.
Be nice to look at her medical history.

425
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,634
It's never gonna happen
without a subpoena.

426
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,469
Ashley acts out.

427
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,073
I'm very fond of her,
but she's very disruptive in class.

428
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,575
- Class clown disruptive?
- She talks through class...

429
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,944
and gets upset when other students
won't talk back.

430
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,346
She's starved for attention.

431
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,915
Positive or negative,
it doesn't matter.

432
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,151
She starts fights with
the slightest provocation.

433
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,486
Does Ashley have
a lot of accidents at school?

434
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,756
She's fallen off bleachers,
playground equipment.

435
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,526
- She's always showing off.
- "Look at me" accidents.

436
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,760
So what have you done about her?

437
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,097
When she disrupts class,
I send her to the steps.

438
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,601
- You make her run steps?
- No, out here.

439
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,236
When a student gets in trouble...

440
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,239
they're sent to step one,
for a 10 minute time-out.

441
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,975
Second offense, step two.

442
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,478
Ashley's a repeat step three offender.

443
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,015
I think she needs help,
not punishment. / So do I.

444
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,484
I sent letters home,
they were never answered.

445
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,152
I finally took it to the headmaster.

446
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,987
We've met him.
What did Parsons do?

447
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,791
He told her parents Ashley
had to see a therapist or be expelled.

448
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,061
- Is therapy helping?
- She's not getting therapy.

449
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,664
It didn't sit well with her parents.

450
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:29,568
But, hey, they did donate
a new library.

451
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,037
Where does that leave Ashley?

452
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,840
Out on the steps.

453
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,610
Anyone gets close to helping her,
Ricki buys a wall...to block them off.

454
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,364
And I think we've definitely hit ours.

455
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:42,647
There's gotta be something
that we can do.

456
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,584
What? They don't abuse her,
they don't criminally neglect her.

457
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,452
- They don't love her.
- What?

458
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,921
How many unloved kids
you think there are in this city?

459
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,689
It's not an SVU case anymore.
You just gotta let it go.

460
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:01,032
Yeah, right. Hold on.

461
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,679
I got the 2-7 on three.
They've got Ashley.

462
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,803
Why? What happened?

463
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:08,006
She just walked in to the desk sergeant,
then asked for you.

464
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,576
- Okay, put her through.
- Remember our little talk yesterday?

465
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,145
She's reaching out to me,
what am I supposed to do?

466
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,539
Have a uni drive her home.

467
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,051
This is Benson.

468
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,255
Hey, can somebody watch her?
We'll be there in about 10 minutes.

469
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,678
Okay.

470
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,275
Don't look at me.

471
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,974
- Olivia.
- Hey.

472
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,710
They left you in here all
by yourself?

473
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,414
Officer Garvey came in for a minute,
but she had to go.

474
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:53,318
- She wasn't that much fun anyway.
- Ashley...

475
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,755
did something happen?
Are you okay?

476
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,746
Yeah, I just wanted to see you.

477
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,962
Didn't you have school today?

478
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:08,166
- I ditched, then I took a cab here.
- Ashley.

479
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,068
They must have called
your mother by now...

480
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,470
I'm sure she's worried
sick about you.

481
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,738
She doesn't care.

482
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,542
She's probably going out of her mind.
I'm taking you home, let's go.

483
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:21,446
- No, I wanted us to hang out today.
- We can't, I'm working.

484
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:25,517
But I won't get in your way,
I promise. I can help you.

485
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,319
Ashley, you know how
you can help me...

486
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,955
you can help me by never
ever doing this again.

487
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,090
Do you understand that?
Now let's go, come on.

488
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,679
- No.
- Ashley.

489
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:41,678
- Ashley, you're bleeding.
- I'm okay.

490
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,238
Is your mother home?

491
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,304
She never is.

492
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,050
Come on, okay?

493
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:02,120
HI-FREQUENCY STUDIOS
599 W. 53RD STREET
THURSDAY, JANUARY 18

494
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,892
¢Ü But I wish I loved you then ¢Ü

495
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:15,836
¢Ü The way I love you now ¢Ü

496
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:20,002
Ashley Austin Black,
you get in here.

497
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,132
Why do you do this to me?
Let me see it.

498
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:29,347
Miss Austin, is there a place
we could speak privately?

499
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,309
Detective, you really shouldn't
have gone out of your way.

500
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,803
My driver would have picked her up.

501
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:35,387
Olivia doesn't mind.
She's my friend.

502
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,223
- It's important that we speak.
- This is not a good day.

503
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,059
Ricki, we've only got
the studio till 4:30.

504
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,927
We still have two tracks
to lay down.

505
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,764
Honey, look, why don't you
just go in the green room...

506
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,534
with Connie and you have her get
you something to eat, okay?

507
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:53,004
- But can't I stay with you?
- No honey, mommy's working.

508
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,474
- Then can Olivia stay with me?
- No, she can't.

509
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,790
Now just go, okay?

510
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,948
Thank you, Detective.

511
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,799
Okay, let's try it again.

512
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,823
She calls all the time.

513
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,025
What happens when
you have to hang up?

514
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,461
At first she begs to talk,
just for a few more minutes...

515
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,564
and then when I have to go,
she just...

516
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,132
She sounds so depressed.

517
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,568
When you first met, how much
time did you spend together?

518
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:27,839
Just a few minutes. / It sounds
like reactive attachment disorder.

519
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,574
It is very common in orphans...

520
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,377
who are abandoned during
their crucial bonding cycle.

521
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,347
They meet complete strangers
and they form instant relationships.

522
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,717
So it's not just my sparkling wit?

523
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,220
I have one patient who meets a stranger
and she goes up and hugs them.

524
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,755
She goes to the market...

525
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,558
and tells the checkout girl
that she loves her.

526
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,927
That fits.

527
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,895
But Ashley keeps getting hurt.

528
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,532
It's part of the package.
And it could escalate.

529
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,601
Is there treatment?

530
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,970
I could start her
on corrective attachment therapy...

531
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,840
but, Olivia, I'd have to see the mother
and daughter together.

532
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,909
It's never gonna happen.

533
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:11,416
If she's in imminent risk, Children's
Services could mandate therapy.

534
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,717
I'm sorry.

535
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,153
Come on, there's gotta be
something that you can do?

536
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,755
For emotional abuse? / No.

537
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,190
Ricki was reported before
for the car accident.

538
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,725
You did nothing about that, either.

539
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,294
You're busting my shoes over this?

540
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,831
I'm handling 32 families.

541
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,568
I've got babies with skull fractures,
10-year-old prostitutes.

542
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,304
I understand that,
I handle the same cases.

543
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,227
But that shouldn't mean that this little
girl has to fall through the cracks.

544
00:29:36,227 --> 00:29:38,910
Look, it's not that I don't care.

545
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,812
But with a high-publicity mom
like that...

546
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,882
I could spend weeks just trying
to get an appointment.

547
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,250
Okay, so do it.

548
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,419
I've got a kid in the burn ward
about to die.

549
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,054
It's triage.

550
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,590
You tell me who should get
my attention the most...

551
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,320
your one girl or my battered 30.

552
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,068
Please ask Ricki to call me
when she gets in.

553
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,540
Thank you.

554
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:13,378
- Olivia!
- Hey, kiddo.

555
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,947
- I can't believe you came.
- How you doing?

556
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,449
- You have to come see my room.
- Next time, sweetheart.

557
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,685
- No, please, just for a minute?
- No, I gotta go.

558
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,720
Ashley, she can't come in.
Let's go. / No.

559
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,323
No, really, sweetheart.
I gotta go, next time. / No.

560
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,126
- Ashley, come inside.
- No, not without Olivia.

561
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,128
- Make her come in.
- She can't.

562
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,537
Ashley. / No.

563
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:36,070
Ashley!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

564
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,706
- Give her to me.
- Let go of me.

565
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,576
- Give her to me. Get her inside.
- It's okay.

566
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,312
- No!
- What's the matter?

567
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,915
- What are you doing here?
- Your daughter needs help.

568
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:54,152
- I talked to a psychologist who...
- You did what?

569
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,521
This psychologist can help her.

570
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,464
The thing is, she needs
to see the both of you together.

571
00:30:58,464 --> 00:31:01,159
- Leave us alone.
- Ricki, your daughter needs help.

572
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,496
- Get away, before I call the police.
- Miss Austin, I am the police.

573
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,910
Then it's damn lucky
I have my own security.

574
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,742
Morning, Olivia.

575
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,614
This doesn't look like
the makings of a pleasant day.

576
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,950
Ashley's called already, six times.

577
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,499
- What's wrong?
- Don't ask.

578
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:32,933
- Benson, you're on desk duty.
- Captain, I can explain.

579
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:36,160
You can't follow my orders on the street,
you try keeping my files straight.

580
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,265
Captain... / And in case anyone else here...
has Det. Benson's hearing problem...

581
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,500
read my lips or buy
the CliffsNotes.

582
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,936
No one is to go near
Ashley Black again.

583
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:49,574
That includes her family, school,
house, and any employees therein.

584
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,207
You can't do this.
Somebody's gotta help her.

585
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:57,641
Really. Well, thanks to you,
now none of us can.

586
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:06,357
It's a restraining order...

587
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:09,502
against the whole unit.

588
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:21,406
Alex, you can't imagine
how needy this little girl is.

589
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,976
"Needy?"  Olivia, we do
sex crimes and child abuse.

590
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,011
I'm sorry, but there's
not much we can do...

591
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,746
for the emotionally short-changed.

592
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,315
What about abandonment?

593
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,051
Her parents tour nine months
out of the year.

594
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:37,588
Her father is a documented alcoholic.
And what about Corbin?

595
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,425
That was a traffic accident.

596
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:46,130
The autopsy report lists physical
evidence of long-term stress.

597
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,100
He internalized, she externalizes.

598
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,470
- You're speculating.
- Not about Ashley's disorder.

599
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,774
Ashley's tantrums,
her running away, her accidents.

600
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,078
- It could only escalate.
- Olivia, why are you doing this?

601
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:03,254
Because this kid is in trouble.

602
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,052
We might have imminent risk of harm.

603
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,455
There must be something
that you can do about that.

604
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:14,819
Maybe, but we still have
one major hurdle.

605
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:17,899
Are you trying to get fired?
Because that's the only option I have left.

606
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:20,965
Would I put myself on the line
if I didn't know what was in store...

607
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,601
- for this little girl?
- She's been hurting herself for years.

608
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,370
We can subpoena her
medical records.

609
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,038
And her teacher and the headmaster.

610
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,040
They saw the problem,
but did nothing about it.

611
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,977
- Parents wouldn't let them.
- What are you thinking?

612
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:37,215
An Article 10 proceeding.
We can remove the girl from the home.

613
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,250
That is gonna play great in the press.

614
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,852
It's family court, not criminal.

615
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,754
And I've already made
a couple of phone calls.

616
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,689
There isn't a less disruptive avenue?

617
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,324
None that Ricki can't circumvent.

618
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,227
She's already circumvented us.
We're under a restraining order.

619
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,791
It's an active investigation.
I'll get it lifted.

620
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,748
Do it.

621
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,476
- Olivia!
- No, please, don't do that.

622
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:09,856
Ashley, honey, look at me.
I want you to go with Det. Stabler.

623
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:11,904
It's okay. I want you to go with Det.
Stabler, okay?

624
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:13,251
- Honey, come.
- Please, no.

625
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,720
- It's okay, I'll be right out.
- I don't wanna go with you.

626
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,688
I wanna stay with Olivia.
Let go of me!

627
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:21,159
This isn't fair. Let go of me!

628
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,128
This warrant charges you
with impairment of emotional health...

629
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,165
Article 10, Section 1024,
of the Family Court Act.

630
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,332
Impairment of what?

631
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,069
You do have the right to be
present at a hearing on Thursday...

632
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,244
at which time a judge will
determine Ashley's placement.

633
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,314
Why are you doing this to me?

634
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:48,698
This isn't about you,
it's about Ashley.

635
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,255
I'll be back in a minute.

636
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:00,765
- So?
- Nothing.

637
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,267
- Anything?
- That's it.

638
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,204
- I'm empty.
- No family member will take her.

639
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,591
No one wants to lose
their meal ticket.

640
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,111
So what happens now?

641
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,880
Emergency foster care
for tonight. / Where?

642
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,316
There's room at Laight Street.

643
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:22,688
- I'll drop her off.
- No, I'll drive her there.

644
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,490
Can we go home to
your house now?

645
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,626
Sweetie, we're not going
to my house.

646
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:33,297
What?
But you came and got me.

647
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,434
- You don't want me to live with you?
- It's not that, Ashley...

648
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,437
it's just that my house isn't
set up for kids.

649
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,807
- That's okay.
- And even if it was...

650
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,275
I'm hardly ever there.

651
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:48,779
You know, my work, it just...
It takes up all my time.

652
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,110
You understand that,
Ashley, don't you?

653
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,459
What are you still doing here?

654
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:12,904
- You drop her off at Laight Street?
- Yeah.

655
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:16,539
Never been there before.

656
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:22,690
It's a room filled with
a dozen cots.

657
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,552
It's been about a month now,hasn't it?

658
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,954
Since what?

659
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:34,992
- Your mom.
- Where did that come from?

660
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:38,663
Olivia, it's me.
I know the issues you had with her.

661
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,799
No. No connection.

662
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,002
Successful woman, rarely home,
when she was home, she was drunk.

663
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,637
You were lonely and neglected...

664
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:51,560
and you never had a chance to resolve
the thing before she died?

665
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:57,127
You're wrong.

666
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,012
I'll get you a coffee.

667
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,827
MANHATTAN FAMILY COURT
60 LAFAYETTE STREET
THURSDAY, JANUARY 25

668
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,446
Your Honor, James Woodrow...

669
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:14,031
for the respondents,
Ricki Austin and Jared Black.

670
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,768
I'm filing a 1028 application
to return the minor to her parents.

671
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:21,138
- Fine. I'll hear that right now.
- Your Honor, we feel that...

672
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,840
I'm gravely distressed by the fact...

673
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,910
that police bypassed this court
and took the extreme measure...

674
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,678
of removing a minor from her home.

675
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:30,414
You Honor, the minor has
a chronic history of self-injurious...

676
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,750
behavior casually linked
to the home situation...

677
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,621
Save it for later.
I promise we won't forget about you.

678
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,023
Mr. Woodrow, you're up.

679
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,193
I call Ricki Austin.

680
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,228
We were dirt poor...

681
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,197
so I always swore
that if I made any money...

682
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,000
I was gonna spend all
of it on my children.

683
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,169
I wanted them to have
everything they ever wanted.

684
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,972
- Everything I never had.
- In order to do that...

685
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,742
you've been very driven
in your career, haven't you?

686
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,444
I'm a workaholic. I admit it.

687
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,647
Has that kept you from
loving your daughter?

688
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,816
No.

689
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,586
Ashley was my miracle baby.

690
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:13,624
My first song to become number one,
was about her birth.

691
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,762
Sixteen million people could
relate to a mother's love.

692
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,931
- Is that domestic or worldwide?
- Your Honor...

693
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:25,777
We have contempt charges here
in family court also, Miss Cabot.

694
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:27,705
The woman who started
these proceedings...

695
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:32,476
Detective Benson. / How did she
become involved in your life?

696
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,980
When I lost my son, Corbin...

697
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,183
I was out of my mind with grief.

698
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,652
I was convinced that a man
had been hurting him...

699
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,922
and she was one of the detectives
assigned to the case.

700
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,824
And during the investigation...

701
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,394
did it become necessary
to take out a restraining order?

702
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,830
- Objection.
- Overruled.

703
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:59,028
I had to. Det. Benson became
obsessed with Ashley.

704
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,306
Miss Austin, did you
ever grow concerned...

705
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,710
over the inordinate number
of injuries your daughter has?

706
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,915
Ashley's full of life.
It's hard to contain that energy.

707
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,951
I mean, all kids have accidents.
I know I always did.

708
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,221
Kids will be kids.

709
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:21,392
On July 13, 1996,
Ashley sprained her wrist.

710
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,794
Where were you?

711
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,464
I... It was a long time ago, I know.

712
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,565
Maybe this will help.

713
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:31,804
It's your tour schedule
for the last five years.

714
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:37,341
I gave a concert in Chicago.

715
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:43,414
And on December 9, 1997?

716
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,317
The German leg of
my European tour.

717
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,653
Also the date Ashley
dislocated her elbow.

718
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:54,058
Where were you for
her multiple rib fractures?

719
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:58,062
- What date is that?
- Dates. I said multiple.

720
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:02,700
March 23, 1998,
August 9, 1999. / Stop it.

721
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,707
There are also lacerations to the upper
and lower extremities. / Objection.

722
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:09,883
A periorbital fracture,
various foreign bodies lodged

723
00:40:09,883 --> 00:40:12,444
- in her ears...a fractured left femur.
- Stop it.

724
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:15,713
Objection! / Contusions and abrasions
to the forehead,  chin, hands and knees.

725
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,959
That's enough, Miss Cabot.

726
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,754
All of these injuries correlate
to dates you were away.

727
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:29,226
You never saw them as a desperate
cry for Mommy to come home?

728
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,296
I love my daughter.

729
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:36,333
I loved both of my children.

730
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,636
I gave them the best of everything.

731
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:44,141
The best schools, the best nannies,
the best home.

732
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:48,039
I did everything I could for them.

733
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:55,186
No further questions.

734
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,723
You may step down, Miss Austin.

735
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:03,386
Bailiff, bring in the child.

736
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:17,074
- Hello, Ashley.
- Hi.

737
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:21,579
Do you know why
you're here today?

738
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:27,051
- Do you know Det. Benson?
- She used to be my friend.

739
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:33,457
- "Used to be?"
- I wanted to live with her.

740
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,660
But she didn't want me.

741
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,937
My daddy's home.

742
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,946
I am ordering the minor
be returned to her parents.

743
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:59,583
But the Article 10 will continue.
I am recommending that ACS...

744
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,820
monitor the home,
and set up family counseling.

745
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,389
I want a status report
in one month.

746
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,124
There won't be much to report,
Your Honor...

747
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,260
because she begins
a three-month tour next week...

748
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,563
and her daughter needs
to be in school. / Ms. Austin?

749
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:18,023
- I'll postpone that tour, Your Honor.
- Wise decision.

750
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,013
I want you to know that
my only concern was for Ashley.

751
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:34,873
You ever get near her again,
I'll have your badge.

752
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,050
Gorgeous!

753
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,103
How is it out there
in the real world?

754
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:56,106
Give him a few more days
to cool off.

755
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,208
He'll let you off ass-duty.

756
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,512
Just in time for my hearing
in front of the disciplinary committee.

757
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,549
- I see them next week.
- Was it worth it?

758
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:10,935
I don't know.
I think it woke her up.

759
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:25,436
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

760
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:31,101
Ricki Austin played to a sold-out crowd
