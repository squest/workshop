1
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,189
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,833
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,435
In New York City,

4
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,681
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,752
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:39,329
These are their stories.

7
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,574
So I got all the cables hooked up.

8
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,610
I tried to print, nothing.

9
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,579
My 10-year-old comes over,
a few clicks on the mouse, it works.

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,463
It's getting so that
you can't navigate a computer,

11
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:51,084
it's like being illiterate.

12
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,619
We're dinosaurs.

13
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,355
31, silent alarm at Lorenzo Storage.

14
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,591
569 West 124 Street.

15
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,460
Sector car's at the house.
Let's take it.

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,429
One Sergeant responding.

17
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,230
Copy that, One Sergeant.

18
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,082
You okay?

19
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,251
Banged my foot on some piece of crap.

20
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,543
You want to check over there?

21
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,291
I don't see anything.

22
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,502
Karen?

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,604
Karen?

24
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,540
Service, we're right around
the corner going to back up...

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,009
One Sergeant at Lorenzo Storage.

26
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,937
Karen?

27
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,546
You in there?

28
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,648
One David.
ETA to Lorenzo Storage, one minute.

29
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,484
We got backup on the way!

30
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,583
You hold on!

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,554
10-13.

32
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,257
One Sergeant.
10-13 at this location.

33
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,357
Officer needs help!

34
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,163
What's up?

35
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,665
We got a 10-13 eight blocks away.

36
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,667
You all right?

37
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,936
Yeah. I'll drive.

38
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,071
It's the pills, isn't it?

39
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,873
Yeah.

40
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,307
Ambulance is on the way.

41
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,309
Wish they got here as fast as you did.

42
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,611
What happened?

43
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,514
Sergeant and the driver took
a call for a silent alarm break-in.

44
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,682
They got separated,
perp grabbed the Sergeant.

45
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,750
Where'd you find her?

46
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,419
In the stairwell with her pants down.
Looks like he raped her...

47
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,255
after he put a garbage bag
over her head.

48
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,558
The perp got out of the building through
an emergency exit in the stairwell...

49
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,555
with her gun and wallet.

50
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,266
How's she doing?

51
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,400
Pretty bad.

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,736
We didn't move her in case she hurt
her neck or something.

53
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,081
The perp used some kind of
blunt object to choke her.

54
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:54,707
A piece of pipe or something.

55
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,775
A crowbar?

56
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,744
Make sure they check
for prints on the door.

57
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,212
CSU's en route.

58
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,142
The rest of the squad's
looking for the doer.

59
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,488
Oh, God.

60
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,957
What's the matter?

61
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,759
That's Karen Smythe.

62
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,858
She trained me.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/02/16

74
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,051
How long was she in there?

75
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,286
I'm not sure.

76
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,954
At least five minutes.

77
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,322
More like ten.

78
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,724
Felt like an hour.

79
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,292
Take it easy, Mitch.

80
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,361
I got too far ahead of her.

81
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,429
All I could do was bang on that door.

82
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,931
You scared the perp off.

83
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,033
Come on. You can't be
blaming yourself, all right?

84
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,534
I'm her partner.

85
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,503
Guys, my boss has just arrived.

86
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,639
I expect all of you down
at our offices in an hour.

87
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,670
Anything we can do.

88
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,944
How's she doing?

89
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,012
Semi-conscious.

90
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,549
Doctor says her airway wasn't cut off

91
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:42,482
long enough to cause any brain damage.

92
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,549
Where's your partner?

93
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,118
She's in there with her.

94
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,547
They've got history.

95
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,990
She able to give you anything?

96
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,058
Not yet.

97
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,126
What'd the partner say?

98
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,193
Nothing too reliable.

99
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,396
- The guy's still in shock.
- You know her, Olivia?

100
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,463
She got any family?

101
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,765
Just her ex-husband.

102
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,066
We'll do the notification.

103
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,168
I'm going to stay with her
in case she wakes up.

104
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,737
Okay. Look, everybody's
working this one.

105
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,407
Nobody's going home.
She wakes up, says anything...

106
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,404
I'll call you.

107
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:14,643
Special Victims Unit Squad Room
Friday, February 9

108
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,867
He broke in through this door...

109
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,970
raped and robbed
Sergeant Karen Smythe...

110
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,474
and now this perp has
a cop's gun as a trophy.

111
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,142
We got to get him in fast.

112
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,410
Anything from Forensics?

113
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,512
Found the crowbar outside
the back of the warehouse.

114
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,711
CSU went to the hospital to see

115
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,216
if the rust on it matches
marks on Sergeant Smythe.

116
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,751
Similar burglaries?

117
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,785
Checking.

118
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,722
Crowbar isn't exactly
a unique method of entry.

119
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,591
It's possible this guy was a burglar
who saw a woman alone...

120
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,527
as an opportunity,
but for now we rule nothing out.

121
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,064
Any other rape cases

122
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:06,561
where the perp used a garbage bag
to cover the victim's head?

123
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,770
I'll call on that.

124
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,039
Everybody else,
hit the street.

125
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,509
Canvass for perp sightings,
possible witnesses.

126
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,278
Finding this guy is job one.
He tried to kill a cop.

127
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,503
He's not going to care
who his next victim is.

128
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,953
You look like the one who got strangled.

129
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,020
I'm okay.

130
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,914
Elliot, a minute?

131
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,993
You forgot to call on the pattern rapes.

132
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,161
I was just getting to it.

133
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,163
Elliot. Get some rest.

134
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,299
A cop was just raped
and nearly choked to death.

135
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,835
This anti-HIV medicine
is still making you sick.

136
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,670
Take some time until you're done with it.

137
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,272
You think I'm not up to the job?

138
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,741
You saved a life,
exposed yourself to HIV.

139
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,109
You have nothing to prove.

140
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,538
- Is it an order?
- Not yet.

141
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,247
Trust me to come to you
if it's a problem.

142
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,590
We came up the back stairs,
heard pounding on the door.

143
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,427
Followed the noise to the front stairs,
came down.

144
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,195
Sergeant Smythe was lying there.

145
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,630
Any sign of the perp?

146
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,864
Nothing but the crowbar.

147
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,099
We didn't go after him.

148
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,834
We were more concerned
about the Sarge.

149
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,736
Where were you guys
when you got the call?

150
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,205
About ten blocks away,
in our sector, on a meal break.

151
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,040
You know how it is when you get a 13.

152
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,100
- Cop's in trouble, we haul ass.
- You guys work the area.

153
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,778
Anybody on your radar
could have done this?

154
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,713
That part of the precinct is skell heaven.

155
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,615
Just toss out a net and haul them in.

156
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,284
You hear anything from the hospital?

157
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,316
15 minutes ago.
She's not conscious yet.

158
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,290
When did you lose her?

159
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,426
I don't know. She was behind me,
and then she was gone.

160
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,736
The place was so dark,

161
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,696
you couldn't see your hand
in front of your face.

162
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,164
And then you saw her flashlight?

163
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:49,027
Yeah. I heard noises from
behind the stairwell door, and I, I...

164
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,442
Just breathe. Relax. Come on.
Take your time. Sit down.

165
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,677
It's hard, you know?

166
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,980
I do know. Is this when
you called for backup?

167
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,114
Yeah.

168
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,549
The door was locked.

169
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,951
It happened so fast.

170
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,819
How long before they arrived?

171
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,589
After I called the 13,

172
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,190
couldn't have been more than
a couple of minutes.

173
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,484
Bates and Towne opened
the door from the inside.

174
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,827
Hey.

175
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,607
How long you been up?

176
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,876
Couple of hours.

177
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,203
I didn't want to wake you.

178
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,947
You're still taking care of the rookie?

179
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,842
Looks like it's the other way around.

180
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,555
We're going to get this bastard, Karen.

181
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,524
You can count on that.

182
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,494
I might be worried if you were
still as green as when I got you.

183
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,699
Do you remember the time...

184
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,402
when the Lieutenant sent me up
to the roof of the precinct?

185
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,007
To turn the lights on so that
the captain could land his chopper...

186
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,509
and inspect the building?

187
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,511
You asked me...

188
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:10,016
if you needed red paddles
to guide him in.

189
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,218
- I didn't take that too well, did I?
- No!

190
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,686
No, not at all.

191
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,488
Rookie paranoia.

192
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,248
If they didn't like you,
they'd have picked on someone else.

193
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,124
Last night, I froze.

194
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,205
It was like I was outside of my body...

195
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,141
Iooking down at myself.

196
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,144
You dissociated.
That's normal.

197
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,833
I know.

198
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,476
What do you remember?

199
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,083
We were in the warehouse.

200
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,423
Mitch tripped...

201
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,058
I asked him if he was okay.

202
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,222
Couldn't see anything that wasn't
in the flashlight beam,

203
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:56,319
it was so dark.

204
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,956
Then someone grabbed me by the throat.

205
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,363
Put something over my head.

206
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,641
What was it?

207
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,706
It was a plastic bag.

208
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,580
Then he dragged me...

209
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,248
then he threw me down...

210
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,684
tore my pants off...

211
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,284
and then he was inside me.

212
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,584
He never said a word.

213
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,463
Then he put something hard
against my throat.

214
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,797
Like a pipe.

215
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,832
Yeah.

216
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,092
We think that was the crowbar
that he used to break in.

217
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,727
I couldn't breathe.

218
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:46,033
Next thing, I'm looking at you
sleeping there.

219
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,954
Was the rape kit positive?

220
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,557
It's not back yet,
but the Luma Light didn't show anything.

221
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,092
Any suspects?

222
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,952
Not yet.

223
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,792
Then stop babysitting me
and go find one.

224
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,292
Okay.

225
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,675
Hey...

226
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,243
you feeling any better?

227
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,211
Yeah. I caught some sleep up in the crib.

228
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,514
- How's Smythe?
- She's awake.

229
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,915
She's going to be okay.

230
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,051
- Say anything?
- No.

231
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,186
You sure you're okay?

232
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,912
You tell Cragen about
what happened last night?

233
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,289
Me getting sick?

234
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,591
You heard what I said.
You were standing right there.

235
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,993
I haven't seen him since.
Why?

236
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,661
Boss wanted to send me home.

237
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,264
But he didn't.
Good decision.

238
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,566
But that stuff right there,
that'll kill you.

239
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,268
Yeah. Have you been
in the squad room?

240
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,595
- No. Why?
- Hold your nose.

241
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,573
- Lab call yet?
- Nope.

242
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,642
They're taking their sweet time.

243
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,331
Sit.

244
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,113
I can't take much more of this stench.

245
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,387
Eau de cologne of the streets.

246
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:58,484
The sights, sounds,
aromas of the "other" New York.

247
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,049
This guy you need gloves to handle.

248
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,989
You know where you are?

249
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,058
It ain't an outhouse.

250
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,427
It ain't the White House.

251
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,730
So it might be the stationhouse.

252
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,831
Good guess.

253
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,201
Easier to sweep the sands off the beach
than get anything out of these guys.

254
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,630
Hey, we got a live one.

255
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,739
Overtime?

256
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,873
Our own time.

257
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,708
What's so special about this one?

258
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,043
This.

259
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,746
We found him sleeping down
the block from the warehouse.

260
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,013
Nice work.

261
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,682
You want in on this interrogation?

262
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,283
No. We just want to get some sleep.

263
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,816
He comes up as the doer,
collar's all yours.

264
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,256
You're in deep doo-doo.

265
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,625
I swear, I found it in a dumpster.

266
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,314
When?

267
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,395
I don't wear no watch.

268
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,730
What dumpster?

269
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,334
A few blocks from where
they found that police lady.

270
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,503
I ain't had no part in that.

271
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,406
I was sleeping in an alley during
all that commotion nonsense.

272
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,077
Let's continue this scintillating repartee
in more comfortable surroundings.

273
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,712
You got something to eat back there?

274
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,180
We'll see what we can scrounge up.

275
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,048
Okay. Thank you.

276
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,184
Guys, wait a minute.

277
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,185
What?

278
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,287
Last week, a woman in Queens
was raped...

279
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,556
nearly choked to death in a warehouse.

280
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,258
The perp broke into that warehouse...

281
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,727
using a crowbar.
Three days ago she woke up...

282
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,329
and told Queens SVU...

283
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,156
her attacker put a plastic bag
over her head.

284
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,601
A repeater.

285
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,859
Carrying a cop's gun.

286
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,274
Apartment Of Marina Garza
Long Island City, Queens
Saturday, February 10

287
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,943
I was in the back of the warehouse...

288
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,711
doing inventory.

289
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,980
What time was it?

290
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,949
About 10:30.

291
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,318
I hear footsteps...

292
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,588
and I thought it was Cathy,
this girl that I work with.

293
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,056
What happened?

294
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,986
I got down off the ladder...

295
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,895
and he grabbed me.

296
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,630
Put a bag over my head...

297
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,797
and he started punching me.

298
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,998
He threw me down on a stack of boxes...

299
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,833
and I couldn't stop him.
He raped me.

300
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,166
Did you get a look at him?

301
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,013
No.

302
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,248
After he raped you?

303
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,282
He choked me.

304
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,985
Next thing I knew,
I woke up in the hospital.

305
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,482
Did he take anything from you?

306
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,125
A gold cross that I wear around my neck.

307
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,656
He just ripped it right off.

308
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,756
What about what he said to you?

309
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,955
He didn't say a word.

310
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,564
Thank you.

311
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,714
Queens rape victim described
the same M.O. As the attack on Smythe.

312
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,650
Anything on the homeless guy
you picked up with Smythe's I.D.?

313
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,887
He spent the night swilling Mad Dog
with three of his backstreet bunkies.

314
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,221
They tell you that?

315
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,057
In a rare moment of lucidity,
after about 10 cups of coffee.

316
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,460
Okay, rule him out as our serial rapist.

317
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,527
Anything from the lab?

318
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,796
So far, zero.
They haven't called us.

319
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,532
Then get down there and light
a Bunsen burner under them.

320
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,701
Munch, Fin, check out
Smythe's past cases.

321
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,103
What are we looking for?

322
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,703
Anybody with a grudge.

323
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,475
I have five homicides from last weekend.

324
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,443
Your victim isn't even dead.
Take a number.

325
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,946
And we have a cop who may be
the victim of a serial rapist.

326
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,081
He has her gun.
This should be top priority.

327
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,483
What do you want me to tell you?

328
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,818
That you'll put your foot
on the gas instead of the brake.

329
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,253
You've had the rape kit for days.

330
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,355
Do we have to go over
your head to get things done?

331
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,823
Can't give you what I don't have.

332
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,923
Felicia, come on.
Help us out here. You know us.

333
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,497
Positive for spermicide,
negative for semen.

334
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,232
So the rapist used a condom?

335
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,466
That wasn't so hard, was it?

336
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,701
Spare me the sarcasm.

337
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,437
- So, there's no DNA?
- No, I didn't say that.

338
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,474
Rape kit turned up one hair,
follicle still attached.

339
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,910
Find me a suspect,
I'll match it.

340
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,845
Anything else you want to share with us?

341
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,776
They find out I told you about the rape kit,
I'm in enough trouble.

342
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,252
What was that about?

343
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,510
Someone's covering up.

344
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,414
What do you say we take another look?

345
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:06,765
Lorenzo Storage 569 W. 124th Street
Monday, February 12

346
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,830
Seal's broken.

347
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,774
Looks like somebody's done
some housekeeping.

348
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,010
So much for securing the crime scene.

349
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,936
- What the hell is going on?
- Let's find out.

350
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,382
They were in here this morning.

351
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,516
Who?

352
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,553
Two cops in windbreakers.
Said they had to finish collecting evidence.

353
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,088
Don't you guys talk to each other?

354
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,390
They tell you what unit they were from?

355
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,258
Why would I need to know that?

356
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,661
Someone ran a hose in there.

357
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,931
Yeah, I delegated it to one of
my numerous employees. Me.

358
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,565
Did you ask these cops
if that was okay?

359
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,558
It was their idea.

360
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,582
Hey! Get away from my desk!
What're you doing?

361
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,417
Private property,
gentlemen.

362
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,953
Lieutenants Coates and Waldman,
Internal Affairs...

363
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,489
Detectives Stabler and Benson.

364
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,858
You find anything incriminating
in my wife's photo?

365
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,060
If you're hungry,
I left a candy bar there.

366
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,030
It's a Hershey bar on the second
drawer on the left. Sorry, no cheese.

367
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,598
We're going to have to ask you
some questions.

368
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,832
About what?

369
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,601
It won't take long.

370
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,369
Use your office, Captain?

371
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,038
Yeah. Sure, why not?

372
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,468
My desk is unlocked if you need anything.

373
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,313
Have a seat.

374
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,715
We'll stand. Thanks.

375
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,712
What's this about?

376
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,221
Is all the paperwork on your cases
for the last month up to date?

377
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,624
We wouldn't be doing our job
properly if it wasn't.

378
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,691
So that's a yes.

379
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,727
Is this going anywhere?
We've got work to do.

380
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,795
So do we.

381
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,997
We'll need all your files by
the end of business today.

382
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,325
You want our files, you're looking
through our desks. For what?

383
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,804
This about the Smythe case?

384
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,779
Lab's holding back,
crime scene's been cleaned up.

385
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,041
What's going on?

386
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,276
Thanks for your cooperation.

387
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,068
Thank you.

388
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,914
Internal Affairs investigates crooked cops.

389
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,582
We know we're clean.

390
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,584
The KGB of the NYPD.

391
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,154
Cast suspicion like McCarthy,
keep secret files like J. Edgar Hoover...

392
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,523
get everybody to the point
where they trust nobody.

393
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,225
What are you talking about now?

394
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:17,529
I'm talking about these field associates.
IAB recruits fresh out of the academy...

395
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,499
who become spies among us.
Moles ratting on their fellow cops...

396
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,568
until they put in their 20
and collect their pension.

397
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,969
I don't like them any better than you...

398
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,038
but you're honest,
you got nothing to worry about.

399
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,108
There's 40,000 cops on the job.
There's bound to be a few bad apples.

400
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,242
What'd they want?

401
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,410
Case files.

402
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,012
Case files for the last month.

403
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,648
Either one of us could be
under investigation.

404
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,217
Or both of us.

405
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,318
Maybe Karen Smythe.

406
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,952
Karen Smythe wouldn't
take a cup of coffee.

407
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,916
Whatever you say.

408
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,249
We got files to deliver.

409
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,232
IAB sniffing around gives me the creeps.

410
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,735
A little bit of the former Soviet bloc's
policing methods here in New York.

411
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,437
Guilty until proven innocent.

412
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,240
But even if you're innocent,
the stigma of an IAB inquiry...

413
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,941
sticks to you like a bad debt.

414
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,176
Where do you get this stuff?

415
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,812
Simple observations.
What did you find out?

416
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,249
Nothing I was going to say in front of
Benson after that reaction.

417
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,618
Smythe and her husband
got divorced a year ago.

418
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,119
Irreconcilable differences?

419
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,688
Hubby taking too many trips
to Atlantic City.

420
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,191
Almost drove her into
bankruptcy with his gambling.

421
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,561
Had to sell the house last summer
to pay off the credit card debt...

422
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,730
to the tune of $70,000.

423
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,331
The cost of freedom.

424
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,366
For her.

425
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,035
He's still paying his bills
late as of last month.

426
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,404
That one of the 12 steps?

427
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,000
Maybe we should ask him.

428
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:37,476
Triborough Bakery 225
KingsBridge Avenue
Tuesday, February 13

429
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,777
Thank God she's okay.

430
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,546
You still on speaking terms?

431
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:44,016
She called to tell me what happened.
We don't talk that often.

432
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,417
How long were you married?

433
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,985
Twelve years.

434
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,687
Honeymoon lasted ten.

435
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,557
Tough being married to a cop.
Just ask my ex-wives.

436
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,125
It was tough being married to me.

437
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,795
She risks her life to earn a living,
I blow both our salaries gambling.

438
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,130
It's what broke us up.

439
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,398
You're on the wagon now?

440
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,867
When she left me,
I went to Gamblers Anonymous.

441
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,834
I'm clean.

442
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,169
Well, your credit report isn't.

443
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,471
You're still borrowing money
against your credit cards...

444
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,874
- and forgetting to pay it back.
- So?

445
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,609
Sounds like you had a relapse.

446
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,177
You're still gambling.

447
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,778
You borrowing any money from
somebody doesn't have a license to lend?

448
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,050
I borrowed from a friend.

449
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,484
You mean a loan shark.

450
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,086
How much?

451
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,154
$100,000.

452
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,655
What's the balance on the account?

453
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,623
Zero.

454
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,158
How'd you pay it off?

455
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:30,487
$50,000 on my own.
The other $50,000, anonymous donor.

456
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,232
Hey, I thought the same thing.

457
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,534
Don't play games with us.
The odds are against you.

458
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,203
No games. I meet him
yesterday to make a payment...

459
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,438
he says it's taken care of.

460
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,840
Taken care of, huh?
Somebody pays off your gambling debt...

461
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,676
and you have no idea who would
perform such an act of philanthropy?

462
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,180
These guys don't just let you
walk away from an obligation.

463
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,116
All I know is that vulture's not
banging down my door any more.

464
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,218
Vulture got a name?

465
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,153
I just know him as Uncle Sammy.

466
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,048
Hangs out in Chinatown.
Mott Street.

467
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,661
Uncle Sammy.

468
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,396
Can I help you gentlemen?

469
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,331
Yeah. I want to borrow some money.

470
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,834
I'm sorry, but you must be
mistaking me for a bank.

471
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,337
We take it you specialize in loans
to police officers and their families.

472
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,473
Somebody's giving you bad information.

473
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,742
You going to stick to that story?

474
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,776
Wait.

475
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,678
Come on.

476
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,047
What have we here?

477
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,750
"50 Misha W-3 Hiya."

478
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,318
- Who's Misha?
- My dog.

479
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,821
This knot's for dog food?
The mutt must be eating porterhouse.

480
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,889
I'm an animal lover.

481
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,358
That's good. Because we got
a cage waiting for you at Rikers.

482
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,861
After we arrest you for possession
of these betting slips...

483
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,562
that's where you're spending the night.

484
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,064
Guys, what do you want?

485
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,166
Who paid off Todd Smythe's loan?

486
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,901
What loan?
Who's Todd Smythe?

487
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,470
I guess we're going to have to destroy
those illegal documents.

488
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,972
Then he has to explain to his clients...

489
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,173
why there's no record of their bets...

490
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,075
when they come to collect their winnings.

491
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,744
I got a right not to incriminate myself.

492
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,613
And we have a right to arrest you.

493
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,417
Unless you got something else
you want to tell us.

494
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,952
Smythe owed me another $50,000.

495
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,020
Owed?

496
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,155
It was paid off.

497
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,119
- By who?
- His ex-wife.

498
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:15,500
Uncle Sammy tell you how she came up
with the better part of a year's salary?

499
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,768
He didn't ask.

500
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:20,403
My ex's wouldn't throw water
on me if I was on fire.

501
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,375
We're finished playing
messenger service.

502
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,711
Let IAB come and get those files.

503
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,913
Any idea who they have their sights on?

504
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,648
Yeah.

505
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,542
Karen Smythe.

506
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,624
You're saying I'm on the take?

507
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,027
I'm saying that your husband's
loan shark says...

508
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,995
that you paid off his $50,000 debt.

509
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,164
- And you believe him?
- Convince me that he's lying.

510
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,033
I don't have to prove anything to you.

511
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,200
This time, you do.

512
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,406
Where'd you get the money, Karen?

513
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,942
None of this concerns you, Olivia.

514
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,444
Boy, I am running out of reasons
to defend you.

515
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,846
Then back off.

516
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,848
I'm doing what you taught me.

517
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,641
My job.
Investigating your rape.

518
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,484
I wasn't raped.

519
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,724
I remember what happened now.

520
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,626
I wasn't raped.

521
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,128
Karen, what're you talking about?

522
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:20,165
They found you in a stairwell with
your pants pulled down, nearly strangled.

523
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,634
The rape kit was positive
for spermicide, remember?

524
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:23,969
You going to recant that, too?

525
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,737
I had sex before I went on duty.

526
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,938
With who?

527
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,340
An old boyfriend.

528
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,341
His name?

529
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,543
- He's married.
- We both know that you're going to...

530
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,370
have to eliminate him as a suspect,
so what's his name?

531
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,184
Karen, don't do this.

532
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,908
You want to help?

533
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,854
Drop it.

534
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,990
Who got to you?
Who are you covering for?

535
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,224
Don't push me.

536
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,726
What kind of trouble are you in?

537
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,223
You're the one causing it.

538
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:57,464
Well, let's ask Internal Affairs about it
and see what they have to say.

539
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,865
Get out.

540
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,278
She didn't give you anything?

541
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,979
She shut me down.

542
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,349
Chief of Detectives says without her,
we don't have a rape case.

543
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,618
She's recanting her story
because she's scared.

544
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,253
Someone's putting the screws to her.

545
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,822
Did you check her financial records?

546
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,124
No loans,
no cash advances...

547
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,294
no $50,000 withdrawn from
any of her savings accounts.

548
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,895
She's not dirty.

549
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,096
You gotta do something.

550
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,966
I'm going to see the Chief of Departments.

551
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,768
That sounds like a suicide mission.

552
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,470
Let's hope not.
He's a friend.

553
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,573
Maybe he knows
who's trying to shut us down.

554
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,674
We can't let this go.

555
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,239
We're not. It's our turf.

556
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,847
I'm returning the doctor's call.

557
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:45,217
The message said
he had my test results.

558
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:49,478
I understand that, but if you have them
in front of you, why can't you ju...

559
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:55,114
You need a medical degree
to read off a piece of paper?

560
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,631
Policy? Okay. Well.

561
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,334
I think you need a better policy.
Thanks a lot.

562
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,160
Problem?

563
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:08,073
My test results are back.

564
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,810
Policy dictates only a doctor can...

565
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,000
give them to me.

566
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,782
One Police Plaza
Wednesday, February 14

567
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,085
You need my help, Donnie?

568
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,655
IAB is putting the squeeze on
a couple of my detectives.

569
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,257
Maybe they did something wrong.

570
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,426
Only mistake they made
was catching the Smythe case.

571
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,795
Is IAB putting the squeeze on her, too?

572
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,366
Your victim flips on her story,
and you're blaming Internal Affairs?

573
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,869
I ran a corruption task force.
I know when a cop's being fed her lines.

574
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,838
That's a little paranoid,
don't you think?

575
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,408
Twelve years a captain,
I can't get promoted. I'm paranoid.

576
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,477
Don't take advantage of our friendship.

577
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,079
Karen Smythe is being made
to look like a wrong cop.

578
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,848
Is she one?

579
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,651
Cop's spouse is up to his ass
in debt to some loan shark...

580
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,320
it's guilt by association.
Makes us look bad.

581
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,988
A firing offense.

582
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,457
You're saying IAB knew about this?

583
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,057
Then why wasn't she fired?

584
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,231
Your victim recanted.

585
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,766
That's one side of the story.

586
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,900
Give me the other side.

587
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,835
Physical evidence that
a rape took place...

588
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,271
and three decades of cop
instinct screaming at me.

589
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,773
What are your little voices saying?

590
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,241
Coverup.

591
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,477
Internal Affairs is
forcing Smythe to recant.

592
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:23,315
The Police Department is suppressing
a crime committed against one of its own?

593
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,349
Any idea why?

594
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,351
That's what we're trying to find out.

595
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,918
I'm out of options, Counselor.
I need your juice.

596
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,182
Let me talk to the victim first.

597
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,795
What are you doing here?

598
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,863
Your neighbor told me
you were down here.

599
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,866
Can't I get any privacy from you people?

600
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,935
I am here to urge you to reconsider.

601
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,537
You mean threaten.

602
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,871
I mean do the right thing.

603
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,740
Right for who?

604
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,908
You're a cop.

605
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,644
I don't have to tell you
the answer to that.

606
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,641
I'm a victim.

607
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,384
Victims usually want justice.

608
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,653
If you're saying now
that you were never raped...

609
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,357
that means that you're obstructing it
and that you filed a false report.

610
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,925
The threat surfaces.

611
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,360
It doesn't have to be this way.

612
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,428
Yes, it does.

613
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,663
Why?

614
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,033
Because for me it's a lose-lose situation.

615
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,402
Please, tell me what that means.

616
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,971
I've lost enough already.

617
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,041
Now, this is my choice.

618
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,038
Don't make it my last.

619
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,050
We're back.

620
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,188
- What's this about?
- You're under arrest.

621
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,823
- For what?
- Loan sharking and lying.

622
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,126
- You have the right to remain silent...
- What'd I lie about?

623
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,628
Are you going to tell us who really
paid Todd Smythe's loan?

624
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,330
I told you, his ex.

625
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,533
In your business, one would
think you had better lying skills.

626
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,601
Who was it?

627
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,536
I tell you,
you gotta protect me.

628
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,570
From who?

629
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,638
Two cops.

630
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,373
Two cops paid you off?

631
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,108
Shook me down,
is more like it.

632
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,210
How?

633
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,613
Said I was going to forgive
Smythe's loan...

634
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,148
and keep my mouth shut...

635
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,384
or they'll make sure I didn't see
daylight for a quarter of a century.

636
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,653
And you thought $50,000
was a small price to pay?

637
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,954
Cost of doing business.

638
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,389
What'd these two cops look like?

639
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:15,293
New suits, trench coats,
a lot of misplaced attitude.

640
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,962
Sounds like two cheese-eating
lieutenants we know.

641
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,364
Say anything else?

642
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,365
Yeah.

643
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,803
They said I could take
the loss as a tax deduction.

644
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,993
All right. Take a walk.

645
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,809
You're going to have us arrested?

646
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,410
Who the hell do you think you are?

647
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,013
I suggest you adjust your tone, Lieutenant.

648
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,750
And I suggest you adjust
your attitude, Counselor.

649
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,853
Charging us with obstruction of
justice won't get you anywhere.

650
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,321
It got your attention.

651
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,558
Now that we have it,
here's the deal.

652
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,827
You tell us why Karen Smythe
changed her story...

653
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,795
you hand over all your
case files and notes,

654
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,464
and we won't go through with this.

655
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,531
You're bluffing.

656
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,233
You think so? Try me.

657
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,569
You're covering up
the rape of a fellow cop.

658
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,270
You just don't get it,
do you?

659
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,772
Read them their rights, Captain.

660
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:04,342
Do that, and a year's worth of
undercover work goes down the toilet.

661
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,311
Who's the target of your investigation?

662
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,812
Do not make us tell you that.

663
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,047
Sorry, not buying.

664
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,549
You want to blow
both your careers, go ahead.

665
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,480
You think the D.A.'s office doesn't know
what we're doing here, Counselor?

666
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,425
We're not above the law, either.
I will subpoena anyone I have to.

667
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,060
And you'll be making a big mistake.

668
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,778
The only mistake was
trying to make a felony disappear

669
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,264
to protect your own case.

670
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,166
Now that's a crime, fellas.

671
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,001
We'll see who's blowing their career.

672
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,862
Are you going to tell us
what this is all about?

673
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,469
- Not without our lawyers.
- Fine.

674
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:39,936
Bring them down to SVU tomorrow morning
when you surrender yourselves.

675
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:48,052
Second month on the job,
responded to a two-year old, raped.

676
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,220
I wanted to quit.

677
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,123
I'm surprised it took you that long.
I was ready to go after a week.

678
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,059
It was Karen that said that I had talent
for dealing with the victim.

679
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,529
She said that I could turn
a negative into a positive. So...

680
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,830
here I am.

681
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,031
Hope you've had your coffee.

682
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,099
Why, what's up?

683
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,993
You got a visitor.

684
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,903
Speak of the devil.

685
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,296
Don't say I didn't warn you.

686
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,709
Do I have to file a formal
complaint to stop you?

687
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,979
How do you know we're still
investigating? IAB tell you?

688
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,148
They paid your husband's
loan sharking debt.

689
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,818
You never could let things go,
could you?

690
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,152
I'm sorry?

691
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,088
You know, like that singer...

692
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,559
who put a restraining order on you
when you wouldn't leave her daughter alone.

693
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,862
- You're out of line.
- I was trying to protect her daughter.

694
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,164
How do you know about that?

695
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,834
You better watch yourself.

696
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,202
What's that supposed to mean?

697
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,536
Sounded like a threat to me.

698
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,864
Just friendly advice. Lay off.

699
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,910
I'm sure I'm mistaken, Sergeant,
but I thought I heard you tell...

700
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,714
two of my detectives to ignore
a case I assigned to them.

701
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,249
No.

702
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,650
You're not mistaken.

703
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,853
I guess you'll tell them
to back off, then, Captain.

704
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,955
Because you have your orders...

705
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,747
don't you?

706
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,196
She's got a pair of onions,
talking to you like that.

707
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,831
What orders?

708
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,701
Call just came down.
We're officially off the case.

709
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,504
Now Smythe knew that.
What the hell's going on here?

710
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,242
Whatever it is, it's right in front of us
and we're not seeing it.

711
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,577
Burying the rape buys IAB a case.

712
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,179
But not against Karen...

713
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,947
they tried to protect her.

714
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,916
Which means they need her
for something.

715
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,953
IAB investigates crooked cops.
What about the people around her?

716
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,788
We need to revisit the night of the rape.

717
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,581
Right down to the smallest detail.

718
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:53,978
Can I help you?

719
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,770
Yeah. Hey.

720
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,717
Detective Stabler, SVU.
I'm working the Smythe case.

721
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,620
Sergeant said she left
her address book in her car...

722
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,722
wanted to know if I could try
and find it for her.

723
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:08,230
You got the wrong car, man.
Hers is over there.

724
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,893
Where?

725
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,461
Over there.
Right, see over there.

726
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,992
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Good. Thanks.

727
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,834
You got it?

728
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:20,162
Used to data sergeant down
in Communications.

729
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,974
Karen knew about the restraining order.

730
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,176
You were disciplined.
It's in your personnel file.

731
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,678
How would she have access to that?

732
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,147
Maybe she read it in your IAB file.

733
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,381
What are you talking about?

734
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,036
You know, your "other" personnel file...
with every infraction

735
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,987
you ever committed that
someone secretly or not-so-secretly...

736
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,089
ratted on you about.

737
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,892
Like the secret files... kept by
the NYPD's now-defunct Red Squad.

738
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,094
Hey, Cap.

739
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,229
I think we got something.

740
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,531
What's up?

741
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,934
I'm listening to radio calls from
the night of the attack on Smythe.

742
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,804
Her driver, Murray,
called in the 10-13.

743
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,607
Two seconds later,
3-1 Charlie Officers Towne and Bates...

744
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,576
- call and say they're responding.
- Okay.

745
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,545
24 seconds after that...

746
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,551
they call and say they're
arriving on the scene,

747
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:03,848
they need an ambulance.

748
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:07,018
Bates and Towne said that
they were on meal break in their sector...

749
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,253
when they got the call.
Ten blocks away.

750
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,657
So, unless the radio car comes
equipped with warp drive...

751
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,592
Or they were already there.

752
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,827
They were.

753
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,226
DNA on cigarette butts found
in their radio car

754
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:20,331
matched the hair from the rape kit.

755
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,191
Let's go.

756
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:32,877
What are you guys doing?

757
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,479
Put your hands where we can see them.

758
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,747
Mikey, they got guns out.

759
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,483
All right, Mikey, let's see
those hands. Right there.

760
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,275
Eat the street. Get down.

761
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,056
Just do as they say, Austin.

762
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,691
I see no shields.

763
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,690
- Just four pieces of crap with guns.
- I got no problem shooting you.

764
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,455
Twelve jurors or six pallbearers,
your choice.

765
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,769
Just do what they say.

766
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,937
Cops are coming, Bates.

767
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,731
Who do you think your friends are going
to side with when they get here?

768
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,415
You have the right to remain silent.

769
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,717
I know my rights, dirtbag.

770
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,053
- Don't say a word, Mikey.
- I'm not.

771
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,084
It's all over the radio.

772
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,624
- You better pick up Murray.
- Yeah.

773
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,725
We got it.

774
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,917
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

775
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,967
Murray was supposed
to watch Karen's back.

776
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,828
It was a setup.
He had to be in on it.

777
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,406
Where are you going with our suspect?

778
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,108
We're taking our prisoner to jail.

779
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,278
Officer Murray just confessed to
his part in the rape of Sergeant Smythe.

780
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,613
We got another team picking up
his two accomplices.

781
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,883
Bates and Towne? Sorry.
We just busted them.

782
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,985
We arrest crooked cops.
Not you.

783
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,088
We saved you the trouble,
didn't we?

784
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,057
You guys forget our little date this morning.

785
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,325
And what date is that?

786
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,894
The one where we bust you for obstruction.

787
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,963
Call your friend at the D.A.'s office.

788
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,200
If she still has her job she'll tell you
those charges were dropped.

789
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,268
After you two guys tried
to save yourselves

790
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,637
by arresting Murray for raping Smythe?

791
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,673
Officer Murray isn't being
charged with rape.

792
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,208
What was he arrested for?

793
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,535
Money laundering,
drug running.

794
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,489
Drug charges?

795
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,058
You don't have the authority
to okay the arrest of two cops.

796
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,795
My authority is based on airtight
physical evidence that you tried to suppress.

797
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,864
My case has priority.

798
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,600
Nicky Farnsworth is one of the biggest
drug lords in Harlem.

799
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,769
We couldn't nail him until we found out
that Bates, Towne, and Murray...

800
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,205
have been guarding his shipments for
the past year and a half.

801
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,941
Which you think gives you license
to blow my case in favor of yours?

802
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,043
Leaving Sergeant Smythe
to take one for the company.

803
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,380
You don't have the right to determine
the fate of a sex crime investigation.

804
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,082
I don't answer to you.

805
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,783
Why wasn't I at least told about this?

806
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,752
Need to know only.
You weren't on the list.

807
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,821
Three police officers set up
their own sergeant...

808
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,623
to be raped,
and probably murdered.

809
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,324
Did that ever figure into your crusade?

810
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,759
Your victim's recanted.

811
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,828
DNA evidence and
Officer Murray's testimony...

812
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,463
should be plenty to convince a jury.

813
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,864
Murray's not testifying for you.

814
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,333
We gave him immunity in exchange
for his testimony against...

815
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,728
Bates, Towne, and Farnsworth.

816
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,071
You son of a bitch.

817
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,239
A woman was raped.

818
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,008
Look, I'm sorry about
Sergeant Smythe...

819
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,410
but if you ask her,
she'll tell you she's on board with us.

820
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,145
Yeah. I can tell you're real sorry.

821
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,848
You may have flipped Murray,
but I still have Bates and Towne.

822
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,049
I'm not giving them up.

823
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,546
You don't like it,
go talk to the D.A.

824
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:32,156
Rikers Island Correctional Facility
Thursday, February 16

825
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:35,860
My client wants to reiterate
that under no circumstances...

826
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,196
will he testify about any rape.

827
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,124
That's the deal.

828
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,468
Bates and Towne came to me,
said Karen was onto us...

829
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,304
and we got to shut her up.

830
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,506
How did they find out?

831
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:52,710
A friend of Towne's saw her talking
to a known member of the rat squad.

832
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,679
Bates said we couldn't take a chance.

833
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,547
Who made the plan?

834
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,682
Bates.

835
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,250
It was all Bates.

836
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,453
And you hooked up with him how?

837
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,957
He said I can make $1,000
each time I freelanced.

838
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,327
And so you became
a permanent employee.

839
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,563
I got a kid that's going to
go to college in a few years.

840
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:16,400
So the cash would have been
a big help.

841
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,431
Why did you rape her?

842
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,901
Bates said he did it
because he had to break her.

843
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,644
He said he heard about this garbage bag
rape out in Queens...

844
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,646
be perfect for a copycat.

845
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,749
So they break into the warehouse,
they trip the alarm.

846
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,685
All I got to do is park close enough
so when the call comes...

847
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,682
we're the first to respond.

848
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,882
And then you were going to
kill her, weren't you?

849
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,066
My client has nothing to say.

850
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,669
Yeah, well, we don't need him.
We've got his DNA.

851
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,971
We found your hair on her
from the rape kit.

852
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,168
He was at the scene,
tried to help her.

853
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:57,108
The hair proves nothing.

854
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,344
He tried to help her with his pants off?

855
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,329
What's it feel like to be an errand boy

856
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,483
to some guy who sells dope
to school kids?

857
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,518
Truth hurts,
doesn't it, Austin?

858
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,354
Come on, you wanted Karen Smythe
out of the way...

859
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,624
so she wouldn't blow your second job
running drugs for Nicky Farnsworth.

860
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,494
Badger us all you want.
This'll never see the inside of a courtroom.

861
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:20,498
First degree rape, state and
federal drug charges?

862
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,133
A judge runs consecutive sentences,

863
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,101
you'll probably get out of prison in time...

864
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,203
to see your grandchildren flunk out of college.

865
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,972
Smythe'll never testify.

866
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,572
She's already talking to the D.A.

867
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,879
Fine.

868
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,548
Bitch gets on the stand...

869
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,984
the entire world finds out she's a rat.

870
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,954
We go down for rape,
her career goes down with us.

871
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,557
You guys got it figured out,
don't you?

872
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,793
Why do you think she dropped
the rape complaint?

873
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,429
Because she's a rat without a spine.

874
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,764
You rape a fellow cop.
Look at you, tough guy.

875
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,066
You're a real man,
aren't you?

876
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,534
Get outta my face!

877
00:38:56,534 --> 00:39:00,237
Couldn't even face a woman
when he was raping her, huh?

878
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,374
You had to take her
from behind in the dark.

879
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:07,168
Yeah, make you feel like
a real man, errand boy?

880
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,696
You could have told me.

881
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,365
No...

882
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,054
I couldn't.

883
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,164
I don't even know
which one of them raped me.

884
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,534
It was Bates.

885
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,401
They set me up.

886
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,384
How did you know they were
running drugs for Nicky Farnsworth?

887
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,918
I overheard Murray one night.

888
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,956
He was on the phone talking to somebody,
I don't know who.

889
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,458
Said he had to move something
for Nicky after work.

890
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,627
It happened a couple more times...

891
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:57,862
and I filled in the blanks.

892
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,297
So you went to IAB because...

893
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,967
you wanted to do the right thing.

894
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,931
Because I've been working
for them all along.

895
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,542
You're a field associate.

896
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,745
IAB came to me
when I was in the academy.

897
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,180
Said I could make a difference...

898
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,450
just by keeping my eyes and ears open.

899
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,886
They said nobody would ever find out.

900
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,951
They convinced you.

901
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,956
Didn't take convincing.

902
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,283
I love this job, Olivia.

903
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,031
Fifteen years...

904
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,568
and I still believe in what I do.

905
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,538
And when three cops
get caught running drugs...

906
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:43,908
the rest of us lose the trust
of the people we protect.

907
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,743
So IAB told you what happened?

908
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,578
In the hospital.

909
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:51,115
Said Murray, Bates,
Towne tried to kill me.

910
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,317
And they asked you to recant the rape.

911
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,619
Said if it went to trial...

912
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,690
the defense would ask me if I was
a field associate and I'd be exposed.

913
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:04,528
But I'd never have to testify
at the drug trials of these guys.

914
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,753
D.A. is indicting Bates and Towne for rape.

915
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,042
And if that happens...

916
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,377
I become a target.

917
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,942
They raped you, Karen.

918
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,048
And I have to live with that.

919
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,293
Drop the charges?

920
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,329
That's what I'm asking you to do.

921
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,965
I have bulletproof evidence.
It's a no-brainer for a jury.

922
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,167
I understand that,
but if we go ahead with this,

923
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,035
Karen Smythe's life
could be in danger.

924
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,770
She becomes a victim all over again.

925
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,306
Only this time,
it's our fault.

926
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,342
Don't ask me to let them walk on a rape.

927
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,910
Do you think that I want to?

928
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,979
I would string them up myself if I could.

929
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:59,206
We all would. But it's not
about that, it's about the law.

930
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,520
A conviction on drug charges
puts Towne and Bates...

931
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,422
away for a lot longer than
they ever would go for the rape.

932
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,953
That's not exactly justice, is it?

933
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,861
These cops took away part of her life.

934
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,086
Is it justice for us to take away the rest?

935
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,104
I will see if my bosses
will go for it. I'll just...

936
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,362
tell them to do the math.

937
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,121
Hey...

938
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,556
you following me now?

939
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,625
A cop should know where
his partner has breakfast.

940
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:45,029
Listen, you took a chance
going through that radio car.

941
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,855
Thanks.

942
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,634
Praise makes me hungry.

943
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,269
Got your appetite back.

944
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,238
Feels good to eat like
a human being again.

945
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,372
You get your test results?

946
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,107
Clean bill of health.

947
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,676
Negative for HIV...

948
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,811
hepatitis.

949
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,500
Salute.
