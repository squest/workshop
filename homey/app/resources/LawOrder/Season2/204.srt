2
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:24,629
In the criminal justice system,

3
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:28,394
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

4
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:29,585
In New York City,

5
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:33,120
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,164
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

7
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:38,779
These are their stories.

8
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:40,987
That was a sweet-looking pass.

9
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:42,568
Too bad he couldn't break it for a TD.

10
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:44,706
Hurry up, boys, or
you'll be late for school.

11
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:46,861
Imagine if we still had Keyshawn.

12
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,221
Has anyone seen Emily?

13
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:51,762
I know, but we'd really be smoking
with both guys out there. / Excuse me.

14
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:53,212
Hold on a sec.
What?

15
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:55,042
- Where's Emily?
- How should I know?

16
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,908
Well, didn't anyone bother to wake her?

17
00:00:56,908 --> 00:00:59,149
Not my responsibility.

18
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:03,772
Hurry up, Michael,
we leave in 10 minutes.

19
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,306
Emily?

20
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:12,585
Emily, come on, get up.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,223
It's time to go.

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,437
Come on, sweetie. Emily?

23
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:21,410
Oh, my god.

24
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:25,477
Justin, come upstairs.

25
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:27,508
Emmy!

26
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:28,752
Emily!

27
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:31,039
Em!

28
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,933
Oh, my God!

29
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:36,522
Seven-year-old female admitted
with subdural hematoma.

30
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:39,415
Pappiledema indicates pressure building
for hours, maybe days.

31
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,171
- Cause?
- Blunt trauma.

32
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,936
I ran a skeletal and neural workup

33
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,071
discovered a fractured left femur,
healed approximately six weeks

34
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:50,186
hairline fractures to the ribs,
bruising to the arms and pelvic region.

35
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:52,911
Vaginal trauma indicated sexual abuse,
so we did a rape kit.

36
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,887
- Where is she now?
- Neurosurgery.

37
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,771
- Her chances?
- Too soon to tell.

38
00:01:56,771 --> 00:02:00,765
- Who brought her in?
- Her mother. Jamie McKenna.

39
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,871
- And the father?
- Out of town on business.

40
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:10,045
Oh, great. Eight-car pile-up
on the Triborough.

41
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:12,165
Overflow, five minutes out.
If you need me...

42
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,611
We'll beep you.

43
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:16,648
So, have a nice weekend?

44
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,015
I don't remember having a weekend.

00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:04,616
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/11/10

56
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,254
She was crying when
I picked her up from her father's

57
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:12,737
but she's always upset
after her week with him.

58
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:14,583
She was fine when
I put her to bed. / Wait.

59
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,932
I thought her father was out of town.

60
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,272
No. My husband is out of town.

61
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,532
Her father is part of a time in my life
I'd just as soon forget.

62
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,981
If we didn't share custody,
I'd never want to see him again.

63
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,846
Can we go now?

64
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,863
Justin, please.

65
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:29,117
I got a quiz in trig.

66
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:30,716
We're gonna need to talk to you, too, son.

67
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,533
How long will that be?

68
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,790
As long as it takes.

69
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,850
- Oh, God!
- Where is she?

70
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,555
- You stay away from her!
- I want to see her.

71
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:41,911
- Just take it easy there, pal.
- Who are you?

72
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:43,717
Detective Stabler, who are you?

73
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:44,684
Emily's father.

74
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:45,582
What's your name?
You got one?

75
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,261
Denny Corea.

76
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,560
How could you let this happen?

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,044
I left her alone with you.

78
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:51,519
What do you say we go for a little walk?

79
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,364
I won't let him get away with this.

80
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,325
I won't.

81
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,624
Do you think he did this to Emily?

82
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,625
He's always had a problem with his anger.

83
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:04,198
But ever since I married Randall,
it's gotten worse.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,836
I know Denny hates me,
but why take it out on an innocent child?

85
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:10,801
All afternoon she watched The Lion King.

86
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:13,192
I cooked her a quick dinner
and then her mother picked her up.

87
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,402
- Okay, what time was that?
- About 6:00.

88
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:17,132
It's Jamie's week to have her.

89
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,181
You know, I should have never
let her go back to that house.

90
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:21,313
Yeah, why not?

91
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:24,709
Because he touches her.

92
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:26,736
Okay. Who's that?

93
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:30,014
The animal Jamie married,
Randall McKenna.

94
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:31,626
Your daughter tell you that?

95
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:33,791
She didn't have to.

96
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,220
I saw the bruises.

97
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,045
When I asked her what happened

98
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,686
she just started to cry.

99
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,622
- You report him?
- Of course I reported him.

100
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:45,790
But Jamie told the case worker
that it was me.

101
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,954
Okay. Why would she do that?

102
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,111
Because she wants Emily all to herself.

103
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,569
Even if it means hurting her?

104
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:55,375
Jamie wants what she wants,
no matter who it hurts.

105
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:59,013
It's your basic "he said, she said"
with a twist.

106
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:01,958
Mother blames the father.
Father blames the stepfather.

107
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,481
What do the doctors say?

108
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,332
Abuse is long-term,

109
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:09,005
but the head injury occurred in a 10 to
24-hour window prior to admittance.

110
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,845
Looks like she was molested, too.

111
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,883
Rape kit turned up a hair and
a nylon bristle embedded

112
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:16,561
- in abrasions to her backside.
- From what?

113
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:17,774
Lab's working on it.

114
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,546
If the girl was good
when her mom put her to bed,

115
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,706
- it had to be someone in the house.
- Not necessarily.

116
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,231
The bleeding was internal.

117
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,142
It could have been hours before
the symptoms showed.

118
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:26,653
What do we know about the father?

119
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:29,292
Denny Corea, age 32, Cuban immigrant

120
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,424
did time in '93 for robbery and assault.

121
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:33,686
He's now working as a cook
at the Greenbriar School.

122
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:35,416
The same school Emily attends.

123
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,641
And the husband?

124
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:40,379
Randall McKenna, 40-ish
investment banker with a Wall Street firm.

125
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:43,733
Has one son with Jamie and one son
from a previous marriage.

126
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:47,345
Both boys were home but the younger
one is learning disabled, non-verbal

127
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:50,952
and the older one, Justin,
who's 15, couldn't add much.

128
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:52,257
What about Randall?

129
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:53,787
Still in D.C. On business.

130
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,399
Which brings us back to Desi.

131
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,827
So how's a society chick hook up with
a fry cook in the first place?

132
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:02,113
In rehab. Jamie was kicking
an amphetamine habit and

133
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,262
Denny was teaching
a dance class at the time.

134
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:07,299
Jamie got pregnant and her mother
demanded the clinic fire Denny,

135
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,331
or else she'd have their license revoked.

136
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:11,213
Well, she's got the juice.

137
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,925
Jamie McKenna's mother is Lois Huntington

138
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,178
chair of the Avery Huntington Foundation.

139
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:17,964
Widow of the late ambassador.

140
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:20,257
Benson, Stabler, pay a courtesy call.

141
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:22,392
Get some background
on the custody issue.

142
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:26,356
You two visit ACS, see if
any of the prior charges fit the M.O.

143
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:28,661
That Huntington money
buys a lot of friends,

144
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:33,592
so let's get this moving before those friends
put my number on their speed dialers.

145
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,717
You're saying Denny Corea raped Jamie?

146
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:39,902
I'm saying she was vulnerable and
he took advantage of that vulnerability.

147
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:43,158
But you supported the agreement
that awarded him custody.

148
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:46,010
Jamie was in no condition to
care for a sick infant.

149
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,955
I tried to convince her to abort.

150
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:50,371
The drug abuse, did that start
at an early age?

151
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,778
You make her sound like a common junkie.

152
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,441
They were prescription drugs.
Diet pills.

153
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,883
- So she had a weight problem?
- A discipline problem.

154
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,966
She was an only child,
and her father indulged her.

155
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:03,032
When he died, she indulged herself.

156
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:03,934
Were they close?

157
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:06,138
She was Daddy's little girl.

158
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:08,262
And she took full advantage.

159
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,740
She finally became so incorrigible
I sent her to boarding school.

160
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,262
And how old was she at the time?

161
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:16,090
Eleven. I wish I could say that it helped.

162
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,683
At least the pregnancy brought her
to her senses.

163
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:20,978
She straightened up and
she made a life for herself

164
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:23,034
and she wanted to
share that life with Emily.

165
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:26,735
Did her husband support her decision
to sue for custody?

166
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:29,963
Completely.
And he paid the price.

167
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:31,632
The day after she filed,

168
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:35,698
Denny broke three bones in his face
and threatened to kill him.

169
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,089
What did Randall do?

170
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,605
Against my advice,
he offered Denny a deal.

171
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:44,397
He wouldn't file charges
if Denny would agree to give up the child.

172
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,007
Denny agree?

173
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:48,993
He has until Friday to sign the papers.

174
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:51,591
I actually hope the vile creature refuses

175
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,590
and he gets the full measure of
what he deserves.

176
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,725
Administration for Children's Services
154 William Street
Monday, November 20

177
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:02,382
Our first contact with Emily was
in April of 1994

178
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,187
when the hospital called us in.

179
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:05,479
The baby was very sick,

180
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,556
and since Jamie was struggling
with her own addiction

181
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:09,398
custody was granted to the father.

182
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:10,739
Even though he had a record?

183
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:13,487
A prison record doesn't terminate
parental rights.

184
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:15,710
How did Jamie's mother react
to the arrangement?

185
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,941
Mrs. Huntington was
the driving force behind it.

186
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:21,019
In fact, she used her connections
to push through the paperwork.

187
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:23,095
And when did Jamie start
challenging that arrangement?

188
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,657
About a year ago.

189
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:26,922
That's when the abuse charges surfaced.

190
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:30,792
We investigated, but we couldn't find
sufficient evidence to pursue a case.

191
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,042
Broken bones ain't sufficient enough?

192
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,814
Normal childhood mishaps.

193
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,252
And how would you characterize
this latest "mishap"?

194
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,943
We followed procedure.

195
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,771
And that lets you sleep at night?

196
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,813
I haven't had a good night's sleep
in 10 years.

197
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,853
The Greenbriar School
329 East 66th Street
Monday, November 20

198
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:54,103
Denny works three shifts in the kitchen.

199
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:57,866
And still finds time to join
Emily's class for story time.

200
00:08:57,866 --> 00:09:01,422
He tells such wonderful stories
about his childhood in Cuba.

201
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:04,216
Yet you filed an abuse report with ACS.

202
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:07,144
I'm required by law to report any injury

203
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:09,607
even those that could be attributed
to simple stress

204
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,732
or prepubescent clumsiness.

205
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:14,095
Which of the above caused a broken leg?

206
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,660
Emily said she fell when she was
learning to ride a bicycle

207
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,823
that her father bought her for her birthday.

208
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,679
You don't think she was abused?

209
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,665
I don't think her father was responsible.

210
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:23,633
Why not?

211
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,739
I have known Denny for six years.

212
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:30,014
And, in all that time, I've never even
heard him raise his voice to her.

213
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:34,433
Is there any other adult who had regular
or prolonged contact with her?

214
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:38,821
Henry Abidin. He's the minister for
protocol for the Brunei Mission.

215
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,481
He's a friend of the school.

216
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,953
And he's taken a special interest in Emily.

217
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:43,964
How special?

218
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:48,273
Well, he reads to her, he takes her
to dance class and to the theater.

219
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:51,506
But he loves the child and she loves him.

220
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,791
No offense, Miss Dunlap.

221
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,002
But kids don't always come straight
with their teachers.

222
00:09:55,002 --> 00:10:00,034
Is there anyone else, a friend,
classmate, who she was close to?

223
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,019
Well, there is a little girl named Jennifer.

224
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,083
They're always together,
they're like sisters.

225
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,448
Hi, Jennifer.

226
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:10,257
Hi. / I'm Detective Munch.

227
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,179
That's a funny name. Munch.

228
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,633
You think that's funny?

229
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:18,132
I guess if I ever have kids
I have to call them "munchkins."

230
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:22,517
Could we talk about your friend Emily?

231
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:25,479
It's not nice to talk
behind people's backs.

232
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,912
That's true.

233
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:29,173
But I think it would be okay
just this one time.

234
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:31,692
You know, Emily's hurt and
we're trying to help her.

235
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,574
You want to help her, too, don't you?

236
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:35,440
Yeah. / Good.

237
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,974
She ever talk to you
about her friend Henry?

238
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:42,100
He's nice. He takes her to shows and
buys her toy animals and stuff.

239
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,104
He makes everybody laugh
with his funny songs.

240
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,227
How about her daddy?

241
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:50,765
She said he was mad.

242
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:52,207
How come?

243
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:56,197
Well, her mommy was
trying to take her away.

244
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:59,304
She say anything else
about her daddy?

245
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:03,185
She said they were going on a trip.

246
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:04,968
Where?

247
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,770
It's a secret.

248
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,879
It's okay, we're her friends.

249
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,568
They said they were going to Cuba.

250
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:12,321
That's an island.

251
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,163
Sure is, honey.

252
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,446
I have a Barbie with hair that grows.

253
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,625
- You wanna see it?
- Maybe later.

254
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,643
Fin and I have to help Emily now.

255
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:22,999
But thank you for talking to me.

256
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:24,613
You're welcome.

257
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:27,433
- Can I go now?
- Sure.

258
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:36,102
- I'll check the airlines.
- Good.

259
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:40,403
- Can you move?
- If you get me a forklift.

260
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,382
Denny Corea's looking
like a real hothead.

261
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:47,958
Put Randall McKenna in the hospital
day after Jamie filed for custody.

262
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,728
He's got until Friday to choose between
jail time and signing away his kid.

263
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:52,866
What's the matter with you?

264
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,294
Injured in the line of duty.

265
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:55,720
Yeah, now I'm a pain in my own ass.

266
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,435
But, enough about me.

267
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:00,518
One of Emily's friends told us
about a trip Denny was planning.

268
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:03,313
A buddy in customs checked
the manifest for flights to Cuba

269
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:05,395
and guess what he found?

270
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:10,315
Two tickets in Denny and Emily's name
departing for Cuba via Quebec this Friday.

271
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:11,495
One-way.

272
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:15,491
Well maybe it's time we brought
Mr. Corea in for a little chat.

273
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:22,051
I just wanted to get her away from him.

274
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,675
Children's Services
wouldn't believe me.

275
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,069
I didn't know what else to do.

276
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,830
Well, smacking Randall around
didn't exactly bolster your case.

277
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,431
I wanted to talk to him.
He is a father.

278
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:33,385
I thought I could shame him into
leaving my daughter alone.

279
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,891
By rearranging his face?

280
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:36,771
He pushed me, okay?
It happened so fast.

281
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:38,239
Is that what happened
with the store clerk?

282
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,462
I don't understand.

283
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:41,235
A few years back.
The convenience store?

284
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:43,030
You did time for beating him
to a bloody pulp.

285
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,470
He tried to shoot me.

286
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,960
Because you were robbing his store.

287
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,551
I was hungry. I just defected.

288
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,626
The government says, "Welcome to America,
goodbye and good luck."

289
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:52,850
Denny, that is a very sad story.
But if you're such a victim

290
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,304
why is it that everyone else
winds up getting hurt?

291
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:56,795
You are twisting everything.

292
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:59,578
Like you did with Emily?
You twisted her little leg until it broke?

293
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,709
I would never hurt my daughter.

294
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,826
- I'm sure you never meant to.
- Like you never meant to hurt Randall...

295
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,383
- Or the store clerk.
- Or Jamie.

296
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:09,321
Please! / Denny, now come on.
It's time to come clean here, all right?

297
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,305
For Emily's sake.
It's just time to do the right thing.

298
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:16,242
We wanna help you
but you gotta tell us the truth.

299
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,645
Guys. Got a minute?

300
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,267
What the hell, Captain?
He was about to pop.

301
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,450
I just talked to the lab.
Denny's not our man.

302
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,326
What?

303
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:37,442
Blood type doesn't match
the hair sample from the rape kit.

304
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:42,614
With Denny out of the picture
we need to reassess our profile

305
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,263
so I've asked Dr. Skoda here
to lend us a hand.

306
00:13:46,263 --> 00:13:50,332
This one's tough. The molestation occurred
in such a complex social matrix...

307
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:51,952
English, please.

308
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:54,222
Child abusers are generally adept at

309
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:57,272
manipulating emotions
and shading perceptions.

310
00:13:57,272 --> 00:13:59,428
But in this case,
the abuser had to contend

311
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:02,641
with two separate social and
familial groups

312
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,434
one of which presumably
offered a safe haven.

313
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:08,315
That requires some finely
tuned social radar.

314
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,288
Well, if he's so finely tuned,
why go after a kid?

315
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:14,466
It's not about intimacy.
It's about displaced rage.

316
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:15,719
Rage over what?

317
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:18,731
Sexual inadequacies,
abuse in his childhood.

318
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,778
So someone with low self-esteem.

319
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:21,804
Yeah.

320
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:24,618
But that's where the profile gets tricky.

321
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:28,541
The same insecurities that drive him
to aberrant behavior in one area

322
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,044
can also drive him to excel in another.

323
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:35,091
So, he could be, whatever,
head of a Fortune 500 company.

324
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,611
I guess Randall McKenna
moves to the top of the list.

325
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,292
You said he was out of town.

326
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,587
Yeah. Well, I called his office
to schedule an interview.

327
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:44,850
Found out his plane didn't leave
until 7:00 Monday morning.

328
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,852
Didn't Denny say something about a friend
who took Emily to go see The Lion King?

329
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:51,395
Yeah. Henry Abidin.

330
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:53,787
Minister of protocol for the Brunei Mission.

331
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:56,759
Well, we may run into a diplomatic brick wall

332
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,903
but see if he's willing to talk.

333
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:00,961
I assume your meeting is on the books?

334
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,988
Yeah. Done. Out.

335
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:06,988
Office of Randall McKenna
400 Wall Street
Tuesday, November 21

336
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:10,710
Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but
I have a meeting at 30 Rock in 40 minutes.

337
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,364
Yeah, well, take five, we'll be
out of your hair in no time.

338
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:16,208
I'm sorry. Look, it's been
a hard couple of weeks.

339
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,082
How can I help you?

340
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,631
Just a little history.

341
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,680
You and Jamie have been married
for what, three years?

342
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,566
Yeah. / How'd you two hook up?

343
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:23,837
Her mother was a client.

344
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:25,474
She introduced us at a party.

345
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:28,233
Were you still married to your first wife
at the time? / Separated.

346
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:31,342
So Jamie's pregnancy only
hastened the inevitable.

347
00:15:31,342 --> 00:15:33,621
Michael's four.
We did the math.

348
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:37,187
Is there a point to this conversation?

349
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,076
Where were you Sunday night?

350
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:41,003
I was here, then at home. Why?

351
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:43,524
Spend any quality time
with your stepdaughter?

352
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:44,639
What are you driving at?

353
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,312
Denny Corea says
you've been molesting her.

354
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,457
And you believed him?

355
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:51,819
Look what he did to me.

356
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:55,228
He also said that you tried to blackmail
him into giving up custody.

357
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,457
I offered him an opportunity
to avoid prison.

358
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,526
And to close off any further investigation.

359
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:00,992
Oh, this is nuts.

360
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,976
You had access.

361
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,191
She slept in the next bedroom.

362
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:07,137
I thought Denny was
your primary suspect.

363
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:09,934
Blood analysis excluded him.

364
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:12,344
And now you're scrambling
to cover your ass.

365
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,243
Of course, you could help
expose our better halves

366
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:17,221
by offering up a sample of your own.

367
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:18,394
You've already insulted me.

368
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,884
I'll be damned if I will allow you
to invade my privacy.

369
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:23,560
We'll get a court order to compel you.

370
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:28,523
Well, then, I guess from now on
you'll be talking to my lawyer.

371
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:30,885
Now, if you'll excuse me.

372
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,492
I'm already late for my meeting.

373
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:37,863
Mission of Brunei Darussalam
422 East 64th Street
Tuesday, November 21

374
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,357
Right this way, gentlemen.

375
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:41,787
The minister will be right with you.

376
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:49,931
I got one of those hanging
from a rope in my shower.

377
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:53,179
Only mine's got a spring-fresh scent.

378
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,362
Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen.
Henry Abidin.

379
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:57,870
Odafin Tutuola.

380
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,396
Oh, Tutuola. "The gentle one."

381
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,981
You know Yoruban?

382
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:04,217
In my business, one tends to
know a little about a lot.

383
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:07,628
John Munch. Romanian,
"the handsome one."

384
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:10,282
I assume your visit concerns poor Emily.

385
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:11,349
Yes, it does.

386
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,687
Her grandmother told me.

387
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:13,929
You know Lois Huntington?

388
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,809
No, we met while Avery was still alive.

389
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,534
In fact, it was she who first suggested

390
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:19,704
The Greenbriar School might be
a potential beneficiary

391
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,769
of the royal family's charitable interests.

392
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,240
Were you aware that her granddaughter
was a student there?

393
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,059
Yes.

394
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,893
But the fact that Emily proved to be such
a delight was an unexpected bonus.

395
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:30,889
You took her to a show on Sunday.

396
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:33,010
The matinee of The Lion King.

397
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,624
Where did you go after that?

398
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:36,135
I brought her home to her father.

399
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,576
I don't suppose you have anyone
to corroborate

400
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,881
your whereabouts between
the show and home.

401
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:40,837
As a matter of fact,

402
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:43,859
her grandmother joined us
at the theatre and my driver drove us.

403
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,447
Grandma's a regular on these field trips?

404
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:47,734
She is.

405
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,821
Emily's father's in sync with that?

406
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:52,098
Considering the animosity
between him and Lois

407
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:54,492
we felt it best he not know.

408
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:57,103
Any other secrets you wanna tell us?

409
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:00,836
Gentlemen, I know
it's your job to be suspicious.

410
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:04,489
But that little girl won my heart with
her joyful spirit.

411
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:07,424
And I'll do whatever I can to see
to it the person responsible

412
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:11,585
for dimming that spirit goes to jail
for a very long time.

413
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,199
- What, more questions?
- Yep.

414
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,617
What time did your dad leave for
the airport on Monday morning?

415
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:19,240
I don't know, I was asleep.

416
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,729
Okay, can you tell us what time
he came home the night before?

417
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:23,519
I don't know, I was asleep.

418
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,857
Hear any noises during the night?

419
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:26,469
Just him and Jamie arguing.

420
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:27,915
Yeah? Over what?
What else?

421
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:28,946
Emily.

422
00:18:28,946 --> 00:18:29,885
Why?

423
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:32,504
I don't know. I put my headset on
so I didn't have to listen.

424
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:33,760
They argue a lot?

425
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,158
All the time. It's why
he never comes home anymore.

426
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,705
Hey, Justin!

427
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,221
We done?

428
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,826
For now. Yeah.

429
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:45,451
So, what have we got?

430
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,503
Henry Abidin waived his diplomatic status

431
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,995
and agreed to submit
a blood sample for analysis.

432
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,514
And Randall McKenna?

433
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:53,255
Heard from his lawyer.
He's fighting.

434
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:55,269
Odd choice for a loving stepfather.

435
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,178
Family's like a jigsaw puzzle.
Nobody gives you the whole picture.

436
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,724
Well, let's look at the pieces we've got.

437
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:04,070
One suspect eliminated, one cooperating
and one hiding behind his lawyer.

438
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,645
Picture's getting clearer.

439
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,241
What's the status on the court order?

440
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:09,547
Cabot's meeting with
Judge Petrovsky in the morning.

441
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:12,340
- And the little girl?
- Still in a coma.

442
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,377
Well, let's all say a prayer this
doesn't turn into a murder case.

443
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:16,585
Sad as it sounds,

444
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:20,455
she's probably safer in that hospital bed
than she's ever been in her own.

445
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:27,898
Hospital X-ray tech, report to 5 East.

446
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:07,029
Chambers of Judge Lena Petrovsky
Wednesday, November 22

447
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:08,392
Investigating officers believe

448
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:11,963
the head trauma is an extension
of an ongoing pattern of abuse.

449
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:15,900
Blood analysis has excluded her father
and Mr. Abidin from the suspect pool

450
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,207
leaving only Mr. McKenna
with access and opportunity.

451
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:21,861
There is not a shred of solid evidence
linking my client to the crime.

452
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:24,674
Mr. McKenna refuses to submit
a sample for analysis.

453
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:27,034
They haven't established
exclusive opportunity.

454
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:29,581
We can provide a detailed timeline
of Emily's whereabouts

455
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:32,994
during the 24 hours prior to
her admission into the hospital.

456
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:35,958
Mr. McKenna has
a clear window of access.

457
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,925
Can your client account for
his whereabouts during this window?

458
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:41,060
He was home, your Honor,
with his family.

459
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,208
Not to be redundant,
but that's precisely our point.

460
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,307
A point well-taken.

461
00:20:46,307 --> 00:20:48,943
I hereby order your client
to present himself

462
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:52,790
to the medical examiner
by 10:00 a.m. Tomorrow, Mr. Woodrow

463
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,458
or he will find himself in contempt.

464
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,299
Hey, Alex.

465
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,374
We heard that Randall McKenna didn't
bother to show up to his own hearing.

466
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:02,828
Why should he? His lawyer's already
on his way to appeal the ruling.

467
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:03,808
Did he have grounds?

468
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:06,585
No, but Woodrow's got to blow
some smoke to earn his retainer.

469
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:08,406
End of the day, I'm sure we'll prevail.

470
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:10,735
Olivia, I want you to put a tag
on Mr. McKenna.

471
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:14,088
If he is one minute late to the M.E
I want him arrested for contempt.

472
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:16,931
Yeah. Thanks, John.
There's no need for that tag.

473
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:21,446
Randall McKenna is in critical condition
at Mercy General.

474
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,271
- What happened?
- According to Munch...

475
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:27,463
cerebral hemorrhage due to
blunt force trauma.

476
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:29,642
Somebody beat the hell out of him.

477
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:34,311
Apartment of Denny Corea
860 West 118th Street
Wednesday, November 22

478
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:37,326
I haven't seen Denny since yesterday.

479
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:39,686
He's usually working

480
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:43,617
or looking after that sweet little girl of his.

481
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:46,394
Did he seem upset or agitated
when you saw him?

482
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:47,719
Huh?

483
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,364
Did he seem upset?

484
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:52,395
You don't have to shout.

485
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,682
He was worried about his daughter.

486
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:03,946
He said her mother married a bad man.

487
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:05,645
Is Denny in trouble?

488
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:08,497
That's what we're trying
to find out, Mrs. Fergus.

489
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:32,098
Yeah?

490
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:39,347
That was Benson.

491
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:43,392
They picked up Denny trying to sneak
into the hospital to see his daughter.

492
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:46,090
Hope he said his goodbyes.

493
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,773
A bloody T-shirt and a witness who
puts you at the scene.

494
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:55,281
Not to mention a set of knuckles
looks like you've been shadow boxing
with a concrete wall.

495
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:58,397
We can wait for Randall
to regain consciousness

496
00:22:58,397 --> 00:23:02,424
but we thought you might want us
to hear your side of the story first.

497
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:06,232
I didn't mean to hurt him.

498
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,917
Okay. Go on.

499
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:12,411
Friday's the deadline...

500
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:16,692
he set for signing the custody papers.

501
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:22,872
I couldn't hand my daughter over...

502
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:26,503
to the man who was molesting her.

503
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:32,096
Jamie said I broke the deal...

504
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:34,146
and Randall was pressing charges.

505
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,597
- For the assault.
- Yes.

506
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:41,412
I went to his office to see if we can talk.

507
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:44,985
But the guard stopped me at the lobby.

508
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:49,015
So I waited for him by the car.

509
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:50,855
For how long?

510
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:56,104
He didn't come out till almost midnight.

511
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,512
When he saw me...

512
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,908
he started yelling...

513
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,802
saying that if I didn't leave him alone...

514
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:07,323
he was gonna charge me
with harassment.

515
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:09,400
What did you do?

516
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,847
I begged him not to do this.

517
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:18,696
I mean, with my record, you know,
I could be deported.

518
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:21,115
So, he listen?

519
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:24,853
He laughed.

520
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:28,114
He said that Jamie's mother...

521
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:31,090
knew people at the State Department.

522
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,210
That I was already as good as gone.

523
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,429
And then what?

524
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:40,417
Next thing I know...

525
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:45,804
I was on top of him...

526
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:49,589
hitting him again and again...

527
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:54,448
until I realized that...

528
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:58,062
he wasn't moving anymore.

529
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:04,189
I found a pay phone, I called 911.

530
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:06,382
I went home.

531
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:12,957
And I changed my clothes.

532
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,445
I wanted to see my daughter
just one more time, you know?

533
00:25:23,445 --> 00:25:28,222
Before I turned myself in.

534
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:32,666
So.

535
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,951
What happens now?

536
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,779
It's hard to say.

537
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,303
You did a real number on him, Denny.

538
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:46,680
No worse than what he did to my baby.

539
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,612
He should have
let the system work for him.

540
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:52,349
His experience with the system hasn't
exactly been encouraging.

541
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:54,143
Hardly an excuse.

542
00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:56,160
I'm just saying,
"What if it was your kid?"

543
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,919
Okay. Thanks.
That was the lab.

544
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,644
We got a make on the nylon bristle.

545
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:04,369
Traced it to a plant in Akron
that manufactures hairbrushes.

546
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:07,067
So that hair sample in the rape kit
came from a brush?

547
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,793
And it doesn't belong to Randall.

548
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,688
DNA doesn't match.

549
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:12,610
Denny stomped the wrong guy.

550
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,316
He was in the right neighborhood.

551
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:18,153
Preliminary analysis tagged someone
in Randall's bloodline.

552
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:20,545
McKenna Residence
660 West 84th Street
Wednesday, November 22

553
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,305
I don't understand.

554
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:25,018
I know. I'm sorry, Jamie
but these detectives have a job to do.

555
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:27,407
But we're the victims here.
My husband, my daughter.

556
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:29,808
- Haven't we suffered enough?
- Yes, and I know it's hard.

557
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:32,603
But why don't we just go downstairs
for a minute. Okay?

558
00:27:13,354 --> 00:27:16,458
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
That's mine.

559
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:18,995
None of this would be happening

560
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,472
if that bitch hadn't sucked my dad
into her crappy life.

561
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,712
That go for Emily, too?

562
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:24,087
All she does is cry.

563
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:26,649
- I bet that gets on your nerves?
- Damn straight.

564
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:28,911
- That why you let her have it?
- Have what?

565
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:30,709
Come on, Justin, we know you hurt her.

566
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:31,779
I didn't touch her.

567
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:34,085
- Well, then, who did?
- I don't know. Maybe she did.

568
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,848
- Who is she?
- The bitch.

569
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:36,949
With your hairbrush?

570
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,446
All I know is, everything was fine
until she showed up.

571
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:40,668
Now it all sucks.

572
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:43,942
Why can't they both just go away
and leave us alone?

573
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,984
Sometimes I'd come home to find her
in her room crying,

574
00:27:46,984 --> 00:27:50,615
and Justin just standing there watching.

575
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:52,885
I knew he resented the attention
Randall gave her

576
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:56,375
but I never dreamed he was hurting her.

577
00:27:56,375 --> 00:28:00,522
He said that you and Randall
argued about her.

578
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:04,864
If we argued at all, it was about
Justin's attitude toward Emily.

579
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:09,445
Was Justin alone with her the night
she was injured?

580
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:11,337
After I put Emily to bed,

581
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:15,820
I took Michael to the drug store
to refill his asthma medication.

582
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,517
The line was so long,
it took us an hour to get home.

583
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:22,169
And where was your husband?

584
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:26,718
At the office.
He didn't come home until late.

585
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,080
I looked in on her before I went to bed.

586
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,780
She looked so peaceful.

587
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:36,728
I thought she was sleeping.

588
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:43,340
How could I be so blind?

589
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:48,225
The lab scored a direct DNA
hit with the hair from Justin's brush.

590
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,983
Could explain why his father
didn't want to give a sample.

591
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:52,080
Why? Do you think he knew?

592
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,777
Might have suspected.

593
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,543
Where are we with the boy?

594
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:58,250
He's one angry kid,
but he isn't ready to give it up.

595
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,146
What do you say we toss him
in a cell for a while

596
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:03,239
see if that doesn't take the edge off?

597
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,205
Are you sure
there's nothing else I can do?

598
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:13,984
I can write out my statement,
if you'd like.

599
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:15,781
No, that's all right.
We've got it all on tape

600
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:18,378
and we can take care of
the paperwork in the morning.

601
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:19,933
Okay. Thank you.

602
00:29:21,735 --> 00:29:23,899
- Good night.
- Good night.

603
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,589
She seems almost disappointed.

604
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:32,431
Her husband may never walk,
her daughter's in a coma

605
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:35,414
her stepson is going to jail...

606
00:29:35,414 --> 00:29:37,831
and her ex-boyfriend's facing deportation.

607
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:41,637
She's not disappointed, Munch.
She's numb.

608
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,564
You don't look convinced.

609
00:29:45,564 --> 00:29:47,198
It's the small things.
For example,

610
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:49,434
if Emily had been showing
abuse symptoms for months

611
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:51,979
how come we haven't turned up
a single hospital record?

612
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:53,775
Then there's this.

613
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:57,217
It's an interesting idea for a key chain.

614
00:29:57,217 --> 00:30:00,315
- Found it in Emily's room.
- Who's Erica Smith?

615
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:03,542
Nobody at Emily's school or
dance class has any idea.

616
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,034
Think there's something to it?

617
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:06,917
One way to find out.

618
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:11,495
Hudson Free Clinic
107 West 97th Street
Thursday, November 23

619
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,688
There it is, Erica Smith,

620
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:16,338
admitted on May 20th
complaining of vaginal bleeding.

621
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:18,399
A day before the school filed
its abuse report.

622
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,560
The attending prescribed an antibacterial
ointment and the girl was sent home.

623
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,209
Didn't anyone here suspect abuse?

624
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:26,763
The ACS was notified, but we never heard
from the mother or the agency again.

625
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:29,111
- You got a home address?
- Yeah. Right there.

626
00:30:30,115 --> 00:30:32,877
If that's her address, she's living
in the middle of the East River.

627
00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:35,614
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- We've been had.

628
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,526
We checked the X-rays and blood type
from the medical records

629
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,724
against Emily's,
and they're one and the same.

630
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:47,976
We also found matches at four
separate clinics and hospitals.

631
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:50,838
In each case, she used
a different alias and paid in cash

632
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:52,352
so there'd be no paper trail.

633
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,049
She could have been covering
for her husband. / Or Justin.

634
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,256
We've been assuming the attacker
is male because of the sexual abuse.

635
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,306
But suppose it was Jamie all along.

636
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:02,955
It's possible these injuries
aren't even sexual.

637
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:04,509
It's an interesting tactic.

638
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:06,755
Abuse the kid, pin it on the ex...

639
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:09,432
Dad goes to jail, Mom wins
custody by default.

640
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:12,095
And if her daughter dies in the process?

641
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:13,351
Bonus.

642
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:14,339
Excuse me?

643
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,275
The kid is nothing more than
a means to an end.

644
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:17,475
Which is?

645
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,606
Attention.

646
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:19,977
Sympathy.

647
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:21,192
Love.

648
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:22,799
People who've suffered abuse
in childhood

649
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,163
tend to repeat the pattern
with their own children.

650
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:27,293
This is an extreme case
because of the rage.

651
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:32,148
But, in the end, she's just wrapping herself
in the warm cloak of victimhood.

652
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:35,304
Yeah, but if she's looking for sympathy,
why use the aliases?

653
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:36,970
To control the outcome.

654
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,251
Rape kit analysis would have
excluded Denny from the get-go.

655
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:42,198
Leaving her without a scapegoat.

656
00:31:42,198 --> 00:31:44,263
Till Justin showed up.

657
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:46,488
Justin, we know this is a pain
in the ass for you.

658
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,953
Just meet us halfway,
maybe we can help you out.

659
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:50,018
Whatever.

660
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:52,002
You said that you didn't
hurt your stepsister.

661
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:53,980
- I didn't.
- But your stepmother said...

662
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,616
that you were the only one that
was alone with her that night.

663
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:57,973
Yeah, for about two minutes.

664
00:31:57,973 --> 00:31:59,983
But Jamie said
she was gone for an hour.

665
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,010
Maybe she was.

666
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,953
All right, that's enough.
Enough. Sit down.

667
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,090
Very clearly,

668
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,259
we are trying to get you out of here.

669
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:14,785
You understand that?
Now, you keep talking in circles,

670
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:18,191
you're gonna be spending
your varsity years behind bars.

671
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:19,929
Look, I don't know
how long she was gone.

672
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:22,404
All I know is, once she was out the door,
I took off.

673
00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:23,966
Where did you go?

674
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:25,974
I was bored as hell,
so I went for a run in the park.

675
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:27,120
Okay. Where?

676
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,733
Down the ice rink over
the baseball diamonds, and back.

677
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:30,988
Anybody see you?

678
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:33,420
I'm sure they did,
but I didn't take names.

679
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,052
How long were you gone?

680
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:36,848
I don't know. An hour.

681
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,677
Was your stepmother there
when you got home?

682
00:32:38,677 --> 00:32:40,709
Chewed me out for leaving that brat alone.

683
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,902
I mean, the kid was asleep.
What difference did it make?

684
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:47,338
If he's telling the truth Jamie could have
hurt the girl before he got home.

685
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,292
Without proof,
it's just more finger-pointing.

686
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:51,138
We need corroborating testimony.

687
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,443
Too bad our only other witnesses
are either mute or in a coma.

688
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:57,533
What about the druggist?
Jamie said that she went to fill a prescription.

689
00:32:57,533 --> 00:33:00,079
She didn't give a name,
but if the kid's got a chronic condition

690
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,936
maybe she has an account
in the neighborhood.

691
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:04,407
Well, that's a start.
But we need someone closer to home.

692
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,249
Well, the neighbors were not helpful.

693
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:09,845
What about that nosey doorman that jacked
us when we served the search warrant?

694
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:13,578
He said that he didn't see anything
out of the ordinary.

695
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,481
Maybe you didn't ask the right questions.

696
00:33:18,221 --> 00:33:20,731
First the little girl, then her husband.

697
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:22,335
My heart goes out to her.

698
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:25,699
Do you remember seeing Jamie heading
out with her four-year-old on Sunday night?

699
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,472
Come to think of it
kid was breathing heavy.

700
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:29,821
He's got asthma, you know.

701
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:33,016
I offered to flag a cab, but she said
they were just going down the block.

702
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:34,153
How about the older boy?

703
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:35,305
Justin? / Yeah.

704
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,942
That one's got an attitude.

705
00:33:36,942 --> 00:33:39,854
Came storming out right after Jamie
toward the park.

706
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:42,537
Told him it ain't safe for a kid after dark
but would he listen?

707
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:43,777
You got a time?

708
00:33:43,777 --> 00:33:47,100
Around 9:00. I was just
about to take my break.

709
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:49,764
And do you remember
what time Jamie got back?

710
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:50,783
Didn't see her.

711
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:52,979
But she could've walked in
while I was taking a powder.

712
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:54,752
Excuse me.
Where's Fin?

713
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:57,435
- We split up to cover more ground.
- You find the drugstore?

714
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,112
Pharmacist checked Jamie's receipt.

715
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:02,025
It was time-coded 9:09 p.m.,
after closing.

716
00:34:02,025 --> 00:34:04,107
But she called and made
such a stink that he waited for her.

717
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:06,011
He said she was in and out
in five minutes.

718
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,797
How far a walk?

719
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,716
Five minutes.
Ten minutes with a kid in tow.

720
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,340
That puts her back here 9:20, 9:30.

721
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,622
What you learn from the doorman?

722
00:34:13,622 --> 00:34:16,876
Couldn't place Jamie, but remembers
Justin getting back after 10:00.

723
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:19,560
Plenty of time to do serious damage.

724
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:21,523
You're circling the building

725
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:24,641
but unless you place her in the apartment
at the time of the assault

726
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:25,880
you don't have a case.

727
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,789
What about the hospital fraud?

728
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:29,718
Well, it's not fraud if she paid the bills.

729
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:31,637
Consciousness of guilt?

730
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,909
Even if you can prove Jamie was the one
who took Emily to those facilities,

731
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,096
you can't bootstrap
aggravated child abuse

732
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:39,993
to her conduct without
a more definitive causal link.

733
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:43,601
You remember how Skoda said
Jamie has this need for attention?

734
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:45,167
Well, I gave her my pager number

735
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,984
in case she needed somebody to talk to...

736
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,740
and guess who's been paging me?

737
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,273
She's feeling needy.

738
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:53,005
If Skoda's right,
it's more than need.

739
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:55,432
I think she's jonesing for a sympathy fix.

740
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:57,507
And what do you propose?

741
00:34:57,507 --> 00:34:59,221
Feed the junkie.

742
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:04,901
Thanks for coming down.

743
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,406
I just want to help in whatever way I can.

744
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:13,490
As you know, we're holding Justin
until he can be arraigned...

745
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:17,123
and then we'll release him
into your custody...

746
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:20,022
assuming you want to take him.

747
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:21,982
I don't know.

748
00:35:21,982 --> 00:35:26,193
He scares me. I'm sure he just hurt
Emily to get back at me.

749
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:29,756
Must be hard to be an outcast
in your own house.

750
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:31,295
You don't know the half of it.

751
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,993
Actually, I do.

752
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:43,354
This is my file.

753
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:46,393
I thought it was sealed.

754
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:49,324
I have a friend in Children's Services.

755
00:35:49,324 --> 00:35:50,786
She remembered you.

756
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:52,503
How?

757
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:57,418
She remembered how nervous her superiors
were about investigating an ambassador

758
00:35:57,418 --> 00:36:01,617
for sexually abusing his
11-year-old daughter.

759
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,781
It must have been
a very painful time for you.

760
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:07,245
Yes, it was.

761
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:09,528
How did your mother take it?

762
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:15,430
She was jealous, because
Daddy couldn't stand to touch her.

763
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:20,180
So she sent me away to boarding school.
I begged her not to but

764
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,503
what Mother wants, Mother gets.

765
00:36:24,503 --> 00:36:27,108
She abandoned you, Jamie.

766
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,737
I survived.

767
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:34,564
But still. Must be hard facing that kind
of rejection from your own daughter.

768
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:36,904
What do you mean?

769
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:40,279
Emily came out of her coma
a few hours ago.

770
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:43,035
She told us everything.

771
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,591
She wants to see you.

772
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:51,675
But first you and I have a couple of details
we need to straighten out.

773
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:55,432
What details?

774
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:59,548
- Let's start with the hairbrush.
- It's Justin's.

775
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:02,443
Yes, but we got a partial print...

776
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:05,942
- and with Emily's testimony...
- Emily's a liar.

777
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:11,778
- Now why would she lie?
- Her father poisoned her against me.

778
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:17,463
It's been very painful, very hurtful.

779
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:21,124
I know, Jamie.

780
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,712
Been carrying the pain long enough.

781
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,981
Just tell me your side of the story

782
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:30,955
and you can start to heal.

783
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:42,673
We were driving home and
she wouldn't stop crying

784
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:48,416
so I pulled over to try and talk to her.

785
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:54,248
But when she told me she and her daddy
were leaving me forever...

786
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:58,666
I pulled her out of the car and
she hit her head on the curb.

787
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:01,262
- How?
- She fell.

788
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:02,957
Come on, Jamie.

789
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:09,821
I didn't shove her hard.

790
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,427
I just wanted her to stop whining...

791
00:38:12,427 --> 00:38:14,059
so I could talk to her.

792
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,400
Did that stop her?

793
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,159
It was the first time
she was quiet all day.

794
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,277
And she was sleepy.

795
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:29,923
So when I got home, I put her to bed and
Michael and I went to the drugstore.

796
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,274
But when we came back...

797
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:37,864
she was crying again.

798
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:39,697
I told her...

799
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:43,664
how important it was for her
to be a good girl...

800
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:48,099
so that her new daddy could love her,
too, but she wouldn't stop.

801
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,135
It was like she was doing it to spite me.

802
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:53,935
Is that why you used the hairbrush?

803
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:55,592
I had to teach her discipline.

804
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:58,040
My mother used a hairbrush to teach me

805
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,458
but Emily just kept screaming louder and
louder, what was I supposed to do?

806
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:06,395
The only thing you could do.

807
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:15,110
I threw her against the wall.

808
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:17,716
Then what?

809
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:24,413
She finally stopped.

810
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,245
And then I tucked her into bed
kissed her on her cheek,

811
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:36,170
and then I told her I loved her.

812
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:43,915
I just wanted her to stop crying.

813
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:49,147
Was that too much to ask?

814
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:13,689
It's good work, John.

815
00:40:32,627 --> 00:40:37,193
Took a chance with that bluff about Emily
coming out of her coma.

816
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:42,034
I'm not sure what we would have done
if Jamie had pressed to see her.

817
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,595
She didn't care about the kids.

818
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,232
How did you know?

819
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,969
We searched her house...

820
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:56,821
I looked at that four-year-old...

821
00:40:57,013 --> 00:40:59,800
flashed on a little girl that used to live
across the street from us

822
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,183
in our old neighborhood
on the Lower East Side.

823
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:06,167
She had that same look in her eyes.

824
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,280
What look?

825
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,468
Sad, lost.

826
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:19,289
She used to stand on her porch every
afternoon when I came home from school.

827
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,805
Like she was waiting for me.

828
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:27,326
Sometimes, she'd have
a black eye or a bloody lip.

829
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,577
Never said anything to me.

830
00:41:30,577 --> 00:41:33,949
Just looked at me like
she was trying to tell me something.

831
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:38,825
But I was too full of my own teenage crap
to pay any attention.

832
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:42,346
One day, I came home...

833
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,560
she wasn't there.

834
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:52,050
Found out her mother threw her through
a plate glass window.

835
00:41:53,994 --> 00:41:56,822
Went to the funeral.

836
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,922
Saw her dad.

837
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:04,897
It's the first time I saw a grown man cry.

838
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,037
What happened to her mother?

839
00:42:09,037 --> 00:42:12,004
They sent her to a sanitarium.

840
00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:13,544
She told my mother...

841
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:16,024
she didn't understand what
all the fuss was about.

842
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:19,930
She was the one that had to
get a new window.

843
00:42:26,817 --> 00:42:30,014
Months later, I'd come home...

844
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:35,000
and I'd look up at the porch.

845
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:40,872
I swear, I saw that little girl standing there,
looking at me with that look.

846
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:49,814
I almost let her down again.

847
00:43:16,535 --> 00:43:19,028
