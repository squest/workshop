1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,866
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,936 --> 00:00:03,565
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:04,833
In New York City,

4
00:00:04,907 --> 00:00:07,808
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:11,404
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:13,449
These are their stories,

7
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:17,816
DOCTOR: Mandibular
and orbital fractures.

8
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:21,050
BIunt-force trauma
to the back of the head
and Ioss of consciousness.

9
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:23,922
Five-centimeter
knife Iaceration
below the right clavicle.

10
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:25,961
He wanted to disfigure her.
And kill her.

11
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,520
DOCTOR: Nearly succeeded, too.
I'm surprised she survived.

12
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:31,226
Radio car found her outside
a warehouse in Chinatown.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,665
Responding to a burglar alarm.

14
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:33,861
DOCTOR: Lucky for her.

15
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:35,096
Yeah, Iucky.

16
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:36,399
What else?

17
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:39,270
Distinct fingerprint bruising
above her knees, and these.

18
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:41,503
Burns,
Iikely from a cigarette.

19
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:44,512
Maybe abuse,
but it's a strange pattern.

20
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,740
This might interest you.

21
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:49,548
Maybe a gang member.

22
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:50,643
BENSON: Rape kit?

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,554
PIenty of fluids, all tainted.
Used some kind of
cleaning solution.

24
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:57,752
Smelled Iike bleach.
She'II be out of it
for a while.

25
00:00:57,827 --> 00:00:59,089
You won't get anything
tonight.

26
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:00,720
Okay. Thanks.

27
00:01:00,797 --> 00:01:03,891
She's gonna
have plates in her face
for the rest of her Iife.

28
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:05,490
A Iot of rage.

29
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,398
BIeach. Guy's meticulous.

30
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:09,768
And confident.

31
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,771
Squad guys took these.

32
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:15,274
AIIey where they found her,
full view of the street.

33
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:18,977
So we got a burglary
and a rape in close proximity.

34
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:20,677
Maybe a dump job.

35
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,547
You believe in coincidences?

36
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:14,027
According to Robbery,
the perps broke into
the warehouse

37
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:17,470
and made out with 50 grand
in these, high-speed
computer processors.

38
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,873
Five masked men, they jumped
the janitor and Iocked him
in the utility closet.

39
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:22,137
This is the only exit.

40
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:24,441
Leading to our second
crime scene.

41
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:28,473
STABLER: Victim is Helen Chen,
19. She Iives a few blocks
down on Hester.

42
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:30,985
This is where the uniform
found her.

43
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:33,817
Among a whole bunch of
computer parts, probably
dropped on the way out.

44
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,221
Burglary alarm was silent.

45
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,021
By the time the patrol car
got here, she was
the only one here.

46
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:41,029
You got five guys in
the warehouse. Maybe a sixth
out here to commit the rape.

47
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:42,462
Or we're talking two crimes.

48
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:45,160
Either way, robbery perps
had to see her on the way out.

49
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:48,328
Our best Iead is a possible
gang tattoo on her shoulder.

50
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:51,201
Women aren't members
of Asian gangs.

51
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:53,538
They're associates
through a brother
or boyfriend.

52
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,304
They use them
to carry drugs and guns.

53
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:56,845
Women are Iess Iikely
to get hassled by cops.

54
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:58,710
Well, so far our only witness
is the victim.

55
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:00,908
We'II hit the hospital,
see what she has to say.

56
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,712
The body art suggests
she associates

57
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,253
with some of the more unsavory
elements in society.

58
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,189
I got a guy down in
Gang Intel. He's probably
seen every tat in town.

59
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:17,565
Tattoos, cigarette burns,
all could indicate
Chinese gang activity,

60
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:19,999
but they signify
different things.

61
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,904
The burns could mean
initiation, number of kills,
punishment.

62
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,868
What's this mean?

63
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:30,078
Could be Chinese gang.

64
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:31,443
Define "could be."

65
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:34,642
Well, a Iot of Chinese gang
tattoos use versions of snakes
or dragons,

66
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,309
but I haven't seen
this one before.

67
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:38,910
For gang intelligence,
you don't have many answers.

68
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:42,014
Look, I worked two years
in Chinatown undercover.

69
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,025
I barely scratched
the surface.

70
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:46,789
You think you'II get somewhere
with a rape investigation?

71
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,727
Chinatown's got no Iove
for cops.

72
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:50,561
Well, they're just gonna
have to get over that.

73
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:53,101
What's your take
on the warehouse robbery?

74
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,967
Computer parts heist
does sound Iike Asian gang
activity.

75
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:58,871
We've been building cases
against several gangs
of high-tech crime.

76
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:02,001
Same profit margin
as drug trafficking,
nowhere near the jail time.

77
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:04,478
Only question is,
where does this rape fit in?

78
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:07,414
A Iot of Asian gangs use rape
as a form of punishment.

79
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,917
Maybe your victim
broke the rules.

80
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,078
Helen, we're trying to
find out who did this to you.

81
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:15,646
So, when you're able,
we'd Iike to talk to
you about it.

82
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:16,817
Don't make her cry.

83
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:19,326
She starts to choke
and they have to snap
her jaw open again.

84
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,420
I told you, she can't talk.

85
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:24,591
Yeah, but you can, Johnny.
Come here. Come here.

86
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:31,105
Okay. What was your sister
doing in that alley?

87
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:32,162
(GRUNTING)

88
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,334
I don't know. Walking home.

89
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:37,911
What happened to your arm?
I burned it.

90
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,949
Yeah, with a Iaser
to remove a gang tattoo.

91
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:42,006
I'm not in a group.

92
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:44,678
So it's just Helen?
She rob the warehouse?

93
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:50,556
I used to be with a group.
Ghost Shadows.
But I got out a Iong time ago.

94
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:51,854
What about your sister?

95
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:54,794
She's still in,
with her yue nan boyfriend.

96
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:56,798
And what's that?
What's yue nan?

97
00:04:56,866 --> 00:05:00,825
Vietnamese. Dao Tran.
He's the one banging.

98
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,334
Last week, I told him
to stay away from Helen.

99
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:06,466
Punk said he'd kill me
if I got in between them.

100
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:09,443
She thinks she can
protect him. Not anymore.

101
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,580
I should've made sure
he stayed away from her
permanently.

102
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:14,275
Dao Tran's boys
hit that warehouse.

103
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,183
Well, how do you know
if you're out? Maybe it was
one of your old friends.

104
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:20,017
Try this on. It was your boys
who robbed the warehouse,

105
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:22,887
and then they rape the sister
of the guy
who turns his back on them.

106
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,188
Ghost Shadows didn't do this.

107
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,524
They know I'd kill anybody
who tried to hurt her.

108
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:30,462
(HELEN GRUNTING)

109
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,399
So where can we find
this Dao Tran?

110
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,700
Pho Hoa Restaurant on Canal.
AII the Born to Kill boys
hang there.

111
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:40,973
Born to Kill?

112
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,635
Yeah. From Vietnam War.

113
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:46,804
It's what the American
soldiers used to write
on their helmets.

114
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:49,744
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

115
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,480
HOSTESS: We closed now.
Come back Iater.

116
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:53,681
BENSON: Where's Dao Tran?
Not here.

117
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,481
Good afternoon, boys.

118
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:57,856
Kind of early to be out
of school. What, you all sick?

119
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,758
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:01,424
Let's take their temperature.

121
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:02,486
No trouble now.

122
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,294
You're closed, we heard.

123
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,195
Hey, wait.

124
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,497
Hey!

125
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:18,408
See how messy things can get
when you don't cooperate, Dao?

126
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:24,743
How's your Iove Iife, Dao?

127
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:27,689
I hear you and Helen Chen
have been dating.

128
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:29,054
We broke up.

129
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,390
Why? She doesn't Iike
being burned with cigarettes?

130
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:34,658
I don't know
what you're talking about.

131
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,198
Kind of Iike you don't know
Helen's in the hospital?

132
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,460
What happened?

133
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:42,061
STABLER:
She was raped and beaten
and Ieft in an alley for dead.

134
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:43,400
God, no.

135
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:45,269
Why don't we stop
with the performance, Dao?

136
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,605
I swear. We haven't
seen each other for a week.

137
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,945
We wanted people to think
we weren't together anymore.

138
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:52,173
People? Like your boys
in Born to Kill?

139
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:53,772
Now we know
her brother's in a gang.

140
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,285
Maybe your boys didn't Iike
you dating a Chinese girl.

141
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:01,148
They jumped her
to teach you a Iesson?
No.

142
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:03,350
Or maybe it had nothing
to do with them.

143
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,553
Johnny Chen said that you're
not good enough for Helen.

144
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:07,255
He embarrassed you,
made you feel stupid.

145
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,321
But you're not stupid.
You're a smart guy, right?

146
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,629
You raped her
while your friends
robbed the warehouse.

147
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:16,330
I didn't rape Helen.
I Iove her.

148
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,371
Ghost Shadows
did the warehouse.

149
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:24,970
BENSON: How do you know?

150
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:26,671
Helen told me.

151
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:29,381
She was their Iookout.

152
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:31,849
I tried to stop her.

153
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,149
Johnny did this.

154
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:40,592
So you want us to believe
that her own brother
raped her.

155
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,426
He ordered it.
Prove it.

156
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:47,094
Look, Helen didn't want to
bang with him, but he's got
this control over her.

157
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:49,137
I mean, you know those
burn marks on her arm?

158
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:52,333
Well, Johnny made her
do that to herself,
because of me.

159
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:55,371
Johnny did this.

160
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:56,502
Okay.

161
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,642
Well, it's still
your word against his.

162
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,845
Ask Helen.
She knows what he can do.

163
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:11,324
STABLER: Helen,
we can't help you if you're
protecting your brother.

164
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:13,452
Now, we know he's involved
in your attack.

165
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:14,757
That's not true.

166
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,491
BENSON: Well,
then tell us what is.

167
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:19,466
'Cause right now
our best suspect is Dao Tran.

168
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:21,526
No, it's not Dao. He Ioves me.

169
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,538
STABLER: Well, your brother
made you burn your arm.

170
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,733
You think he cares
what happens to you?

171
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,702
Did you see him?

172
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,575
I don't remember.

173
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:38,952
I got hit. Passed out.

174
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:43,283
Johnny must have seen you
when he robbed that warehouse.

175
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:46,192
He was going to Iet you die
in that alley.

176

It wasn't him.

have been one of his crew.

Helen, tell us where he is.
Come on.

They have a house,
where they keep scores.

180

Get off me, man. Get off me.

181
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,420
That's our grieving brother
right there.

Look who it is,
Mister Intelligence.
Our friend from Gang Intel.

It's not what it Iooks Iike.
BENSON:
Looks Iike a bust to me.

184
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:27,696
Thanks to our rape victim.

185
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,102
You knew her tattoo
meant Ghost Shadows
and you Iied about it.

00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,298
Look, I couldn't tell you.

187
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,398
We had a 15-month
investigation riding on this.

188
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:34,703
You're talking about
stolen property,

189
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:36,301
we're talking about a girl
that was brutalized.

190
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:38,642
Are we going to debate now
about whose job
is more important?

191
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:41,706
No, we're gonna debate
about you helping
our guy get away with rape.

192
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,217
You're Iooking at Johnny Chen
for this, right?

193
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:44,616
He knows who raped her.

194
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,120
He's yours. Hey.

195

Thanks.

197
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:55,397
I didn't do nothing.
I provide for Helen.
I take care of her.

198
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,056
Did you provide for her
to get raped?

199
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:58,690
No. Never.

200
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:01,736
Well, robbery places you
at the scene
of her attack there, Johnny.

201
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:02,930
Do you want to go down
for this?

202
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:05,405
You want to go down for raping
and beating your own sister?

203
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:09,539
When we went in, she was okay.

204
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:17,110
Okay.

205
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:19,684
And when you came out?

206
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,857
I didn't see her. Thought
she got scared and ran off.

00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:26,456
But then...

00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:30,093
I found her.

00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,159
I thought you said
you didn't see her.

211
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:37,035
I found her and then she was
so beat up. Nobody was around.

212
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:42,169
We heard sirens.
Then it got so crazy,
and she Iooked dead.

213
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,237
So you saved your own ass.

The brutality indicates

00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:18,410
Do you have any idea
who might have stolen it?

307
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,047
I wish. It was the week
I went out of town.

308
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:23,421
I was just kind of crazy,
so I guess
I just Ieft it somewhere.

309
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:24,857
Not too worried about money,
I guess.

310
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,021
Well, the credit card company
was cool.
They didn't make me pay.

311
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,324
Some weird charges, though.

312
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:31,389
I mean, whoever took it
probably didn't want his wife
to know.

313
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:32,558
Why? What do you mean?

314
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:35,262
Well, the guy was definitely
getting some action.

315
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:39,467
I have the statement
right here.
Look, China Girl, 200 bucks.

316
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,505
Massage parlor in Chinatown.

317
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,671
Where no one actually
gets a massage.

318
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:48,076
Police.

319
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:50,177
I'II need to see
a search warrant.

320
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:52,311
Just calm down.
We're not Vice. We're not INS.

321
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:54,252
We're Iooking for
one of your customers.

322
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:57,622
I maintain the strictest
confidentiality policy
with our clients.

323
00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:01,129
That's great.
Now, if you want a raid here,
I can arrange that.

324
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,535
We're Iooking for a man
that came in here
about two weeks ago.

325
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:13,597
African-American.
He used a credit card
with the name Larry Tang.

326
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:17,473
Come on, now.
Receipts. Give it up.

327
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:21,448
No need. I remember this guy.
He tried to kill
one of my girls.

328
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:29,014
Hey.
STABLER: Sorry to interrupt.

329
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:31,992
Jiang Li? We'd Iike to
have a word with you.

330
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:38,530
Can you tell us about the man
who attacked you?

331
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:44,428
Looked young, Iike 20s.

332
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,533
Nothing special about him.

333
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:50,669
Came in for a massage.
Didn't Iike it, I guess.

334
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:53,345
We're not Iooking
to set you up.

335
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:56,617
Just tell us the truth.
It stays right here.

336
00:16:57,252 --> 00:16:59,584
He said he wanted
a girlfriend.

337
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:04,686
Don't understand why
the racist son of a bitch
came to Chinatown.

338
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,591
He paid you
to be his girlfriend?

339
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:10,328
It was fine,
just regular stuff.

340
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,826
Except he couldn't do it.

341
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:16,734
I don't know,
I guess I Iaughed.

342
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,636
I didn't mean anything.
He got mad.

343
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:25,645
Tells me he want to tie me up.
Sometimes I do that.

344
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,942
But this guy,
I had a bad feeling.
So I said no.

345
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:31,610
BENSON: Did he hurt you?

346
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,513
Punched me a couple times.

347
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:39,182
Pull out this
Iittle army knife.

348
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:42,855
Call me names.

349
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:45,792
What did he do with the knife?

350
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:58,311
Do you think
you could describe him
to a sketch artist?

351
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:05,318
Faxed the sketch to area
schools with Chinese Ianguage
programs. Zero.

352
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:06,718
Nothing door-to-door, either.

353
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,221
So what are we missing?

354
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,350
I mean, here's a guy
who immerses himself
into another culture.

355
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:14,623
Masters the Ianguage,
Iies about his own ethnicity.

356
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:17,961
Then destroys the very culture
that he's imitated. Why?

357
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,593
He's chosen a culture
that's traditionally insular,

358
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,160
particularly among
the older generation.

359
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:27,937
I know that if my sister dated
a black man, my parents
would've strongly objected.

360
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,745
So this guy puts himself
in a position to get rejected,

361
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,441
not only as a man,
but as a non-Asian.

362
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:37,176
It's Iike he wants an excuse
to get mad.

363
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:38,480
Very possibly.

364
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:41,989
None of which helps
if we're working off
a bad sketch.

365
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:45,660
Got a hit on the DNA
from under the victim's nails.
African-American.

366
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:49,322
Sent up on multiple rape
and homicide. Just released
from CIinton Iast year.

367
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:51,160
So where is he now?

368
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:56,264
STABLER:
Where can we find him?

369
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,464
That's Starnes.

370
00:18:59,474 --> 00:19:00,532
BENSON: What's wrong with him?

371
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:04,306
Progressive MS.
This is a halfway house
for men with disabilities.

372
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,370
He's been pretty bad off
for a few years now.

373
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:07,938
Mistake at the Iab?

374
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,108
Maybe.

375
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:14,511
Mr. Starnes,
we're investigating a series
of rapes in Chinatown.

376
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,791
I ain't helping no cops.

377
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:19,861
But your DNA was all over
one of the victims,
and she's dead.

378
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:21,828
So maybe you want to help
yourself.

379
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:24,627
I can't even get out
of this chair, boy.

380
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,428
And if I could, it wouldn't be
to get with no downtown bitch.

381
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:34,067
You got any brothers,
cousins around?

382
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,970
Someone who might
want to set you up?

383
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,113
Mr. Starnes,
do you have any children?

384
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:49,123
Never had the pleasure.
You offering?

385
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,391
You've raped a Iot of women.

386
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,393
So it's possible
that you have kids out there

387
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:55,622
that you don't even
know about, right?

388
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,426
I suppose so, Iady.

389
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:07,230
PCR typing only Iooked
at 10 genetic markers.

390
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,869
Sometimes a person can have
a close enough match

391
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:11,913
to score a hit
within the database.

392
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,345
Can you do another test?

393
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:16,248
I ran a Y-chromosome
on Starnes and the perp.

394
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:20,220
The Y-chromosome is passed
from father to son
within a family Iine.

395
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:25,590
Grandfathers, fathers,
brothers, sons, nephews will
have virtually identical Ys.

396
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:28,828
There's no doubt about it.
These guys
are blood relatives.

397
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,660
Well, Halfway House
and prison records

398
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:33,132
says that Starnes has
no Iiving male relative.

399
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:36,659
That we know of.
He's a rapist. Our perp
could be this guy's son.

400
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:39,172
Makes sense.
Their DNA is similar.

401
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:42,740
Well, I guess
being a psychopath
runs in the family.

402
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:48,448
Vital statistics confirm
Starnes was not named on any
birth certificate as a father.

403
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,074
So we're Ieft with
his victims.

404
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:51,812
Starnes got sent up
on four rapes.

405
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:54,446
We ran the victims' names.
One came back. Martha Shelby.

406
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:57,184
Had a child that fits
the timeframe,
no father Iisted.

407
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:58,954
AII right, Iet's find her.

408
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:01,188
Now what about victims
they couldn't pin on him?

409
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:03,527
He Iooked good for three
unsolved rapes in Harlem,

410
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:05,964
but none of the victims
had a child
within nine months.

411
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,626
AII right, keep Iooking.
What else?

412
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:10,899
Starnes had a Iive-in
girlfriend that alibied him
on a couple of collars.

413
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:13,270
Pamela Tatum. She had a baby
while they were
Iiving together.

414
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:16,868
There's no father
on the birth certificate.
He'd be 23 now.

415
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:20,005
He's old enough
to be a suspect.
Track him and the mother down.

416
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:23,573
What's the odds that
both the father and son
turn out to be rapists?

417
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:26,314
You know,
some geneticists theorize
that violence is inherited.

418
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,789
Oh, that's right.
It's not my fault,
I was just born to kill.

419
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:31,155
It's a theory.

420
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:32,716
Well, it's ridiculous.

421
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:35,592
It's another way for people
not to take responsibility
for their actions.

422
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:37,359
Let's find the guy first.

423
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:40,424
We can discuss
the Human Genome Project
Iater.

424
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:45,595
You all right?

425
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,073
Yeah. Let's go.

426
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:54,303
Been a Iong time
since anybody's asked me
about Daniel.

427
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:56,574
I was 17 when I was raped.

428
00:21:56,718 --> 00:21:59,278
Three months Iater,
doctor told me I was pregnant.

429
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:00,912
I didn't know what to do.

430
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:03,787
According to the birth
certificate, you kept him.

431
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:07,919
I didn't think I could handle
an abortion. But in the end
it didn't matter.

432
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:10,328
What do you mean?

433
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:14,095
I went into Iabor two months
early. Daniel Iived two hours.

434
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:18,995
I know this sounds awful,
but in a way Daniel's death
was a relief.

435
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:23,636
I don't know that I could have
Iived with a constant reminder
of what happened to me.

436
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:29,450
Thank you for your time.

437
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:39,684
AII right. So now we go back
Iooking at rapes that Starnes
wasn't connected to.

438
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:42,525
Unsolved rapes from
20 years ago. It should be
easy enough to crack.

439
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:44,224
You got a better idea?

440
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,460
Yeah,
Iet's continue to pretend
this isn't bothering you.

441
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,331
EIIiot, knock it off.

442
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:52,936
You're gonna tell me
what Professor Shelby
said in there,

443
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:55,032
that's not getting to you?

444
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:57,371
I'm a child of rape, EIIiot.

445
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:00,380
I've known that
for a very Iong time,
and I appreciate your concern.

446
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:01,779
I really do.

447
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,683
But I've dealt with it.
So I'm fine.

448
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:16,591
How'd I know that bastard
would come back to haunt me?

449
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:17,688
How'd I know it?

450
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,631
When's the Iast time
you seen Harold Starnes?

451
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:23,762
Right before he got arrested.
Wised up and threw him out
finally.

452
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:25,032
How Iong did you
Iive with him?

453
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:26,573
Let him stay with me
two years,

454
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:29,371
just after he got evicted
from that dump in FIatbush.

455
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:30,638
Know how he thanks me?

456
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:33,772
Rapes and kills my best friend
in my own building.

457
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,281
Where was your son
at that time?

458
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,183
I had Michael about a year
before I kicked Harry out.

459
00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:40,653
He didn't want much to do
with a baby anyway.

460
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,485
Is Harry Michael's father?
Hell, no.

461
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:43,615
Mind if I ask who is?

462
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:45,750
That animal is not
Michael's father.

463
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:47,920
But you were Iiving with him
when Michael was born.

464
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:50,794
I had a Iot of boyfriends
back in the day,

465
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:53,629
and if you trying to make me
feel Iike a whore,
forget about it.

466
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:55,191
We're not trying to do that,
Miss Tatum.

467
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,568
What you want to know
all this for?

468
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:58,765
MUNCH:
DNA found at a crime scene.

469
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,365
Looks Iike Starnes has a son
who may be following
in his footsteps.

470
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:02,637
Know anything about it?

471
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,041
You kidding me. No.

472
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:06,410
Would you account
for your whereabouts
in the past few days?

473
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:09,780
I was at my girlfriend's in DC
for the Iast two weeks.

474
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:11,978
Just got back this morning.
AII right. That's enough.

475
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:14,988
My son is not a rapist.
I want you to Ieave.

476
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:16,351
Why don't you just
come with us?

477
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:18,517
Take a few tests, and we can
clear this whole thing up.

478
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:20,686
That man is not
Michael's father.

479
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:22,730
But you don't know
for sure, do you?

480
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:24,025
Get out.

481
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:28,165
If you're innocent, you don't
have anything to hide.

482
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:34,004
He fits the profile.
Could we compel a oral swab?

483
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:36,339
It's worth a shot. Let's see
what Cabot has to say.

484
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:37,469
Hey.

485
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,848
Man, I didn't hurt anybody.
I swear.

486
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,544
Then take the test.
It's real easy.

487
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:48,518
Look, I know what Starnes did,
and I don't want to know
if I'm his son.

488
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,387
There's no other way?

489
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,025
Would you be willing
to stand in a Iineup?

490
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:56,222
Yeah. Tell me when and where.

491
00:24:57,432 --> 00:25:00,230
We need an interpreter
to call in Sonja Yung
for the Iineup.

492
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:02,496
Cancel it.
Michael Tatum's alibi cleared.

493
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,095
He agreed to do it.
His mother Iived with Starnes
for two years.

494
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:08,973
No, he's not our guy.
He was seen in DC
when the attacks occurred.

495
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:10,977
Where are we
on unsolved rapes?

496
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:14,173
Nowhere. We don't have
a known address
for Starnes before 1977.

497
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,012
Which means he could've
been active anywhere.

498
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:18,814
We got five boroughs'
worth of cold cases
to wade through.

499
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:23,381
Not necessarily. Pamela Tatum
said that Starnes Iived
in FIatbush before Harlem.

500
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:25,855
Police never Iooked at Starnes
for rapes in Brooklyn.

501
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:29,090
Well, that sounds Iike a place
to start. Get the files.

502
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,028
STABLER: Where's your son now?

503
00:25:34,102 --> 00:25:37,299
I don't know. Sometimes
Darrell doesn't come home.

504
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:39,704
Thank you.

505
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:46,940
Mrs. Guan, our records
indicate that you were
a victim of rape in 1977.

506
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,407
Yes.

507
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,853
Did you become pregnant
because of that rape?

508
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:55,014
Why?

509
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:58,388
We're investigating attacks
against Asian women
in the area.

510
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,893
Here? That man is here?

511
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:04,498
The man who attacked you will
spend the rest of his Iife
in a wheelchair.

512
00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:09,570
Was he Darrell's father?

513
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,839
Yes.

514
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,373
I found out I was pregnant,

515
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:21,643
and I thought maybe something
good could come out
of what happened to me.

516
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:23,410
Is this your son?

517
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:26,551
His 21st birthday.

518
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:31,256
Mrs. Guan,

519
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:34,924
blood was found
at a murder scene
that may belong to Darrell.

520
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:36,122
So we need to know
where he is.

521
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:39,394
Darrell would never...
He's a good boy.

522
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,661
We just want to talk with him.

523
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:50,167
It's my fault.

524
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:55,940
I had hoped that because
he was my son,
they would have Ioved him.

525
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:57,642
BENSON: Who?

526
00:26:58,987 --> 00:27:03,083
My family.
Everyone in Chinatown.

527
00:27:05,627 --> 00:27:09,358
I moved in
with my mother and father
because I had no money.

528
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:14,100
When they saw him,
they told me to give him away.

529
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,697
He's half-devil, they said.

530
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:23,434
The children in the
neighborhood would hurt him,
push him, kick him.

531
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:31,041
Every day he'd cry, beg me
not to make him Ieave
the apartment.

532
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:32,686
Why didn't you move away?

533
00:27:36,591 --> 00:27:39,025
I guess part of me hated him,
too.

534
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:50,197
Have you seen anything that
makes you suspect Darrell's
done something wrong?

535
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:57,303
That photo Iooks nothing
Iike the sketch of Darrell.

536
00:27:57,378 --> 00:27:59,471
Those victims had to have
known he was half-Asian.

537
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:00,912
Why would they Iie?

538
00:28:00,982 --> 00:28:05,919
Look at this. Thrill Killing:
True Portrayals of America's
Most Vicious Murders,

539
00:28:05,987 --> 00:28:06,976
Hunting Human Beings,

540
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:08,044
Might explain these.

541
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:09,919
BIood?
Okay. We gotta get
CSU in here.

542
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:11,652
Oh, my God.

543
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:12,852
Where is he?

544
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:19,356
BENSON: Excuse me,
is Darrell Guan here?

545
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:21,299
No, he's on deliveries.
Be back in an hour.

546
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,803
We'II need to see those
addresses now.

547
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,532
Won't take me a minute.

548
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:27,164
Should've known
Darrell was up to something.

549
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,004
Why?
Well, a couple of women
complained.

550
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:30,066
Kept asking them out.

551
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:31,236
Are all your customers
in the computer?

552
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:32,802
Yeah.
May I?

553
00:28:38,486 --> 00:28:39,976
STABLER: Find anything?

554
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,552
Helen Chen and Lucy Zhang's
mother are both in here.

555
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:44,955
AIong with their
home addresses.

556
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:47,454
Victim's address
at the touch of a button.

557
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:48,859
Call for back up.

558
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:57,193
(BELL RINGING)

559
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:16,846
Darrell, stop.

560
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:18,852
Police!

561
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,727
Stop! Police!

562
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:25,498
Freeze. Police!
Okay. I didn't do anything.

563
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:32,901
Liv. AII right, we got him.
We got him, we got him.

564
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:37,542
STABLER: You got it?

565
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,415
What is it?

566
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:44,816
It's bleach.

567
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:55,161
Counselor,
I'm glad I ran into you.

568
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:59,097
Expect an updated witness Iist
on the Guan case
by the end of the week.

569
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,064
You're representing
Darrell Guan?

570
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:04,127
Little below your usual
tax bracket requirement,
isn't he, Margo?

571
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:06,571
I'm defending him pro bono.

572
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,699
Looking for headlines.

573
00:30:07,775 --> 00:30:11,472
Looking to save a Iife.
Keep the death penalty
off the table.

574
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:14,777
Your client
planned his attacks
and tried to cover his crimes.

575
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,339
He intentionally
selected his victims

576
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,977
based on race,
national origin,
ancestry and gender.

577
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:21,578
That's five
of the nine criteria
under the Hate Crimes Act,

578
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:23,317
which is an automatic
sentence enhancement.

579
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,583
He's not guilty of murder one.

580
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,151
The victim's blood was found
on Darrell's clothing.

581
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:30,254
His DNA was found under
one of the victim's nails.

582
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:33,095
The bottle of bleach used
in both crime scenes
was found in his possession.

583
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,965
What exactly is
your definition of guilt?

584
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:39,561
Guilt, noun.
From the Middle English
G-I-L-T.

585
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,803
The fact of being responsible
for the commission
of an offense.

586
00:30:42,877 --> 00:30:45,368
Operative word being
"responsible."

587
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:49,310
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

588
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:53,180
My parents made me
read the dictionary.

589
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:59,620
Margo Nelson's got
a PhD in molecular biology,

590
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:00,922
in addition to her Iaw degree.

591
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:03,054
So what the hell is she doing
defending a rapist?

592
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,325
Trying to set a precedent,
I think.
Look at her witnesses.

593
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,833
A geneticist, a biologist,
a genetic psychologist.

594
00:31:07,902 --> 00:31:09,460
AII for an insanity defense.

595
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:12,028
Not guilty by reason
of DNA. PIease.

596
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:15,665
She's trying to get the State
to pay for genetic testing
on Guan and Harold Starnes.

597
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:18,211
Prove the sins of the father
are visited on the son.

598
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,576
Wait, wait, wait.

599
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:24,311
The Frye standard
precludes scientific evidence

600
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:27,047
not generally accepted
by the scientific community.

601
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:30,716
So file a motion in Iimine.
Just keep it out.

602
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:33,624
I'm not sure that I can.
Nelson's got science
on her side.

603
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:36,219
It's a generally accepted
theory that violence
and genes are Iinked.

604
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:38,288
They're Iinked, not causative.

605
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:40,857
Do you trust a jury to make
that distinction? I don't.

606
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:43,495
It's your job to make sure
that they can.

607
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,129
I've got George Huang
doing a psych exam.

608
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:48,573
Hopefully, he can prove
Darrell knew exactly
what he was doing.

609
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:51,168
Listen to me,
if Nelson pulls this off,

610
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,679
it's a Pandora's box
for criminal prosecution,

611
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:57,684
because everything can be
blamed on the confluence
of bad genes.

612
00:31:57,752 --> 00:32:00,243
And then no one
is truly responsible
for their own actions.

613
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:01,481
That's what I'm afraid of.

614
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:04,046
Good,
then don't Iet it happen.

615
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:11,892
Do you know why I'm here,
Darrell?

616
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:13,456
To see if I'm crazy.

617
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:18,301
To see if you're competent
to stand trial. Why? Do you
think that you're crazy?

618
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,772
If I say no, I get
the death penalty, right?

619
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:24,868
Usually the Iawyers Iet me
make the diagnosis,
not the defendant.

620
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:27,176
But I'm just wondering
what you think.

621
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:29,773
You're Chinese.

622
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:31,941
Why, yes, I am.

623
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,516
So am I.

624
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:40,391
Actually, you're half-Chinese,
aren't you?

625
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:46,563
You're tow gee,

626
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:51,896
You think that
I'm the privileged
and spoiled Iandowner?

627
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:55,703
Isn't that what
the native Chinese call
the American-born Chinese?

628
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:58,711
But you're American-born
as well, aren't you?

629
00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:04,083
Was it difficult for you
growing up in Chinatown?

630
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,140
No.

631
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:06,516
You speak the Ianguage
very well.

632
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:09,078
You know the customs
probably better than I do.

633
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:13,490
But I imagine for many people
in Chinatown,
you were still an outcast.

634
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:14,653
Didn't bother me.

635
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,822
The kids probably
picked on you
when you were growing up.

636
00:33:16,897 --> 00:33:17,955
That must have been difficult.

637
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:21,092
Even your own family
must have treated you
differently.

638
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,993
What do you know
about your father?

639
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:26,667
Enough.

640
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,298
How old were you
when you found out
that he'd raped your mom?

641
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:32,676
I don't remember. Young.
My mother's mother told me.

642
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:34,938
Why did she tell you that?

643
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:36,108
Haak gwai,

644
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:39,784
BIack devil.
She called you that?

645
00:33:41,322 --> 00:33:42,983
It doesn't matter.

646
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:49,060
What about your father?
How do you feel
about your father?

647
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:56,827
I'm nothing Iike him.

648
00:33:57,838 --> 00:34:00,272
Look at what you've done,
Darrell.

649
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:02,901
Your whole Iife you've tried
not to be Iike him.

650
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:05,502
But you're violent.
You hurt people.

651
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:08,706
You rape them.
Like father, Iike son.

652
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:17,051
Get out!

653
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,789
MAN: Darrell, calm down.
Take it easy.

654
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:23,427
Okay, okay, okay.
Take it easy.

655
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:26,063
Gee, okay.

656
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:34,369
Have you discovered
what some theorists term
the "violence gene"?

657
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:38,242
Well, there is no
"violence gene" per se,

658
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:42,476
and violent behavior can be
Iinked to the expression
of several abnormal genes.

659
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,642
For instance?

660
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:48,950
A defective DRD2 A1 allele
may Iead to pleasure-seeking

661
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:52,424
or addictive behavior,
as well as violence.

662
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,218
You conducted several
DNA tests on Mr. Guan.

663
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:59,164
Does he suffer from this
particular gene abnormality?

664
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:00,257
Yes, he does.

665
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:03,132
And what about his biological
father, Harold Starnes?

666
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:06,105
He suffers from
the exact same abnormality.

667
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,673
Mr. Starnes
is a convicted rapist.

668
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:12,974
Would you say that his son
inherited these violent
tendencies from his father?

669
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:15,709
Objection. No matter
how much research
Dr. Coffey has done,

670
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:17,683
he cannot definitively
answer that question.

671
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:22,154
I agree. Let's try and keep it
out of the realm of science
fiction, Miss Nelson.

672
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:25,425
Are gene mutations inherited,
Dr. Coffey?

673
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:26,983
Certainly they can be.

674
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:31,964
I mean, take for instance
the genetic disease
cystic fibrosis.

675
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:35,862
Both parents must possess
the recessive gene
and pass it on to the child

676
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,904
in order for the child
to have the illness.

677
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:41,669
If they don't have the gene,
the child will not get
the illness.

678
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:46,111
Would a person with cystic
fibrosis have any control
over contracting the disease?

679
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,445
No. He will have inherited
the gene at conception.

680
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:53,180
And Iike that disease,
if a child inherited genes
that made him violent,

681
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:56,189
he wouldn't have any control
over that either, correct?

682
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:57,315
That's correct.

683
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:02,590
So from a genetic standpoint,
since Harold Starnes
was a violent man,

684
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,394
it's not completely out
of the realm of possibility

685
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:08,901
that his son was born violent,
as well.

686
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:12,370
Objection. How did we go from
talking about inherited genes
to inherited behavior?

687
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,373
I apologize.
I'II try to speak slowly

688
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,773
and use smaller words
so you can keep up with us.

689
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:17,936
RIDENOUR: Counselor.

690
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:21,140
Dr. Coffey has not
specifically proven
inherited behavior.

691
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:23,547
Are we just going to
make up new theories
as we go along?

692
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:27,075
No, I think it's better that
we take the word of an
assistant district attorney

693
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:28,815
over that
of a scientific expert.

694
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:31,790
Objection sustained.
Move it along, Miss Nelson.

695
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,986
Nothing further, Your Honor.

696
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:40,400
Are all people with
a defective DRD2 A1
allele rapists, Dr. Coffey?

697
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:44,767
Well, the gene defect
predisposes one towards
violent behavior.

698
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:46,999
That wasn't the question,
I will rephrase it.

699
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:50,840
If a man has a defect,
is he absolutely
going to be a rapist?

700
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,845
No. Not absolutely.

701
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,041
We know with
the cystic fibrosis gene

702
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:57,208
if a child inherits the gene
from each of the parents,

703
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:59,445
he or she will have
the disease.

704
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,818
Is that the case with
the so-called "violent gene"?

705
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,414
Well, a causative connection
has not yet been established.

706
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:07,221
But aren't you asserting
your research predicts
violent behavior

707
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,262
based on genetic makeup?

708
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:13,058
No. There are other factors
such as upbringing.

709
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:17,160
You never mentioned that
in your testimony. It sounded
to me as if you were saying

710
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:20,002
genes are the only factor
in violent behavior.

711
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:22,838
Well, I can't very well speak
to the influence
of environment.

712
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,207
I am a geneticist.

713
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:26,371
I see. So your testimony now

714
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:29,416
is that violent behavior is,
in fact,
a combination of many factors,

715
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,848
not just genetic.
Yes.

716
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,386
So, in truth, you really can't
speak to the topic
at all, can you?

717
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:34,512
Objection.
RIDENOUR: Counselor?

718
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,818
Withdrawn. Nothing further.

719
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:43,495
NELSON: Complex
scientific evidence aside,

720
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:46,055
this case is about
the choices we make

721
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,194
and the choices
that are made for us.

722
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,099
Did Darrell Guan choose
for his father
to rape his mother,

723
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:56,002
to be brought up
in a community, in a family,

724
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:59,876
that every single day berated,
belittled and stigmatized him?

725
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:02,910
Did he choose to have
a genetic defect?

726
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:04,717
No.

727
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,455
And now we're supposed to
tell him, "Well, too bad.
You should have known better."

728
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:17,689
Darrell was born and Iived
in hell. His grandmother
called him the devil.

729
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,756
Well, of course he was.

730
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,324
He was engineered,
by nature and by nurture,

731
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:25,099
to be exactly
what he turned out to be.

732
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:28,098
And that is not his fault.

733
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:38,317
Yes, Darrell Guan
had a difficult Iife.

734
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,979
He was raised knowing
the only reason he exists

735
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:44,684
is because his mother
was violently raped.

736
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:48,717
One could understand why
he wouldn't grow up
to be a well-adjusted adult.

737
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:51,487
But that's not an excuse
for murder.

738
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:57,100
In a civilized society,
we have to take responsibility
for our actions.

739
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:01,903
If we start to justify all
antisocial behavior under the
pretense it isn't our fault,

740
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:05,206
then the entire structure
of the Iaw is meaningless.

741
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:10,850
In the end, it comes down to
what it is to be
a human being.

742
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:15,318
We're not just a product
of our genetic programming,

743
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:19,892
nor are we solely molded
and motivated by
our childhood experiences.

744
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,896
The defense would have you
believe Darrell Guan's Iife
was beyond his control.

745
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:27,593
But the truth is, he was in
complete control at the time
he committed his crimes.

746
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:30,102
He specifically
chose his victims,

747
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,573
not because of some
biological imperative,
but because of opportunity.

748
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:37,307
He knew what he was doing
was wrong,

749
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:40,279
and he did everything
he could to get away with it.

750
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:45,709
Darrell Guan chose
the course of his Iife.

751
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:51,183
Make him take responsibility
for it.

752
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:05,930
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

753
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:07,132
Come in.

754
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:08,606
BENSON: Hey.

755
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:11,601
The verdict came in
on the Darrell Guan case.

756
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,277
He's guilty on all charges.

757
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:14,439
I heard.

758
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:18,247
That was a tough case for me.

759
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:23,615
Seems to have been
a tough case for you, as well.

760
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:31,790
My mother was a rape victim.

761
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:36,028
She got pregnant. She had me.

762
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,764
So, yeah, it was personal.

763
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,944
I think I'd be Iying
if I didn't admit that that's
probably the biggest reason

764
00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:50,677
that I decided to become
a cop. You know, to join SVU.

765
00:40:51,885 --> 00:40:55,753
I used to think that
it was because I wanted
to do something good,

766
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:58,121
you know, make a difference.

767
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:02,456
But you're questioning
those reasons now?

768
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:07,364
I don't know. You know, I...

769
00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:11,000
I mean, Iook at my job. I'm...

770
00:41:12,473 --> 00:41:16,603
I have to be aggressive,
even violent.

771
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:21,672
And you think that makes you
Iike Darrell Guan.

772
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:28,582
Well, Iook at Darrell Guan.

773
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:35,291
I keep trying to convince
myself that he had a choice.

774
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:40,900
You know, be a rapist,
don't be a rapist. Be violent,
don't be violent. But...

775
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:47,840
If he had this aggression
inside him,

776
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:50,900
even violence, then,

777
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,904
does he have a choice?

778
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:57,849
Does anyone?

779
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:04,819
You don't hurt people, OIivia.

780
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,125
You protect them.

781
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:11,892
You're proof that
we do have a choice.

782
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,209
Or...

783
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:28,544
Or maybe I'm just Iucky.
