NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:03,866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,964
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:08,033
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:11,672
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,716
These are their stories,

00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,684
RICK: Oh, God, how old
is Peyton anyway?

10
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:20,882
Don't you dare ask.

11
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:22,481
(BOTTLE CLATTERING)
What was that?

12
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:26,326
Peyton? Max?

13
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:29,263
Oh, wait,
it might be a burglar.

14
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,801
We need a weapon.
Oh, we're armed.

15
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:36,668
Max.
Max?

16
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,430
Max?

17
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:40,937
RICK: What's he doing?

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,402
Max!

19
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:44,135
ED: Max?

DIANE: Oh, my God!

00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:51,081
ED: Oh, my God, Peyton!

22
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:56,186
It's okay.
Thank you so much.

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,692
Friends came to set up
a surprise party.

24
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:02,390
Husband was supposed
to keep the wife out
until 10:30.

25
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:04,831
What happened,
they come home early?
Or they never Ieft.

26
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:07,631
They had an 8:00 reservation
at AIain Ducasse.

27
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:09,102
Call came in at 10:07.

28
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:11,231
What was our perp
doing with them
for over two hours?

29
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:14,799
Putting on a show.
Complete with
a captive audience.

30
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:18,040
Husband gets
a front-row viewing
of his wife being raped.

31
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:20,344
She gets to watch him
get beaten to death.

32
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:21,814
(CAMERA CLICKING)

33
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:24,882
BENSON: Back door was open?
Yeah.

34
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,514
Party guests said
they heard something
crash in the kitchen.

35
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,650
Could be this beer bottle.
Perp got spooked
when he heard them come in.

36
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:33,217
Left through the service door.
Yeah, but how'd he
get in here?

37
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:35,526
Well, the Iock wasn't jimmied.

38
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:39,228
Had a bag of spilled garbage
out here.
STABLER: Could be a push-in.

39
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:42,066
Wife's probably only alive
'cause our guy
got the munchies.

40
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:45,733
Preserve and voucher
that food for saliva
and bite marks.

41
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:49,642
You're gonna want to
get this, too.
Some birthday, huh?

42
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,032
Multiple orbital fractures,

43
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:49,868
clean breaks
through the zygoma,
shattered mandible.

44
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:53,136
Seems your perp had
a real problem with the way
this guy Iooked.

45
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:55,973
Pistol-whipped, huh?
A few dozen times.

46
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,946
Perp goes to the trouble
of bringing a semi-automatic
with him,

47
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:01,210
why not just shoot the guy?
Where'd the fun be in that?

48
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:04,117
Well, how do you know
it's a semi?
It Ieaves an L-shaped pattern.

49
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:08,351
See this rectangular outline?
Common among
semi-automatic grips.

50
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:11,086
As opposed to revolvers,
which are rounded.

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,287
I don't suppose
you can narrow it down
any further?

52
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:16,297
If you Iook closely,
you'II see the slip grip
was cross-hatched.

53
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:20,825
Oh, it's a waffle pattern,
Iike a ping-pong paddle.

54
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:21,995
Exactly.

55
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:27,202
That distinct texture,
coupled with the size of
the grip are consistent with,

56
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:31,303
here it is, a Ruger P94,
9 millimeter.

57
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:33,072
She's good.

58
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:35,344
Victims have a pet?
Not that we know of.

59
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,409
Found some hairs
in the adhesive residue

60
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:39,750
on his skin
from the duct tape.

61
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:42,052
Probably dog or cat.

62
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:44,718
STABLER: This should make
your job easier,
cut along the dotted Iine.

63
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:47,888
Most Iikely had bypass surgery
sometime within the Iast year.

64
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:52,958
Medical magic saves this guy
from death, only to make him
suffer through this hell.

65
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,671
Max smelled tuna fish.

66
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,743
We were already running Iate,
but he insisted
on taking it out.

67
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,580
If only he'd just Ieft it.

68
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,175
BENSON: We saw the bag
in the service hall.

69
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,259
When Max came back in,
a man in a ski mask
had a gun to his head.

70
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:23,290
STABLER:
Can you describe him at all?

71
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:26,892
Height, weight?

72
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:31,231
Average.
Eye color?

73
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:37,944
BENSON: Then what happened?

74
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:42,678
Oh, he threw
a roll of duct tape at me.

75
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,314
He made me bind and gag Max.

76
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:49,488
I did it as Ioosely
as I could.

77
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:54,157
But after he put me up
on the table, he re-did it.

78
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:58,223
He hit Max so many times.

79
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:02,763
Then he'd stop and rape me.

80
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:05,638
Max struggled so hard.

81
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,935
Then he'd beat Max again.

82
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:16,650
Oh, it seemed to go on
for hours,

83
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:22,619
but finally
Max stopped struggling.

84
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:31,289
There was a Iockbox
broken into in the closet.

85
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:34,666
Can you tell us
what was in there?
Just some cash.

86
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:37,033
$10,000 or $15,000.

87
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:40,165
BENSON:
And in your jewelry box?

88
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:46,941
AII my grandmother's jewelry.

89
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:49,814
STABLER: We'II need you
to describe those pieces
to a sketch artist.

90
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:52,445
Now Mrs. KIeberg,
think very hard.

91
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,917
Did the man say anything
that would make you think

92
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:59,426
that he knew you
or your husband?

93
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:02,887
He didn't say one word

94
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:07,095
the entire time.

95
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,407
Had some trouble
a while back
with a homeless guy,

96
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:20,779
kept sneaking in behind cars
as they entered the garage.

97
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,943
What'd you do with him?
Woke him up,
kicked him out.

98
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:24,212
Seen him Iately?

99
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:26,618
Not since management
sent tenants a notice,

100
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,486
"Look behind you
when you're coming in."

101
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,616
Your other two break-ins
occurred when tenants
were out.

102
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,854
Must be a coincidence.
Wonder how the guy knew.

103
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:34,657
Oh, that's right,
you gave him the key.

104
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,630
You knew
when they were supposed
to be gone, didn't you?

105
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,030
If you're Iooking
at me for this,

106
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,160
you must have gone
to detective school
on a special yellow bus.

107
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:43,728
So I'm gonna help you
out here.
You do that.

108
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:47,264
A while back, this guy comes
Iooking for the doctor, Iike,
crazy, pissed.

109
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:49,277
FIN: You get his name?
No, it was months ago.

110
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:50,334
So I buzzed the doctor.

111
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:53,177
He got all nervous,
said to call the police
if he didn't Ieave.

112
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:54,375
MUNCH:
What was the guy's beef?

113
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,250
Said the doctor
was a mad scientist,
ruined his Iife.

114
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,414
What kind of doctor
was that again?
Urologist.

115
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:08,458
BENSON: We're Iooking
for the Chief of Urology.

116
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:12,095
Dr. Karr,
the two detectives are here.

117
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:13,897
He'II just be a minute.
Thank you.

118
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:18,565
Lara? Right.
How well did you
know Dr. KIeberg?

119
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:20,871
He was one of the best
surgeons here.

120
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,740
I still can't believe
he was murdered.

121
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:25,838
BENSON: We heard he had
a problem with one of his
patients earlier this year.

122
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:28,281
Might have caused a scene?
Oh, right.

123
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,318
The guy from the doctor's
clinical trials.

124
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:31,717
STABLER:
CIinical trials for what?

125
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:34,483
Impotency.
BENSON: You remember his name?

126
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:37,048
Martin something.
I can check the files.

127
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:40,289
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Dr. Karr.
Hi.

128
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:44,492
I've got a meeting
in the north wing.
Do you mind walking with me?

129
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:47,297
Well, Iife doesn't make sense.

130
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,894
I thought we Iost Max
six months ago
with the CABG.

131
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:52,873
Cabbage?
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft.

132
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:54,967
Peyton was an angel,
nursed him back to health.

133
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:59,208
He was good as new.
No, better. More alive.

134
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:00,976
He specialized in impotency?

135
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,713
Well, a urologist's bread
and butter is prostate cancer,
urethral dysfunctions,

136
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:07,017
congenital anomalies,
kidney transplants.

137
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:09,489
Max specialized
in sexual dysfunctions,

138
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:12,994
incontinence, penile implants
and, of course, impotence.

139
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:16,828
Now, we understand that
Dr. KIeberg was testing
new treatments in that area.

140
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,834
An impotency cream,
a nitric-oxide analog.

141
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:23,998
It's a novel delivery system
to create vasospasm
at the base of the penis

142
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:26,234
to keep the corpus
cavernosum engorged.

143
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,367
An erection.
Precisely.

144
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:31,311
Viagra was the fastest-selling
drug in history,

145
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,143
so you can imagine
the interest in this one.

146
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:36,343
So how rich
was Dr. KIeberg gonna be
once that got FDA approved?

147
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:37,749
Oh, it doesn't work
that way.

148
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,617
AII Max got
was a minimal finder's fee

149
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,053
for every patient
he brought into the trial.

150
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:44,490
Now, we understand that
he had at Ieast
one dissatisfied customer.

151
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,687
First name Martin?

152
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:51,461
I'm sorry, I can't comment
on that case.
Medical case or Iegal case?

153
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,566
It's our policy
not to comment on either.

154
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:56,468
Now, if you'II excuse me,
this is my meeting.

155
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,303
Wait. If you know something
that will help us
find KIeberg's killer,

156
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,900
you're gonna
need to tell us.

157
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:05,378
Look, all I can say is
the participants
in Max's trials

158
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:08,905
suffered extreme
physical impotence.

159
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:12,249
Men out of options
before they ever
walked in here.

160
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,978
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)

161
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,249
Sounded Iike someone
with something to hide.

162
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,692
Yeah. I say we have
Cabot see a judge
about getting past it.

163
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:23,357
I found the file.
His Iast name is Welker.
Martin Welker.

164
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,060
I made copies for you.
Thank you.

165
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:30,736
Power. Control. Humiliation.

166
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:33,297
He shows
all the outward features
of sadistic behavior.

167
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:38,210
We're talking sexual sadist?
He needed to inflict pain
for excitement.

168
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,407
He raped her
in front of the husband
he spent a good Iong time

169
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:41,813
beating to death.
How's that for pain?

170
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:44,549
CRAGEN: This guy took
periodic snack breaks.

171
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,384
A cold predator who feels
in complete control.

172
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:49,447
He never said a word
the entire two hours.

173
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,117
Well, it could be
fear of detection,

174
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:52,751
especially if he's known
to these people.

175
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:54,625
HUANG: Or sensory depravation.

176
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:57,632
His victims need to Iook
for cues of what to do
in order to survive,

177
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,897
and he never gives them a one.
He knows that it's gonna
intensify the terror.

178
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,460
Sociopath.

179
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:06,030
You're Iooking for someone
who has a history of violating
the rights of others,

180
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:10,408
who's numb to the world,
who has aggressive sex,
drugs, fights.

181
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,538
BENSON: Captain.
Join the party.

182
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:15,846
What do you got?
Martin's file,
theirs and ours.

183
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:19,649
He participated
in the hospital's trial
for impotency.

184
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:22,350
He stopped abruptly
in the 12th week when...

185
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:24,756
He was arrested
by Brooklyn SVU
for attempted rape.

186
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,988
Attacked a woman
in the subway,
30 years old.

187
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:29,587
And then he bashed in
the skulls of two guys
who tried to help her.

188
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:33,362
Aggressive sex,
fighting, violating
the rights of others.

189
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:35,062
Pay him a visit.

190
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:40,275
Martin Welker?
What do you want?

191
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:43,607
Why the Iong puss?
Dr. KIeberg's dead.
Your problems are solved.

192
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,079
Oh, no, no. That wasn't me.
Didn't say it was.

193
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:49,777
Must be your
guilty conscience speaking.
Where were you Tuesday night?

194
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,615
I was at group.
What kind of group?

195
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:54,349
What are you,
12-stepper, AA, NA?

196
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:58,826
No "A." Group therapy.
I keep things bottled up.
UIcers.

197
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:01,590
Quiet guys
are the most dangerous.
Loner, keeps to himself.

198
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:03,825
FIN: Yeah. One day
he explodes on the subway.

199
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,663
Suddenly he's up
for attempted rape,
assault and battery.

200
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,327
Oh, no. That wasn't my fault.

201
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:10,497
KIeberg never told me
about the side effects.

202
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,836
Before the cream,
I couldn't even
talk to a woman.

203
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:14,500
That's why when you were
raping Mrs. KIeberg,

204
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:16,806
you never made a peep?

205
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,346
I don't know
what you guys
are talking about.

206
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:21,906
Doctor Rise-and-Shine
ruined your Iife. You spent
six months in prison.

207
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:24,475
Now the only job you can get
is cleaning up pigeon crap.

208
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,851
AII he had to do
was tell the jury
that it was the cream,

209
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:27,911
that it wasn't me.

210
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,050
But he wouldn't do it,
would he?
He sat up there and he Iied.

211
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:33,185
He said that I have
violent tendencies,

212
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:34,957
that it had nothing to do
with the medication.

213
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,590
Somebody had to pay though,
didn't they, Martin?
We checked.

214
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,931
We know you filed Iawsuits
against the hospital and
the pharmaceutical company.

215
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:44,336
But you didn't file
against Dr. KIeberg.
What's up with that?

216
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:46,135
My Iawyer said
he was judgment-proof.

217
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,835
MUNCH: What does he
mean by that?

218
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,004
Son-of-a-bitch didn't have
a penny to his name.

219
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,612
FIN: So the doctor was broke?

220
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:59,381
Well, it's much more
complicated than that.

221
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:03,448
So is subpoenaing records,
but we'II do it.
Dr. KIeberg's, yours.

222
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,590
Max had a heart condition.

223
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:10,030
Even before his bypass,
no medical malpractice
company would cover him.

224
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,260
And he wanted to continue
practicing medicine,

225
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,234
but to do so, he had
to protect his assets.

226
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:17,500
I recommended
he move everything
into Peyton's name.

227
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:19,370
It was completely Iegal.

228
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:22,774
What kind of money
are we talking about?
AII told, $5 million.

229
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:25,075
That's a Iot of hidden assets.
Anybody else Iooking for them?

230
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:26,842
No one who could be
involved in this.

231
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:29,884
Why don't you
just run it by us,
Iet us be the judge?

232
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,951
Well, Max had
a Iittle trouble
with his son.

233
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:34,283
MUNCH: I didn't know
he had a son.

234
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:36,756
Jesse.
From Max's first marriage.

235
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,952
We had to cut off
his trust fund.

236
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,517
When was this?
Last week.

237
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:42,689
Why?
Again, it's complicated.

238
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:46,997
Max and Jesse have been
estranged for years
ever since he married Peyton.

239
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:48,434
Why'd he cut him off?

240
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:51,996
Well, Jesse broke
into the co-op
a few weeks ago,

241
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:55,874
and Max caught him
trying to steal
his stepmother's jewelry.

242
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,305
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way out here.

243
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:03,374
I'm inconveniencing
so many people.

244
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:06,314
I couldn't face
going home yet.

245
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,322
PIease, we understand.

246
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,157
Mrs. KIeberg,
what can you tell us
about your stepson?

247
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:14,695
Jesse?
Mmm-hmm.

248
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,555
I haven't seen him
in several years.

249
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:23,501
What about him?
Well, he didn't go
to his father's funeral.

250
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,998
No.

251
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,907
We understand that
he broke into your apartment
a few weeks ago.

252
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:33,709
He didn't break in.
He has a key.

253
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:37,081
There's been an estrangement,
but he has
always been welcome.

254
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,590
Well, you can't be thinking...
He did try to steal
your jewelry before.

255
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,058
It wasn't Jesse.

256
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,493
Your attacker wore a ski mask
and he never spoke.

257
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:48,928
No!
STABLER: Your husband
had just cut off

258
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:51,966
his trust fund.
Only until he could Iearn
to be responsible.

259
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:54,901
You know, kids in college,
they mismanage.

260
00:13:56,538 --> 00:14:00,474
He wouldn't do
something Iike that.
He is Max's son.

261
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:05,241
Mrs. KIeberg, you said
that your attacker was of
average height and build.

262
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:07,407
How would you describe Jesse?

263
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,752
How's Jesse adapting
to dorm Iife?

264
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:20,954
At Ieast here his Gestapo
stepdad isn't searching
through his things,

265
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,997
violating his basic
human rights.

266
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:25,397
Taking a civics course
this semester, are we?

267
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:29,267
I'm applying at Stanford Law,
after which I plan
on working for the ACLU.

268
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:31,067
Civil Iiberties, good.
Lawyers, bad.

269
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,108
Hate to think Jesse was alone
when he heard about
what happened to his dad.

270
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:36,610
Happen to know where
he was that night?

271
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:39,272
I think you gained access
under false pretenses.

272
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:41,145
Why don't you just Ieave
a card for Jesse?

273
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,774
Why, Jesse got
something to hide?

274
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,342
No. Not that you even have
a right to ask.

275
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,786
Actually, the first amendment
gives him the right to ask.

276
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,347
The fifth amendment gives you
the right not to answer.

277
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:52,916
And just what do you think
I'd be incriminating
myself about?

278
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:56,988
Let's say you had knowledge
of stolen goods
being stored here, accessory.

279
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:59,727
What?
IIIegal substances,
possession.

280
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:02,031
I don't do drugs,
neither does Jesse.

281
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:06,268
Right. Well, if he's not
snorting his family fortune,
where's it all going?

282
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:13,278
MAN ON PA: Last call for
the third race,,, Last call,
There he is.

283
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:14,542
AII right.

284
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:18,245
$500 Perfecta on the 2-5 box
and a $500 straight.

285
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:23,688
I'm sorry,
can I see some ID, please?
What?

286
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,989
Do you have ID on you?

287
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:30,020
Look, man, I've been
betting here all day.
Not at this window, sir.

288
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:31,759
It's a minute till post,
all right?

289
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,097
PIease step aside
so the gentleman can...

290
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:37,263
Stop jacking me around
and run my freaking bet!

291
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:41,473
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What...
Saving you $1,000.

292
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:44,444
Salutation and Jake's Delight
are useless on turf.

293
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:46,174
It's okay. We got this.

294
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,344
Drugs, I get. But the ponies?

295
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:52,114
You really see that Ieading
to rape/homicide?

296
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:55,088
If he's a compulsive gambler
he Iacks impulse control.

297
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,557
It's consistent
with the degree of overkill
in your homicide.

298
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,924
Compulsive gambler?
He's 18.

299
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:02,327
AImost six percent of kids
even younger than Jesse

300
00:16:02,397 --> 00:16:04,194
have a serious
gambling problem.

301
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:07,235
BENSON: Well, that adds up.
He started stealing from
his parents four years ago.

302
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:09,793
STABLER:
Probably playing Iotteries,
betting on football pools.

303
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:13,807
Do you gamble, EIIiot?
Only with birth control.

304
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,706
Kids who come from
a non-gambling environment

305
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:18,302
are Iess Iikely to become
gamblers themselves.

306
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,577
CRAGEN: How Iikely are they
to rape their stepmothers?

307
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,780
Maybe tying into some feedback
Ioop of taking more risks,
needing higher stakes?

308
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:29,085
No. That's unrelated
Oedipal complex.

309
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,784
But you know,
studies are Iooking
to identify

310
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:34,556
the abnormal
neurobiological mechanisms
in pathological gamblers.

311
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,893
Linked to violent behavior?

312
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:41,026
Well, nothing's cut-and-dried.
I'II know more
after the interview.

313
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:45,864
STABLER: High roller, huh?

314
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,568
BENSON: How'd you start?

315
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,173
My parents made me,

316
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,581
Your parents forced you
to gamble?

317
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:59,651
My mom and stepmom
were both charity junkies.

318
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:02,417
Since when is charity
a game of chance?

319
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,922
Look, you know
what the biggest
fundraising gimmick is?

320
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:08,292
Casino nights.

321
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:10,888
So they made you bet
until it hurt?

322
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:13,696
Look, my mom
organized the game
since I was, Iike, 12.

323
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:16,203
She'd give me
a bushel of chips and say,
"Go have fun."

324
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:19,206
It's just a short hop
from there to the OTB.

325
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:22,169
In high school,
I would make a poker game,

326
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:24,371
then it was road trips
to Atlantic City.

327
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:26,812
Well, you got to be 21
to get in those casinos.

328
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:28,873
I never had any trouble.

329
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:33,984
So how deep in are you?
$100,000.

330
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:35,415
(WHISTLES)

331
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:38,356
Yeah, I got behind
with my bookie

332
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:40,657
and Iaid 50 grand
on the Giants game.

333
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:43,826
Probably gonna have
my Iegs broken.

334
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:46,993
This bookie, would he go
after your parents?

335
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,431
It's a first-name business.
How would he know
who they were?

336
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:52,939
Jesse, why didn't you just
ask your parents for help?

337
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,407
I did.

338
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:57,411
After my dad
caught me breaking in.
And?

339
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:01,206
And he didn't believe me.

340
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,878
Thought it was...
He thought it was drugs,
just Iike my freaking stepdad.

341
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:12,987
You know, people are gonna
hurt me, and he wouldn't
give me a dime.

342
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:18,322
Where were you
Tuesday night, Jesse?

343
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,760
What? Oh, you guys are crazy.

344
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,827
You went back for the money.
You got even with your dad.

345
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:25,099
No. No, no, no! No.

346
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,068
I'm Jesse's attorney.
This interview stops now.

347
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,479
Hey, Jesse never
asked for a Iawyer.
Who called in the dragon Iady?

348
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,917
Mother.
Who, Peyton?

349
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,979
Nope, the biological mother.
She's in with the Captain.

350
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:46,016
More good news. Martin Welker,
the disgruntled patient,

351
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,755
DNA cleared him.

352
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,001
Captain Cragen,
I put Max KIeberg
through medical school,

353
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,562
and as soon as that bastard
became a doctor,
he deserted us.

354
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,268
From his grave,
he's still hurting Jesse.

355
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:04,870
Detectives,
this is Marilyn Dunlap,
Jesse's mother.

356
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:07,176
These are...
The two that arrested my son.

357
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:10,707
Do you have any idea
how much money I give to
that Police Athletic League?

358
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:14,221
Ma'am, if this was
a traffic citation,
we'd probably Iet it slide,

359
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,483
but it's a rape/homicide.

360
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:17,548
It's false arrest.
Nobody's been arrested.

361
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:20,186
We're just talking to him.
He had nothing to do with it.

362
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:22,787
Mrs. Dunlap,
I'm sure that you know
more than anyone

363
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:24,798
how much resentment
your son had for his father.

364
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:27,699
He had 18 years
to deal with the fact that
he had a rotten father,

365
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:30,329
and if this is about
resentment, you should be
talking to Peyton.

366
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,568
Hers was good and raw.
What kind of resentment?

367
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,132
Ever since
Max's heart attack,

368
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,236
he'd been nailing
just about anything
that moved.

369
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:39,439
Did Peyton know?

370
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:43,006
She knew when I ran into her
at the Covenant House
fundraiser Iast month. Yes.

371
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:45,848
BENSON: Well,
how did she find out?
I told her.

372
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:48,154
Did you give her names?

373
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:52,523
Look, I don't have anything
against them, just Max.

374
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:56,659
That's very noble,
but we're still gonna
need that Iist.

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,130
Well, I know for a fact
that he was doing
his boss's secretary.

376
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:07,205
A doctor smiles at you
around here, people make
a soap opera out of it.

377
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,108
Oh, so you weren't
having an affair?

378
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:13,306
After the operation,
Max was a different person.

379
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:18,114
He was Iike a teenager,
you know? He was funny
and sexy and...

380
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:22,352
It was a fling.
FIing. When did it end?

381
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:25,484
Months ago.
But we stayed friends.

382
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:30,059
If there was anything
I could do to help
find his killer I would.

383
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:33,123
That's why I gave you
that file.
Well, it wasn't him.

384
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:35,396
So if you still wanna help us,
why don't you
start by telling us

385
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,371
who he was sleeping with
at the time he was killed?

386
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,635
You make him sound so dirty.
It wasn't Iike that.

387
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:42,438
STABLER: So how was it?

388
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,276
There was a month
after his recovery
where he went a Iittle crazy.

389
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:48,680
Who was he crazy with,
after you?

390
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,349
Judy Trahill in Radiology.

391
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:57,554
I'm a married woman.
Well, your husband
the jealous type?

392
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:00,322
If he cared enough about me
to kill, I wouldn't have
cheated on him.

393
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:03,694
Is that why Dr. KIeberg
cheated on his wife?
'Cause she didn't care enough?

394
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:07,360
Just the reverse.
She cared too much.
How do you do that?

395
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:08,993
During the two months
he was recuperating,

396
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,403
she nursed him, bathed him,
waited on him hand and foot.

397
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:15,671
He felt Iike an invalid.
The only thing he wanted
to do was Iive.

398
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:20,113
BENSON: So you two
did some Iiving.
One weekend. Six months ago.

399
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:23,082
Okay, so who was next
on his rounds?
A nurse in Neonatal,

400
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:25,984
but it was over before
anything really happened.

401
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:27,487
CIinical exhaustion.

402
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:30,683
Peyton made a surprise visit,
caught them flirting.

403
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,489
STABLER: What'd she do?
Bitch-slapped the nurse.

404
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:37,693
So the doctor has an operation
where they apparently give him
a wandering heart,

405
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:40,894
after which he sows
the gross national product
in wild oats.

406
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:42,800
Two months and then
the trail stops cold.

407
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:44,065
Think he mended
his evil ways?

408
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:46,630
I think after his close call,
he Iearned
how to cover his tracks.

409
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,734
Speaking of tracks,
we've been following
the wrong one.

410
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:53,042
Jesse all too willingly
volunteered a DNA sample.

411
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:54,547
He's not our guy.

412
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:56,914
FIN: CIose the door
and open the window.

413
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:58,782
LUDs to the doctor's
cell phone

414
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:01,515
and Iast month,
he got about 1,000 minutes
to one number.

415
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,524
Lara Todd.
Boss's secretary.

416
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:07,186
She told us their affair
ended months ago,
just Iike the others.

417
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:10,789
Well, I doubt
he was calling her at home
for urine results.

418
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:12,389
Go talk to her.

419
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:17,393
Ten will get you 20
if she claims he just called
to cry on her shoulder.

420
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:19,303
Good friends, my ass.

421
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,476
That's blood, OIivia.

422
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:28,981
It's fresh.

423
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:32,852
Door's open.

424
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:45,959
Lara?

425
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,599
Lara, you in there?

426
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,374
Oh, my God!

427
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,138
(GROANING)

428
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:10,515
Hey.

429
00:23:14,229 --> 00:23:15,753
How you doing?

430
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,325
I've been better.

431
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:23,132
Lara, do you know
who did this to you?
No.

432
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:26,633
Can you describe him at all?

433
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:34,006
I don't know.
I never saw his face.
He was wearing a mask.

434
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,449
Tell me what happened.

435
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:43,718
I was just coming in
the door from work,

436
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:47,558
and he pushed in
behind me.

437
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,089
I closed my eyes

438
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:55,728
and tried to go someplace else
and when he finished,

439
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:59,331
I thought, "Thank God,
I got through it."

440
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:05,236
But then he came back
in the room
and started again.

441
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,183
Lara, if you want us
to catch him,

442
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,116
you're gonna have to be
straight with me.

443
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:15,816
I'm not making this up.
I was raped!
I know that.

444
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,187
I'm talking about
seeing Dr. KIeberg.

445
00:24:26,668 --> 00:24:32,664
I knew the papers would
add it to the story
and make him seem all sleazy,

446
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,265
and he deserved
better than that.

447
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,573
Does his wife know
about you?

448
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,580
Not until the very end.

449
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:44,213
She showed up
at my apartment building

450
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,685
and said that if I didn't stop
seeing Max,

451
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:49,314
she would ruin both our Iives.

452
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,415
And when was this?

453
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:53,961
Three days before
Max was killed.

454
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,493
We might have a problem
with Peyton.

455
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:02,593
Peyton the rape victim?
BENSON:
Peyton the wronged wife.

456
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,400
She'd just found out
that Max was still seeing
Lara Todd.

457
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:07,498
Tracked her down
and threatened her.
Crime of passion.

458
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:10,100
I could buy it
if Mrs. KIeberg
hadn't been bound,

459
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:11,941
gagged and raped
for over two hours.

460
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,344
Let's not forget
the Miller case.

461
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:16,076
Phony rape
at the Thorpe Palace
so she could sue the hotel.

462
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,176
Dr. KIeberg and his mistress
were beaten to a pulp.

463
00:25:19,254 --> 00:25:21,518
Peyton suffered
only relatively minor battery.

464
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,386
Which is odd,
it being the same perp.

465
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,222
Lara's rape kit
isn't back yet.
How do we know for sure?

466
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:29,127
The crime Iab compared
the scenes and found cat hairs
on all the victims.

467
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:31,461
The color patterns
are consistent with a tabby.

468
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:34,161
Great. So we're Iooking
for a guy with a cat?

469
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:36,396
AII right. Has any of
Peyton's jewelry

470
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,564
surfaced at
any of the pawn shops
we've checked?

471
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,868
FIN: Not a blip.

472
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:42,671
Well, this is heirloom stuff,
right? Very distinctive.

473
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:46,441
But if she staged this
as a robbery,
she probably still has it.

474
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:47,981
Well, her apartment
is still a crime scene.

475
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,414
Why don't we just go
poke around?

476
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:51,748
Because the type of attorney
Mrs. KIeberg can afford

477
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,377
would have anything
we found there thrown out

478
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:54,682
before his morning
squash game.

479
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:57,190
We do this one by the book.
We don't have enough
for a warrant.

480
00:25:57,258 --> 00:26:01,251
So we go fishing.
Have Cabot pull his financials
and grab a pole.

481
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,933
THURMAN: These are all
their accounts and holdings.
MUNCH: Thanks.

482
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:10,937
The worst things happen
to the best people.

483
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,233
FIN: You knew the KIebergs?

484
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,935
Peyton and I sit on a few
of the same committees.

485
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,536
PIease Iet me know
if there's anything
I can do to help.

486
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:22,881
She has a safety deposit box.
Maybe she stashed
the jewelry in there.

487
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:24,578
Subpoena doesn't
cover that.

488
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:26,620
Excuse me, Mrs. Thurman?
Yes?

489
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,679
Do you keep an entry Iog
for the safe deposit boxes?

490
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:29,745
Yes, of course.

491
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:31,951
Could you check and see
when the KIeberg's
was opened Iast?

492
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,995
I don't have to.
Peyton was in a few days
before it happened.

493
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:36,052
For what?

494
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,567
She took out
her Tiffany diamond necklace
and ring. Stunning.

495
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:42,466
Has she been here since?
No.

496
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:44,437
How do you know
what she took out?
We talked.

497
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:47,497
Max wanted her to wear it
to the Fire and Ice Ball
next week.

498
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:49,008
Really?
Yeah. It's so sad.

499
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:53,343
It was going to be
their first major event
together since his surgery.

500
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:58,951
I don't get it.
If she was planning this,
why take the jewelry out?

501
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,113
Ever hear of
insurance fraud?
She's stinking rich.

502
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:03,487
Even before her husband died,
all the money was in her name.

503
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:04,923
You can never be
too thin or too rich.

504
00:27:04,993 --> 00:27:07,587
Especially when you take out
chunks Iike that.

505
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:11,291
$10,000, eight days
before it happened.
In cash.

506
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:12,663
Could be enough
for a hit man.

507
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:15,703
Let's just hope it's enough
for a warrant.

508
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:19,703
Detectives. Come in.

509
00:27:19,774 --> 00:27:21,901
This is a warrant allowing us
to search your apartment.

510
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:24,171
A warrant?
Why do you need to
search my home?

511
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:26,042
I'm sorry.
I have to ask you
not to disturb anything.

512
00:27:26,114 --> 00:27:28,844
But I don't understand.
What are you Iooking for?

513
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:32,010
Stay with Mrs. KIeberg
until we're through.
Thank you.

514
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:39,115
Hey. Breadbox rule.
They Iook so happy.

515
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:41,593
If a container
could not possibly hold
the item in question,

516
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:44,154
you are prohibited
from examining it.
This is Iast New Year's.

517
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:45,893
Do any marriages Iast?

518
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:48,697
I don't know,
but the warrant
only covers jewelry.

519
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,829
God, you've been married
for 17 years, haven't you?

520
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:52,031
Stop.
Sorry.

521
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:53,903
No, stop Iooking.

522
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:00,774
Try smoking this.

523
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,441
We're going this way,
Mrs. KIeberg.

524
00:28:13,928 --> 00:28:16,192
What is that woman doing here?

525
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:20,132
Did I do okay?
You did great.

526
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,431
She Iooks crazy, didn't she?

527
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:31,071
They stormed into my home,
tore it apart.

528
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:35,775
I apologize if you
or your property were
in any way mistreated.

529
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,648
They treated me
Iike a criminal!

530
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,415
If you were almost
anybody else,

531
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:43,548
you would have been arrested
for insurance fraud
on the spot.

532
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:46,058
Let's just clear things up.
Okay.

533
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,928
How did your jewelry wind up
in the cigar box?

534
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:51,692
I don't know.

535
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:55,031
You'II excuse my being blunt,
but that really doesn't
clear up anything at all.

536
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:58,266
I don't know how it got there.
But it's my jewelry.

537
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,170
Why is it any concern
of yours?

538
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,709
It became our concern
when you filed a false claim.

539
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:04,972
I didn't file a claim
for anything.

540
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:07,207
Our business manager
takes care of those things.

541
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,339
Mrs. KIeberg...

542
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,907
And I don't understand
why Lara Todd
is sitting out there.

543
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:12,509
She was raped.

544
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:17,689
We believe by the same man
who raped you
and killed your husband.

545
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,885
What?

546
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:24,053
You withdrew $10,000
on the 23rd.

547
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:25,724
Can you tell me
what that was for?

548
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:31,367
Even for you,
that's a Iarge sum of money.
Why did you need it in cash?

549
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,236
So Max wouldn't know.

550
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,372
Wouldn't know what?

551
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:39,472
(SIGHS)

552
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,107
That I hired
a private investigator.

553
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:48,250
How do you think
I found out about Lara?

554
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:53,658
MUNCH: Ken Voltz?

555
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,100
You're blocking
my Iine of vision.

556
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:03,069
Where's your manners?
Aren't you
gonna invite us in?

557
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:08,768
Look, I'm on the clock.
Everything I had on the case
is in there.

558
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:11,141
You, by any chance,
own a cat, Mr. Voltz?

559
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:12,873
Two dogs, Jack Russells.

560
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,778
We were wondering
if Mrs. KIeberg didn't maybe

561
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:17,818
have a second job for you,
night of the 23rd?

562
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:22,254
I don't eliminate husbands,
I just put them
in piping hot water.

563
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:26,157
FIN: You can account for
your whereabouts that night
between 8:00 and 10:00?

564
00:30:26,227 --> 00:30:29,993
I was following a guy
out to a Iittle Iove nest
in Jersey.

565
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:33,227
I keep toll receipts
for tax purposes
if you'd Iike them.

566
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:34,928
How Iong were you on KIeberg?

567
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:39,132
Two weeks.
Two days said it all,
but I Iike to be thorough.

568
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:42,509
Oh, damn it,
almost missed my guy.

569
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,204
(CLICKING)

570
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:49,142
Got a guy in the background
of two of these.
Different Iocations.

571
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:53,744
He's eyeballing Max.
Like he's tracking him.

572
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,952
BENSON: Have you seen
this man before?

573
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,488
It's Vincent.

574
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:06,090
Is he a friend of yours?
No, he Iives right below me
in 4B.

575
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:10,228
Why do you have his picture?
He just came up
during the investigation.

576
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:14,866
He a violent guy?
Vincent? No, he's harmless.

577
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:20,071
Maybe harmless Vincent
isn't as harmless as he Iooks.

578
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:23,981
We've been thinking
Lara was attacked because of
her relationship with Max.

579
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:27,680
Now maybe Max was murdered
because of
his connection to Lara.

580
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,588
She said the apartment
right under hers.

581
00:31:32,894 --> 00:31:34,657
She said 4B, right?

582
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,692
Vincent.

583
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,765
Yeah?
Hey, what's your name?

584
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:43,326
Chloe, get back inside.

585
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:46,737
That's a cute cat.
Could we ask you
a few questions?

586
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:49,833
No.

587
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:59,709
CRAGEN: Vincent Boyd is
a former guest of the state.
Robbery and assault.

588
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:03,348
He Iives directly
below Lara Todd,
our second rape victim.

589
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:06,290
FIN: Who was the mistress
of the Iate Dr. KIeberg.

590
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,225
BENSON:
Husband to rape victim
number one.

591
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:11,595
STABLER: Peyton, the one
with motive but no direct
connection to Vincent.

592
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,863
Well, we do have Peyton
in Lara's building,
also Vincent's building,

593
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:16,164
three days before the murder.

594
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:18,364
So what,
she bumps into him
on the elevator

595
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,907
and hires him
to off her husband
and mess up the mistress?

596
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:24,638
Well, the rape kits came back.
The same man who raped Lara
raped Peyton.

597
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:26,612
AII right, Iet's set Peyton
aside for a minute, here.

598
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:30,276
Is there any chance that
there was a relationship
between Lara and Vincent?

599
00:32:30,351 --> 00:32:31,909
Well, she says that
she barely knew him.

600
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:33,578
But, you know,
only to pass in the hall.

601
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:35,315
Could've been
a committed relationship
in his mind.

602
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:37,323
How many times have we seen
that behavior with stalkers?

603
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,325
Vincent sees the doctor
making house calls,

604
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,384
thinks he's been wronged
and seeks revenge.

605
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,191
Yeah.
And Peyton gets caught
in the crossfire.

606
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,391
So what about the food
at the KIebergs? Right?

607
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:47,525
Was there any DNA
from the saliva?

608
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:51,799
There wasn't any. Crime Iab
says he didn't take bites.
He tore pieces off.

609
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:53,134
Lot of arrows
you got up there.

610
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:56,233
FIN: But no way
to connect Vincent.

611
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,370
Well, you know
who does connect
with everybody?

612
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:01,674
CRAGEN: CIeo.

613
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:04,877
Tabby hairs were found
on all three victims.

614
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:08,115
And Vincent owns a tabby.
CABOT: Circumstantial.

615
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:10,749
You can't prove the hairs
came from Vincent's cat.

616
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:13,885
AII his attorney has to do
is parade 50 tabbies
through the courtroom.

617
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:15,087
He's still got
reasonable doubt.

618
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,323
Well, if we got the DNA
from the damn cat,

619
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:18,660
would that be enough
to get Vincent's?

620
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,668
Sure, but New York State
doesn't have
that kind of technology.

621
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:24,204
In fact,
I only know of two cases
in the entire United States

622
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:25,602
where they've used cat DNA.

623
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:28,073
What do you say
we make it three?

624
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,418
If Vincent comes back,
buzz us.
I don't see no cat.

625
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:41,319
That doesn't mean anything.
They're freaky
Iittle creatures. They Iurk.

626
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:43,983
Well, keep Iooking.
I'm gonna check in on Lara.

627
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:47,186
Here pussy, pussy, pussy.
You're kidding, right?

628
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:49,661
This is not
my area of expertise.

629
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:54,224
(CAT MEOWING)
Oh, come on.
Where is this cat?

630
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:58,260
There you are,
you demonic Iittle fur-ball.
Come here, sweetheart.

631
00:33:58,339 --> 00:33:59,772
That's a good kitty.

632
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,741
What happened?
Nothing.

633
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:08,805
Nothing.
Those are fresh bruises.
I'm fine, really.

634
00:34:08,883 --> 00:34:12,944
Lara, we know what's going on.
If you don't work with us,
we can't help you.

635
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,683
There's nothing
to help me with.
You were raped.

636
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:18,054
STABLER: Now we know
about Vincent.

637
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,820
Everywhere you go,
there he is.

638
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:22,192
BENSON:
He's very possessive,
isn't he?

639
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,396
Lara, we don't think
that you're safe here.

640
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:28,367
Is there anyone, anywhere
that you can stay?

641
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:32,967
No. I don't have anyone.

642
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:36,735
I know a women's shelter
near where you work.

643
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:38,802
I'm gonna take you there.
Okay?

644
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:44,877
Okay.

645
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:50,414
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Are you the zoological
geneticist?
This had been a royal pain.

647
00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:55,325
Do you realize
we had to have
special panels FedExed

648
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:57,023
from a genomic Iab
in Maryland?

649
00:34:57,098 --> 00:35:00,898
No, but we appreciate it.
Are we close?
AImost.

650
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,401
But you will be able
to tell us today

651
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,028
whether or not the hairs
came from CIeo?

652
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:06,767
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?
For starters, it's a cat.

653
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:09,071
So right there,
we're not using the standard
13-marker test.

654
00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:11,077
So you can't get it?

655
00:35:11,145 --> 00:35:13,340
No, I got it. It's your cat.

656

Go ahead.

659
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:36,297
STABLER: Lara?

660
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,203
Just put down the gun, honey.
Put down the gun.

661
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:42,208
I shot him.
BENSON: I see can that, Lara.

662
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:44,244
I just need you
to hand me that gun,
all right?

663
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,836
I had to. He wouldn't stop.

664
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:50,145
It's okay now.
Lara, the gun, all right?

665
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:54,213
Got it?

Ruger P94.

667
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:09,361
I moved in three years ago
all by myself.

668
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:12,362
I didn't think I could
carry up one more box

669
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:15,465
when Vincent came over
and started helping me.

670
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,508
After that, he was just
always there.
It became romantic?

671
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:24,517
I told him
I just wanted to be friends,
but he was so persistent

672
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:27,816
and sweet. He wore me down.

673
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:30,947
He didn't stay too sweet.

674
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,488
I came home Iate
from work one day
and he'd burned my clothes.

675
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:39,465
Why?
He accused me of cheating.

676
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,899
Said I was a whore,
then started hitting me.

677
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,665
Why didn't you report him?

678
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:48,799
He apologized,
swore it would never
happen again,

679
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,607
promised to make it up to me.

680
00:36:53,948 --> 00:36:57,782
He said
I was the most beautiful girl
in the world.

681
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:59,876
But then he did it again.

682
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,722
I don't know how many times.

683

Were you two together
when you started seeing Max?

684

Vincent punished me
for two years of infidelities
I never committed.

685
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:14,660
I thanked God
when I found Max.

686
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,101
How'd Vincent feel
about that?

687
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:19,401
LARA:
He followed me everywhere.

688
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,766
He had a key.

689
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:27,803
He'd come into my apartment
in the middle of the night.

690
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:33,878
But I was finally
strong enough, because of Max,
to say no.

691

Why didn't you
get out of that building?

00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:49,825

that night and told me
we could be together again.

696
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:52,939

call the police?

698
00:37:57,511 --> 00:38:00,480
You don't know Vincent.
He'd kill me.

699
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:04,779
No matter where I went,
he would find me and kill me
Iike he killed Max.

700
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:07,047
You were at the shelter.
You were safe.

701
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:11,057
Why did you go back?
He was waiting for me
outside the shelter.

702
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,992
I couldn't believe
he found me there, too.

703
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:16,655
He must have followed us.

704
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,358
But I don't understand.
Why did you go
back to the apartment?

705
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:21,697
He forced me.

706
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:26,103
He started to rape me again,
and I couldn't
Iet it keep happening.

707
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:29,839
I made it to his gun

CABOT: Yeah,
but there's a hitch.

711
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:49,018
She's got the numbness,
the Iow self-esteem,
the fatalism,

712
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:51,826
and the physical injuries
kind of speak for themselves.

713
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:54,800
What's the hitch?
It's not clear-cut
self-defense.

714
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:56,836
She shot the man
that killed her Iover.

715
00:38:56,904 --> 00:38:59,737
A jury could very easily see
that as an act of revenge.

716
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:03,072
She was beaten,
raped and terrorized.

717
00:39:03,143 --> 00:39:05,168
In her mind
there was no escape.

718
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:07,770
Look, if she had shot him
in her own apartment
during the rape,

719
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,475
we wouldn't even have
to have this conversation.

720
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,145
As it stands now,
all we've got is he-said
she-said, he's dead.

721
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,085
Battered women
rarely report abuse.

722
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:18,989
They are conditioned
to believe that no one's
gonna help them.

723
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,687
Okay, I want to be
able to close this
in good conscience.

to find in here.

737
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:54,658
CSU's already been through it
with a microscope, Iiterally.

738
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:56,787
Diaries, journals,
pictures, Ietters.

739
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:58,764
Yeah, CSU would never Iook
for anything Iike that.

740
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:00,663
They missed this.

741
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:04,329
Triple-X porn.
How's that apply?
Open it up.

742
00:40:04,405 --> 00:40:07,340
Commercial jacket,
home-made video.
Bag it.

743
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:18,781
They said I had to
sign something?
Yeah. Come in.

744
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,748
This is the statement
you gave to police.

745
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:27,590
I just need you to review it,
make sure it's accurate
and sign it right there.

746
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:28,787
Okay.

747
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:39,996
Is that it?
No. Actually,
there's one more thing.

748
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,199
LARA: Sure.

749
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,713
Come on, Vincent,

750
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:51,046
If you won't do it for me,
do it for the $15,000,

751
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:54,087
That doctor's wife,
right?
So?

752
00:40:54,154 --> 00:40:56,179
Why don't you want
to be with me?

753
00:40:56,256 --> 00:41:00,659
Look, if you don't have
the balls to do it,,,
No, no, no,

754
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:02,752
No, I'll do it,
Good,

755
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:08,761
You need to be waiting
at his service door at 7:45,
Get there early,

756
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,532
You didn't know he made
that video, did you?

757
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,238
He Ioved you,
but he didn't trust you.

758
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:26,082
I was in Iove with Max.
Vincent was only supposed
to kill Peyton.

759
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:31,087
There never was any
relationship with Vincent,
was there?

760
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:34,286
He followed me around
Iike a puppy dog.

761
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:37,228
He'd do anything for me,
but he wasn't supposed
to kill Max.

762
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:40,198
Why did you stage
your own rape?
I didn't.

763
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:43,566
Once he killed Max,
he owned me.
I couldn't go to the police.

764
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:45,195
Rape by blackmail?

765
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:48,173
Do you have any idea
how horrible it was?

766
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:50,472
A jealous psychopath killed
the Iove of my Iife,

767
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:51,943
and I couldn't even
go to the police!

768
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,071
Sweetheart, the reason that
you couldn't go to the police

769
00:41:54,147 --> 00:41:55,614
is because you're the one
that hired him.

770
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:57,479
That wasn't my idea.

771
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,245
Where do you think
I got the $15,000?

772
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:03,949
And who do you think
hid the jewelry?

773
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:06,457
It was Max.

774
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:11,258
Once Peyton was dead,
he was gonna marry me.

775
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:20,971
How could Max be
with somebody Iike that?

776
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:26,240
It was the heart attack.
It changed him.

777
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:31,306
But things were finally
getting back to normal.

778
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:34,320
He broke it off with her
after I found out.

779
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:38,820
That's why she had him killed,
isn't it?

780
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:42,152
Mrs. KIeberg...

781
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,057
I'm so sorry,
but your husband planned
this whole thing.

782
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:50,901
Oh, that doesn't
make any sense.

783
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,598
Why would Max set up
his own death?
He wasn't supposed to die.

784
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:59,073
You were.
