00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:00,430
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,503 --> 00:00:04,132
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,332
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:08,343
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:12,005
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:13,605
These are their stories,

7
00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:18,886
Hey, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Let's go someplace else.

8
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:20,752
I got a better place. Come on.

9
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:24,923
Where you take
all your other girls?

10
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:28,191
Come on now. You know
I don't have nobody but you.

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,227
What's over here?
The view is better.

12
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:42,843
What's that?

13
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:47,713
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Relax. Come on now.
Relax. It's nothing.

14
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:53,550
I hear footsteps.

15
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:56,456
Look, I don't hear nothing.
What's up?
Do you want me or not?

16
00:00:56,526 --> 00:00:58,016
STABLER: We want you, Leon.

17
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:01,029
Who's that?
TATE: Oh, man,
that's the sex police.

18
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:03,492
Why they want you?

19
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:06,330
It's this cop, man.
He got this thing for me
or something Iike that.

20
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:09,565
Not even out of prison
two weeks. I told you
he's not gonna stop.

21
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:10,731
Over there.

22
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:11,899
BENSON: Come here.
What he do?

23
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:14,306
Come here with me.
I didn't do nothing, man.
He framed me.

24
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:16,242
Keep right on
thinking that, Leon.
What'd he do?

25
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:17,973
How old are you?
Fourteen.

26
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:19,480
Oh, you's a Iying bitch.

27
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,040
Yo, man, Nashika told me
she graduated high school.

28
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:23,813
Yo, tell them
I ain't forced you.

29
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:25,649
I wanted to be with him.
Okay.

30
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:28,281
The Iaw says
you're not old enough
to make that decision.

31
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:31,258
Now, was he gonna
use protection?
We didn't talk about it.

32
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:34,319
I bet he didn't even mention
that he's HIV positive,
did he?

33
00:01:34,397 --> 00:01:36,627
Bastard has the virus? Man!

34
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:37,757
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,802
Nashika, come here.
Settle, settle, settle.

36
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,268
Yo, man,
you can't give that up.

37
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:43,862
I just did. What are you
gonna do about it?

38
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:48,009
Look at me. It's okay.
Nashika, have you ever
had sex with him?

39
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:54,206
Tonight would have been
the first time.

40
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:56,274
Okay, Iet's go.

41
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:49,603
So how many Iittle girls
have you had sex with
since you been out?

42
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,333
Yo, man, you ain't
have no right to follow me.

43
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:55,104
Hey. Hey. Don't tell me
how to do my job.
Answer the question.

44
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:57,840
So you can put me away
again for nothing?

45
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:00,883
Man, Iisten, the young Iadies
feel me, it's not my fault.

46
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,611
It is if they're jailbait.

47
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:04,676
They want to pleasure me,
who am I to stop them?

48
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:07,746
And if you infect them with
your HIV, it's their problem,
too, right?

49
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:11,725
Look, man, you ambushed us
before I even had
an opportunity to tell her.

50
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:13,352
I had protection.

51
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:16,159
Her protection is
me putting you back
in your Iittle cage.

52
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:21,433
Why don't you
just get off my case, man?
'Cause I don't Iike you.

53
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:29,606
AII right, well, I don't
have nothing else to say
until my Iegal aid gets here.

54
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:34,782
I'm surprised he said
as much as he did.

55
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,841
He has the personality
of a repeater.

56
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,752
He can do no wrong.
Nothing is his fault.

57
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,124
CABOT:
What was he in prison for?
Five years, sodomy two.

58
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:44,887
After I finally convinced

59
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:47,521
one of the numerous
underage girls
he had oral sex with

60
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:48,996
to come forward
and file a complaint.

61
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:52,000
Now he's escalating
to intercourse.
You're speculating, EIIiot.

62
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,502
He wasn't in the act
when you stopped him.
That's a problem.

63
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,368
Attempted rape two,
attempted reckless
endangerment,

64
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,568
because he didn't disclose
that he was HIV positive.

65
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:01,803
Where's the problem here?

66
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:03,845
We can't hold him
based on what he might do.

67
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:06,143
So we're supposed to wait
until after he infects
the girl?

68
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:07,477
She consented.

69
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,280
His attorney will say he was
carrying condoms
and planned to use them.

70
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:11,479
We can't prove otherwise.

71
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:16,116
We know that Leon
was about to have
unprotected sex with a minor.

72
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,922
Now, we cut him Ioose,
he's going to.

73
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:22,863
You got anything in your bag
of tricks, Counselor, now is
the time to pull it out.

74
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,661
I have something,
but I'II have to check.

75
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:27,760
And I'II have to involve
your psychiatrist.
I'II give him a call.

76
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:31,136
Get him Tate's prison
history, arrest records,
whatever you could find.

77
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,698
Leon's rap sheet starts
when he was seven years old.

78
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,767
He had 1 1 arrests
by his 13th birthday.

79
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:37,938
The record was sealed
because he was a juvenile.

80
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:39,982
Let's get them unsealed.

81
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:46,253
EIIiot, close the door.

82
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,051
Yeah?

83
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:55,529
I don't remember telling you
to tail Leon Tate.

84
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,425
I heard he was out.
Just keeping my eye on him.

85
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:01,970
Well, this squad doesn't have
enough bodies

86
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:04,336
for you and your partner
to go freelancing.

87
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:09,874
I Iike to think that we saved
a young girl's Iife tonight.

88
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:13,346
And we would need a new unit
if we were to follow
every perv

89
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,509
that we thought might repeat.

90
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,279
Leon Tate did his time.

91
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:20,117
And until somebody
makes a complaint,
he has rights.

92
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,420
This guy's penis is a deadly
weapon and he's got
a thing for young girls.

93
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:24,686
They got rights, too.

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,163
Until Cabot gives us
the word, you back off.
Are we clear?

95
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,600
We can't charge Leon Tate
with a crime,

96
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,696
so you wanna Iock him up
in a mental institution?

97
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:40,503
The Supreme Court
in Kansas v, Hendricks
upheld States' rights

98
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:42,771
to commit sexual predators
after their prison sentences.

99
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:46,281
Yes, Kansas and 16
other states have Iaws
specifically for that purpose.

100
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,782
New York does not.

101
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,011
We can use the existing
mental hygiene Iaw.

102
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:52,384
AII we have to do is
prove Leon Tate
has a mental illness

103
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:55,356
that poses a Iikelihood
of danger to himself
or to others.

104
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:59,224
You really want to risk
trying to set a precedent
with this case?

105
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:01,763
Leon Tate is a
sexual predator with HIV.

106
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:03,458
I think we have
a responsibility

107
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:06,296
to protect people from him
and others Iike him.

108
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:07,859
AII right. You give me
something to work with.

109
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:10,497
I'II see if the D.A.
will go for it.

110
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:15,601
Problem is even if the woman
Iies about her age,
it's still the man's fault.

111
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:17,009
Ignorance is no defense.

112
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,571
Nashika Morris is 14.
She's not a woman,
she's a girl.

113
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:23,174
What's a guy supposed to do,
check the girl's
birth certificate?

114
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:25,686
I'm just as opposed to rape
as everybody else
in this room,

115
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,417
but if she wanted to have sex,
that's her choice.
She wasn't forced.

116
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,789
She's a minor.
What she wants isn't relevant.

117
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,387
Are we interrupting?
Friendly disagreement.
Care to join in?

118
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:37,023
I came to tell you
that the D.A.'s allowing us
to move on Leon Tate.

119
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,191
On what grounds?

120
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:41,031
Based upon the reports
that I've read, I think
that I can make a case

121
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:43,936
that Mr. Tate has
anti-social personality
disorder.

122
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:45,234
That's what I've been
saying all along.

123
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:47,275
No empathy, no conscience,

124
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:49,607
no thought for the possible
consequences of his actions.

125
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:52,579
So he knows
what he's doing is wrong.
And he doesn't care.

126
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:56,744
Most people with HIV
act responsibly when it comes
to practicing safe sex.

127
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,947
Tate either can't control
or won't control his impulses,

128
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:01,614
which make him
a repeat sex offender.

129
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,420
Yeah, he's a sexual predator.
Now he's definitely
a danger to others.

130
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,290
Which is the standard set
by the Supreme Court.

131
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:08,830
HUANG: Do we know
how he contracted HIV?
Yeah, shooting dope.

132
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:10,832
He found out
when he was tested in prison.

133
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,460
One fix wipes away
any self-control
that Tate has Ieft,

134
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:16,096
making him even more Iikely
to have unprotected sex
with a minor.

135
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,571
And this is already
in the works?

136
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,040
We argue the motion
for a commitment hearing
this afternoon.

137
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:21,701
It would be a big help
if you could be there

138
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:23,904
in case the judge
has questions
about Tate's past.

139
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:25,879
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

140
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:32,152
REGAL: Your Honor,
it's double jeopardy
disguised as treatment.

141
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:34,052
CABOT: Supreme Court
Kansas v, Hendricks,

142
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:36,887
civil commitment
of a sexual predator
is not punitive.

143
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,325
They arrested Mr. Tate
and couldn't make
the charges stick,

144
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:42,023
so they put a Iabel on him
for a one-way trip
to the funny farm.

145
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,156
I get the point, Ms. Regal.

146
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:46,196
ELMORE: Doctor Huang.
Yes?

147
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:49,294
Other than an
anti-social personality,

148
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:53,671
did you find any evidence
that the defendant
has a sexual disorder?

149
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:54,934
Yes.

150
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:58,502
Mr. Tate expresses his
narcissism and his anger
by having unprotected sex

151
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:02,677
with underage, powerless girls
and not disclosing
that he's HIV positive.

152
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,982
Detective Stabler,
when you arrested Mr. Tate,
how did you know for certain

153
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,319
that he was going
to have sex with the girl?

154
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,618
Ms. Morris told us so.

155
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,523
We found condoms on Tate
when we searched him.

156
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:16,128
Well, wouldn't that indicate
that Mr. Tate
planned safe sex?

157
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:18,462
Even so, the girl's a minor.
That's rape two.

158
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:21,332
Your Honor, Detective Stabler
can in no way predict
what my client

159
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:22,768
may or may not
have done that night.

160
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:25,398
Your client Iikes Iittle girls
and if we don't stop him now,

161
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:27,908
he's gonna kill one of them.
Enough.

162
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:32,870
I agree something
has to be done about
repeat sexual offenders,

163
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:36,912
but I am not gonna put
this man through a civil
commitment hearing

164
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:41,252
unless you can prove
that his intent was
unprotected sex.

165
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:43,985
Judge was afraid
to stick her neck out.

166
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:47,722
Maybe she'II change her mind
when we wheel a body
into her chambers.

167
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:49,889
Who's catching?
That would be me. What's up?

168
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:54,595
Rape. Rooftop in Harlem,
15-year-old victim
at Metro Hospital's ER.

169
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,468
It's Tate's m.o.
We'II take it.
Be my guest.

170
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,271
EIIiot, I've got two days
to finish up the paperwork
on the Wilson case

171
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:02,776
or I'm in contempt of court.

172
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:04,608
I'II go.
CRAGEN: AII right.

173
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:09,050
I don't want you trying
to pin Tate to every
sex crime in Harlem.

174
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:17,716
I met him in the park
down the block
from our apartment.

175
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:22,759
He told me he could get me
a rap audition,
that he was a promoter.

176
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,457
I fell for it.

177
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,694
Shareen, it's not your fault.

178
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,797
Did he tell you his name?
Andre.

179
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,967
He seemed nice.

180
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:39,369
Said I was smart and talented.

181
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,672
What happened?

182
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:45,382
He took me out
to a real restaurant.

183
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:50,216
Then he walked me home.
When we got to my door,

184
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:55,759
he said it was a beautiful
night, and that I was
aglow Iike the stars,

185
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:58,832
that we should go
to the rooftop.

186
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:03,369
He started to kiss me.
I told him to stop.

187
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:05,796
He slapped me,

188
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:10,442
pulled a knife,
ripped off my clothes,

189
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:14,306
and then he...

190
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,211
(CRYING)

191
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,718
Did he say anything
during the attack?

192
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:28,761
That I was Iucky
to experience him
'cause he was so handsome.

193
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:31,933
He was the Iove machine,

194
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,966
and that he was gonna make me
into a woman when he was done.

195
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:43,640
We'II be right back.

196
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:48,315
She's got a detached retina,
concussion.

197
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,776
Basically, he used her face
for a punching bag.

198
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:53,378
Okay, tell the doctor
that the rapist may have HIV.

199
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:55,286
Okay. Where are you going?

200
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:56,346
Back to the office.

201
00:10:56,425 --> 00:11:00,657
That "Iove machine" Iine?
I've heard it before.

202
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:06,160
In '93 right after I got here,
13-year-old rape victim
Vanessa Hiltz.

203
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:09,534
Perp said he was gonna
make a woman out of her,
that he was the Iove machine.

204
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:11,266
You get anywhere on the case?

205
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:14,604
Was gonna run the DNA in '95
when they first
started testing,

206
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:18,443
but back then you couldn't
get it done unless you
already had the collar.

207
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:20,641
And you think
Leon Tate is our guy.

208
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:23,412
I contacted the victim.
She's got AIDS.

209
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,017
Perp sweet-talked her
just Iike Leon.

210
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:28,885
I don't know how I missed it.

211
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:31,289
CRAGEN: Well, banging your
head against the wall
isn't gonna help.

212
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,262
Pick Tate up and see if
his victims are in any kind
of shape for a Iineup.

213
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:45,632
I pounded on his door.
If he's in there,
he's got a bad headache.

214
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,038
You okay?

215
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:54,609
Yeah. I just don't Iike
some guy making my home turf
dangerous for young girls.

216
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:59,318
I thought you grew up
in Brooklyn.
Nope. About 10 blocks
from here.

217
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,549
Ground zero for the '68 riots.

218
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:02,715
What was that Iike?

219
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,022
I was six. My mother said
the only way we're
Ieaving our apartment

220
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:08,029
was if somebody
burned it down.

221
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,224
This your guy?

222
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,067
Son of a bitch is at it again.

223
00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:15,431
You, come here.

224
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:17,438
Yo, come on, man.
Yo, she's 17.
checked her ID.

225
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:18,666
We didn't do nothing.

226
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:19,730
Assume the position.

227
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:22,538
See how they do?
So what's up, man?
The hood got you scared,

228
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,875
you had to bring
Uncle Tom with you?
You didn't mean that.

229
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,505
You know something?
I think you just
upset my partner.

230
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:28,607
You should apologize.
Yeah, go ahead with...

231
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:30,811
AII right, all right,
all right. I apologize,
I apologize.

232
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:33,218
You know Casanova here
has HIV?

233
00:12:34,156 --> 00:12:36,317
That the truth?
Yo, man, don't believe them.

234
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:39,292
No. Is it the truth?
Yo, I got protection.

235
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,994
I don't care if you got
a bulletproof vest
for that thing.

236
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,258
You should have told me.

237
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:44,424
Oh, now there she go.

238
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,866
Yo, man, my Iegal aid told me
I can sue you
for telling anybody.

239
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:48,163
Yeah, so go ahead and do it.

240
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:50,637
We'II say it slipped out
while we busted you
for rape and assault.

241
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:51,900
Do what?
Yo, I ain't raped nobody.

242
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:53,669
Yeah, I'II bet you're not
the Iove machine, either.

243
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:56,210
Yo, man, what you
talking about, man?
Why y'all doing this to me?

244
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:59,213
"Doing it to me."
It's all about you, huh, Leon?

245
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,077
It's been a while.

246
00:13:03,952 --> 00:13:05,681
It's okay, Vanessa.

247
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:08,748
Do you recognize
any of these men?

248
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,294
I'm not sure.

249
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:19,495
Take your time.
No coaching, Counselor.

250
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:29,370
I wish I could tell you
one of them's him. I'm sorry.

251
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:33,948
It's all right. It's
all right. It's all right.
Okay. Come on. Thank you.

252
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:35,074
(CRYING)

253
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:50,996
Okay, you ready?
They can't see you.
They can't see you.

254
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,260
Help me up.
Yeah. Come on.

255
00:14:05,113 --> 00:14:07,547
STABLER: Do you recognize
any of these men?

256
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,289
CABOT: Which one?

257
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,659
I can't tell.

258
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,696
(CRYING)

259
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:32,132
Maybe when I can see
a Iittle better.

260
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,306
Okay.

261
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:37,100
It's all right.

262
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:42,951
I'm taking my client home now.

263
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:52,516
Cut him Ioose.

264
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:55,721
That son of a bitch
wins again.

265
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:07,402
I'm on my way home
and this flaming shoe
hit the ground.

266
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:09,910
I Iook up and here comes
the rest of her.

267
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:11,605
Did you see
anyone else up there?

268
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,944
No, man, I was busy
putting out the fire.

269
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:17,042
Okay, thank you.
If you remember anything
else, give us a call.

270
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,211
They wake you up, too?

271
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:20,448
Yeah. I was just
Ieaving the office
when the call came in.

272
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:23,457
I had the desk page you.
Girl on a rooftop.
I figured you'd want in.

273
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,549
What's with fire?

274
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:27,060
Perp Iit the victim up
before he threw her off.

275
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,187
Who is she?

276
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,163
Aisha Thompson, 14.

277
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,427
Used to Iive about
two blocks away from here.

278
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:36,335
Tosses her off a roof.
Leon's trying to send me
a message now?

279
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:37,527
Hey.

280
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:41,098
Full thickness burns
to the body, but she was
dead before he torched her.

281
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:42,200
How?

282
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:46,043
Ligature strangulation
after she performed
oral sex on him.

283
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:49,146
We ran the Luma Light
around the scene,
she has fluids on her face.

284
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:50,684
Leon Iives
a dozen blocks from here.

285
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:52,583
THOMPSON: Where is she?
Where is she, man?

286
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:55,088
Hold up.
Yo, she's my sister.

287
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,091
Let him through.
Let him through.
Let him through.

288
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,491
Didn't know you had a sister.

289
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:04,258
Rodney. Rodney. Come on.
AII right.

290
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,961
You know him?
He Iooks
just Iike his father.

291
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:17,635
You used to come around
all the time
when I was a kid.

292
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:20,113
You know, your parents and I
got busy with our Iives,

293
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:22,582
fell out of touch
when I moved to Brooklyn.

294
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:24,575
How they doing?

295
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:30,456
Dad got hooked on dope,
disappeared,
and mom brought us up,

296
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:33,494
but she died two years ago,
breast cancer,

297
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:35,792
so it was just me and Aisha.

298
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,893
I was out all night
Iooking for her.

299
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,438
When did you realize
she was missing?

300
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,875
She went to the Iibrary
to do a project for school,

301
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:54,541
but when she didn't come home
by 10:00, I just started
calling her friends,

302
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:56,946
but nobody saw her, so...

303
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:02,450
Did she have a boyfriend?
Anybody paying
attention to her?

304
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:10,829
Aisha told me everything,
okay.

305
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:15,799
She just got accepted
to Stuyvesant. You know, that
school for the gifted kids?

306
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,205
She was gonna be somebody.

307
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,947
What are you gonna
do about this?

308
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:39,927
We got a Iine on this guy.
We think we know who he is

309
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:44,892
and we're gonna get him.
He's not gonna kill
any more girls.

310
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,068
How does Fin know
the victim's family?

311
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,630
He grew up with Rodney
and Aisha's mother.

312
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,676
This has got Tate
written all over it.

313
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:57,735
We need a warrant
for his apartment.

314
00:17:57,813 --> 00:17:59,144
CABOT: Do you have evidence
it was him?

315
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:01,648
We believe he beat up
Shareen White
when he raped her.

316
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:03,775
Maybe this time
he didn't wanna Ieave
any witnesses.

317
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:05,342
It's not enough.
And he's missing

318
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,651
and the victim fits Tate's
profile and she was raped
on that rooftop.

319
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:11,920
And murdered and set on fire,
neither of which
Tate has ever done.

320
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,621
We don't know everything
Leon Tate's done.

321
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:16,994
Now, how are we doing
on getting his records
unsealed?

322
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:18,828
Motion's in, but it's gonna
take some time.

323
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,425
We don't have time.
We need the information now.

324
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:24,965
Corporation counsel
would have prosecuted Tate
because he was a juvie.

325
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,507
Maybe somebody there
remembers him.

326
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:32,912
I keep my notes
on all my own cases.

327
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:34,039
The day I start this job,

328
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:37,745
they put that Iittle bastard's
overstuffed file
right on my desk.

329
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,344
Our shrink pegged him
with anti-social
personality disorder.

330
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:44,188
Yeah, well, that sounds mild
compared to the psych
evals I read back then.

331
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:47,786
Said Iittle Leon
was a serial killer
in the making.

332
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:49,056
Based on what?

333
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:52,100
Based on his Iove
of torturing and killing
the neighbors' pets.

334
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,863
Two when he was just seven,
and that's just for starters.

335
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,403
FIN: What happened?

336
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:59,304
Kiddie probation.
In other words, nothing.

337
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:01,535
My Iuck I got a judge
sympathetic to the kid.

338
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,237
His sheet says he was back
six months Iater.

339
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:05,006
Hey, I argued
he should be put away,

340
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,414
but Judge BIeeding Heart
wanted me to exhaust every
possible treatment option.

341
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:12,453
Don't tell me, His Honor said
Leon could be rehabilitated?

342
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:16,423
Until his Iast arrest,
which I handled
five years Iater.

343
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,219
What made the judge
change his mind?

344
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:23,321
Leon torched
the treatment facility.
Nobody else would touch him.

345
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:26,891
Leon set fires?

346
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:31,335
Nine out of his 11 collars
are for arson.

347
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:36,271
The ACC who prosecuted says
Tate told the psychiatrists

348
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,312
he killed puppies
to see what it felt Iike.

349
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,506
Add the pyromania

350
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:42,550
and Leon scores
two out of three
on the triad of sociopathy.

351
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:44,346
Bed-wetting would make him
three for three.

352
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:48,287
So Tate shows a reckless
disregard for Iife from
the time he was seven.

353
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:51,348
And he had five years to
think about what he was gonna
do when he got out.

354
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:53,519
So why didn't he kill
the first girl he seduced?

355
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:56,689
HUANG: Rape is about anger,
but I'm not sure it's
the women that set him off.

356
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:59,598
I think following him
might have made his anger
boil over.

357
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:03,570
Oh, so Aisha Thompson's death
is our fault?

358
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:07,438
Well, that's the way he's
gonna play it every time
he kills, until you find him.

359
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,704
So we should have
just done nothing, right?

360
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:12,539
I'm profiling,
I'm not accusing.

361
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:14,138
CRAGEN: AII right,
where are we?

362
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:17,117
Three shifts on Leon's crib
around the clock,
no sign of him.

363
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,949
Tate have any friends
or relatives he might
be holed up with?

364
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:22,546
His mother moved
from the address in his file.

365
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:23,989
Nobody could tell us
where she went.

366
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,789
AII right. Well, Iet's
just check his phone records
from prison.

367
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:29,830
If you were away
for five years,
you'd call your mother, too.

368
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:31,889
If he's not with her,
have his building canvassed.

369
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,697
John, start pulling every rape
and sexual homicide of girls

370
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:37,135
that fit the type Tate Iiked.
AII five boroughs.

371
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:38,229
How far back?

372
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:40,001
Let's start with 10 years.

373
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:41,872
This guy is
serial killer material.

374
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:45,003
He might have sweet-talked
a Iot more girls
than we know about.

375
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,709
You come to take
another five years
from my son?

376
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:52,878
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

377
00:20:52,954 --> 00:20:55,479
You should know,
the way you've been
following him around.

378
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:56,819
Mrs. Tate,
when was the Iast time...

379
00:20:56,925 --> 00:21:01,453
You sent him to prison
because some 14-year-old
hussy told him she was 21.

380
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:04,932
So it was her fault?
Girl never Ied you on?

381
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,225
A girl was murdered
Iast night.

382
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:11,971
He didn't kill anybody.
I told him to stay away
from those girls.

383
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,667
Well, Leon's not taking
your advice,

384
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:16,540
because he was with one
when I saw him two nights ago.

385
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,205
I don't know
why he's the way he is.

386
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,746
I tried to raise him right,
gave him plenty of Iove.

387
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,255
Now he's got this HIV.

388
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:33,653
I don't know what happened.

389
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:40,229
Mrs. Tate,
if he contacts you...

390
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:43,135
I'm afraid that he is
shooting dope again.

391
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,336
Why do you think that?

392
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,331
He said you were dogging him,

393
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,470
and he wasn't sure
he could handle
going back to prison.

394
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:56,375
Did he tell you that
when you saw him?
Last night.

395
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:06,926
What do you want with me?
FIN: You seen Leon Tate?

396
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,690
I mind my own business.

397
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:11,698
Why don't you try
knocking on his door?
We did.

398
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,131
Then I guess I can't help you.

399
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:16,967
AII right. Well,
if you see him give me a call.

400
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:20,174
Where to now?

401
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:22,533
Well, Leon Iikes rooftops.

402
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:29,440
Spent a Iot of time
on my rooftop
when I was a kid.

403
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:31,417
It was safe back then.

404
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:33,545
Doing the wild thing
with your girlfriend?

405
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:36,146
You know, when you Iive here
you can't afford
a vacation to Aruba,

406
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:39,216
so you went to
"Isle of Aroofa," tar beach.

407
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:41,394
PIus the guys
Iike to come up here

408
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:43,829
'cause this is where
the girls would come hang out.

409
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,930
I grew up in Queens.

410
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:50,999
AII I ever wanted
was the excitement
of the city.

411
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:53,836
Sounds Iike
all you ever wanted was quiet.
We should've traded places.

412
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:58,311
Large family in a
small apartment. I used to
come up here at night, too.

413
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:02,949
Used to Iook at the view
and the Iights
in the distance, think.

414
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:08,784
About the meaning of Iife?
That I had to get off
that rooftop.

415
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,758
Well, well, Leon, I guess
you wanted to get off
the rooftop, too.

416
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:15,989
Who you talking to?

417
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,622
Check this out.

418
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:20,499
It's Leon.

419
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:22,767
Took a taste and OD'd.

420
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:26,770
He could have been up here
since Iast night and nobody
would have seen him.

421
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:29,173
ME says he's been
down at Ieast 18 hours,

422
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:31,144
but he still could have
murdered Aisha Thompson.

423
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:34,306
Guy OD's two weeks
out of prison.
Talk about bad karma.

424
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:36,179
Well, maybe for Leon.

425
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:39,214
For his potential victims
it's all upside.

426
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:41,288
Yeah, thanks. Maybe not.

427
00:23:41,356 --> 00:23:42,550
FIN: What?

428
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:44,854
Another rooftop, another body.

429
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:49,695
Guy came up to feed
the pigeons, found her.

430
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:52,624
Anybody else up here
besides him and the victim?

431
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,292
Nobody.
Thanks.

432
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:56,365
How old is this one, Doc?

433
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:59,805
I'd say no more than 16.
Raped before she was killed.

434
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:01,865
Any ID?
Nothing on her.

435
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:06,170
Perp did a real number
on her face.

436
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:07,908
With what?
Brick.

437
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,808
Pieces of it
broke off in her skull.

438
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:14,688
This was on her
right index finger.
May help ID her.

439
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:17,321
Well, if it's Leon's work,
he's improvising.

440
00:24:17,392 --> 00:24:19,189
It couldn't
have been Leon Tate.

441
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:21,260
What are you talking about?

442
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,196
The victim's still in rigor.
Probably killed this morning.

443
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,459
Tate was dead by Iast night.

444
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:31,701
EIIiot...
I wanted it to be Leon.

445
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:34,105
Everything fit.
We wasted time.

446
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,779
Another girl's dead
because I went down
the wrong road.

447
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:44,715
You happy now?

448
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,344
Mrs. Tate,
I'm sorry about Leon.

449
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:48,855
Don't you dare
say you're sorry.

450
00:24:49,624 --> 00:24:51,023
You're glad he's dead.

451
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:54,220
He didn't kill those girls,
but you killed him anyway.

452
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,956
You murdered him.

453
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,124
Mrs. Tate, Detective Stabler
was doing his job.

454
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:01,497
My son was innocent.

455
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:04,671
Your son was gonna
kill somebody with his HIV.

456
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:06,229
We had to stop him.

457
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,905
We didn't put
the needle in his arm.
You didn't.

458
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:13,447
But you all stick together,
don't you?

459
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,853
Who's our victim?

460
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:27,622
Tiffany Purcell, 14.
Mother ID'ed her ring.

461
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:33,600
Fin, thanks for taking my back
with Mrs. Tate.

462
00:25:33,668 --> 00:25:34,794
Leon was scum.

463
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:37,531
He was gonna kill
some innocent girl
if you didn't stop him.

464
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,742
We're checking every parolee
in the Iast two years

465
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,142
who was ever collared
for anything violent
against women.

466
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,578
None of these m.o.'s
are the same.

467
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:48,309
STABLER: The pattern's
in the victimology.

468
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:52,843
AII the victims are black,
young, good students,
never been in trouble.

469
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:54,855
This is no wild-eyed psycho.

470
00:25:54,923 --> 00:25:57,551
Your perp is most Iikely
well-educated, attractive.

471
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,617
He seems trustworthy.
He has good social skills.

472
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:04,187
Every time he cons a girl
into submission, he's proving
how much smarter he is.

473
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:07,359
Okay, that could explain
why he changes Iocations
and m.o.'s.

474
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:08,902
That's part of his strategy.

475
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,201
He knew how much harder
it would be for you guys
to put his pattern together.

476
00:26:12,273 --> 00:26:15,606
He was right.
What about this victim
that he set on fire?

477
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:18,475
Something about her
sent him over the edge.

478
00:26:18,546 --> 00:26:20,878
Maybe she
physically injured him

479
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:23,713
or she said something
that would trigger
that Ievel of violence.

480
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:25,252
You mean Iike challenging
his manhood?

481
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,653
Any challenge
to his sense of control.
That's what this is all about.

482
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:32,090
These men often have wives
or steady girlfriends
who are submissive.

483
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,889
They seek
unconditional approval.

484
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:36,089
Well, my old man
never approved
of a single thing I ever did.

485
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:38,689
I don't go around raping
and killing young girls.

486
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:43,169
This perp was told that he
was no good enough times
to think that it was true.

487
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:49,643
AII any of these girls
has to say is "stop" and
that's Iikely to set him off.

488
00:26:50,812 --> 00:26:53,576
A rape and two murders
in one week tells me
we're on borrowed time

489
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:55,047
before he kills again.

490
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:58,313
Get all the
victims' descriptions
of the perp. Make a composite.

491
00:26:58,386 --> 00:27:00,047
We've got company.

492
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:02,353
I'II take him.

493
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:07,226
I thought you had him, man?
We were wrong.
We're gonna get him.

494
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:08,523
You aren't doing
a damn thing, are you?

495
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:10,496
What, 'cause it happened
north of 96th street?

496
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:13,659
You can save that
for somebody else, okay?
I know your family.

497
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:16,033
We're from the same place
and we're the same color.

498
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:21,732
Fin.
What happened?

499
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,276
Another girl.

500
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:29,345
BENSON: What do we got, Doc?

501
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:32,679
Cause of death
is Iigature strangulation.

502
00:27:32,754 --> 00:27:35,154
Some kind of thick shoelace,
maybe from a sneaker.

503
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:36,713
Dead about 12 hours.

504
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:37,883
Raped?

505
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,859
And she put up a fight,
tried to resist.

506
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:44,261
She's got finger-size bruises
on the inside of her thighs
where he pried her Iegs apart.

507
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:45,697
This wacko's out of control.

508
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:49,533
Well, I can't tell you
it's the same wacko
until I compare the DNA.

509
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:53,837
I've known her
since she was a baby.
It's horrible.

510
00:27:54,142 --> 00:27:58,238
Tina was a sweet girl.
I try to keep
the building safe.

511
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:00,547
What do you know
about Tina and her family?

512
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,276
Her parents are nice,
responsible people.

513
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,080
They're never Iate
with the rent, took care
of their apartment.

514
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:09,249
Do they know?
Her mother does.
She's downstairs.

515
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:13,319
Father sails on cargo ships.
They're trying
to reach him now.

516
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:16,591
Did you see Tina Iast night?
Sorry.

517
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:19,663
We're gonna need you
to take us down
to her apartment.

518
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:26,669
I sent Tina to the store
on the corner
for some milk and bread.

519
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:32,440
Do you remember what time?
Around 10:00 Iast night.

520
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,780
We walked out together.

521
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:40,843
I work graveyard
at the post office.

522
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,785
This is gonna kill her daddy.

523
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:50,727
Was she here
when you came home
this morning?

524
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,632
I did a couple of hours
overtime. I assumed
Tina went to school.

525
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,337
Does she ever have
any friends over
while you're at work?

526
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:02,433
No, only when I'm here.

527
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:07,907
How about boyfriends?
Tina is very shy around boys.

528
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:10,542
She said some kid at school
had a crush on her.

529
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:12,347
That's all I know about.

530
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:15,954
Who would do
something Iike this?

531
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:22,824
I'II be just a minute.

532
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:30,329
Piece of paper in her room
had some numbers on it.

533
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,235
I'II call them
and have someone
run them down.

534
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:33,364
Her mother give you anything?

535
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:36,376
Tina's Iast stop
was the corner store.

536
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:41,006
CLERK:
Yeah, she did come in here.
I was getting ready to close.

537
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:43,412
She come in with anybody?
No.

538
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:48,486
Some guy
did come in behind her.
They started talking.

539
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:49,818
This him?

540
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:53,455
This guy had a shaved head
and no beard.

541
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:56,925
You ever see him
in here before?
I just started
working here Iast week.

542
00:29:56,998 --> 00:29:58,090
What'd they talk about?

543
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,896
I didn't hear,
but they was talking
and Iaughing and stuff

544
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,233
Iike they knew each other.
They Ieft together, too.

545
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,336
FIN: Thanks, man.
AII right.

546
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:11,342
Shaved head? One of
my tenants just went for
the cue-ball Iook.

547
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:15,143
Which one?
Malik Harris. 3B.
Shaved his beard, too.

548
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:18,481
When?
Last few days.
Didn't even recognize him.

549
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,025
MUNCH: Malik Harris?

550
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:29,487
That's what it says on my
birth certificate, but I'm
known professionally as King.

551
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:32,727
We wanna talk to you, Malik.
You gonna invite us in?

552
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,290
Now is not a convenient time.

553
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:37,360
TANYA: Who's there, baby?
Nobody that concerns you.

554
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:39,132
I guess we're interrupting.

555
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:48,079
I told you I was busy.

556
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,378
Sweetie.

557
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,252
Baby, I was just wondering...

558
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:55,789
You see I'm speaking
to these officers?

559
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:01,855
What do you want?

560
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:03,897
Are you aware
of what's going on upstairs?

561
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:06,625
I haven't been out,
enlighten me.

562
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,566
A girl was murdered
on the rooftop.

563
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:11,264
Who?
Tina Dupree. You know her?

564
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,470
Yeah, I seen her around. Damn.

565
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:16,576
MUNCH: Somebody saw you
with her Iast night.

566
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:19,310
On the corner at the store.
I walked her home.

567
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,245
Little girl Iike that
shouldn't be out so Iate.

568
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:23,408
Can you tell us where you were
the rest of the night?

569
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,586
Baby, now you may dialogue.

570
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:31,418
We ain't Ieft the apartment.

571
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:34,188
We been busy.
You know what I am saying?

572
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,924
"Baby, now you may
dialogue"? PIease.

573
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,991
He was the Iast person
to see her.

574
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:44,162
Pretty big risk
if he's our serial killer,
striking where he Iives.

575
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,331
Unless Tina was a victim
of opportunity.

576
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:50,070
Harris goes to the store,
sees her, walks her home,

577
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:52,544
knows her mother
works at night,
father's out of town.

578
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:55,104
Yeah, police just putting on
a big show for us, that's all.

579
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:56,547
Just what we need.

580
00:31:56,617 --> 00:31:59,211
I got this. You got a problem?

581
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:02,051
Yeah, that you cops
don't give a rat's ass
what's going on up here.

582
00:32:02,123 --> 00:32:05,354
You don't think so?
Well, we're here.
You know who's not here?

583
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:07,189
The press, the TV news.

584
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,661
If you got any beef,
you got beef with them,
not us.

585
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,858
They can't make money off us.
They don't care. Word up.

586
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:15,664
Don't tell me. Tell them.
Why don't y'all give them
a call, all right?

587
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:19,934
Meanwhile, does anybody have
any information
that could help us?

588
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:26,946
Okay, people, please go back
to your business,
and Iet us do our job.

589
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,243
Not you.

590
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:32,818
Why do you wanna make this
harder on yourself
than it already is?

591
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:37,423
Aisha was all I had Ieft,
all right? Now some scum
took her away,

592
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:39,823
and I'm supposed to stand here
and watch you not catch him?

593
00:32:41,062 --> 00:32:42,654
What's harder than that, man?

594
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:50,936
Checked the phone numbers
we found
in Tina Dupree's room.

595
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:53,974
One belongs to a girlfriend.
The other, Malik Harris.

596
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,133
Harris have a rap sheet?

597
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:58,406
Never arrested, but came up
on the computer as a victim
of vehicular assault.

598
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:01,243
Hit by a car in '94.
Right after the third murder.

599
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,146
His Iegs were shattered,
almost Iost them.

600
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:04,878
Hospitalized in rehab
for nearly a year,

601
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:06,715
spent the next two Iearning
how to walk again.

602
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:09,278
So Harris
was only out of action
for three years.

603
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:10,449
Our perp waited seven.

604
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:14,187
He gets
social security disability.
From '97 to Iast year,

605
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:16,491
his checks were sent
to an address in Detroit.

606
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:17,826
Harris has a sister
who Iives there.

607
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:21,163
Get Detroit Homicide
on the phone, see if they
have any unsolved killings

608
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:25,103
matching our victim profiles.
Fin, my office, now.

609
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,302
I just got off the phone

610
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:32,744
with the Deputy Commissioner
for public information.

611
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:33,905
Now, he wants to know

612
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:36,643
why one of my detectives
is bad-mouthing the media
up in Harlem.

613
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:37,877
I was just telling them
the truth.

614
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:40,614
What the hell
were you thinking?
That those people were right.

615
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:42,383
That's not your
judgment to make.

616
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:44,924
If these girls were
murdered in the Village
or the Upper West Side,

617
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:46,425
the media would be
all over it.

618
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:48,724
1PP would issue a task force.

619
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,690
Five black girls
aren't even on their radar.

620
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:54,427
Are you finished?
No, I'm just getting started.

621
00:33:54,502 --> 00:33:56,732
This is no different
than any other investigation.

622
00:33:56,804 --> 00:34:00,900
No? An East
Side socialite disappears,
we got 50 cops on it.

623
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:04,311
BIack girls
start getting executed,
we got four cops.

624
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,175
That sounds equal to you?

625
00:34:06,614 --> 00:34:10,050
Look, I know
where you're coming from.
No, you don't know
where I'm coming from.

626
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:11,982
There's no way you can know
where I'm coming from.

627
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:13,918
Don't you dare presume to know
what's in my head.

628
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:15,285
No matter what you say,
Captain,

629
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:18,086
you're not black
and you're not from the hood.

630
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:32,063
SIow down.

631
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,300
That crowd
could have turned ugly.
I diffused it.

632
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,570
Cragen didn't know that.
Who you defending? Him or me?

633
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:39,340
Both of you.
Just take a deep breath.
No time for that.

634
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,710
Where are we going?

635
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,117
I'm going to meet
an informant. AIone.

636
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:48,321
FIN: I'm busy.
This better be good.

637
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,117
BENNY:
How about a Iittle respect.

638
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:53,158
Time is money,
and I'm Iosing it
talking to you.

639
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:55,787
What the hell are you doing
back there? Sit up Iike a man.

640
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:56,955
Yeah, I get seen with you,

641
00:34:57,031 --> 00:34:59,932
my customers go elsewhere
for their merchandise.

642
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,160
You got something
for me, Benny,

643
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,998
or did you just come here
to run your mouth?

644
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,039
Word's out you're Iooking
to jam up King.
Where you hear that?

645
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:08,132
I got sources just Iike you.

646
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:12,009
What do your sources
know about him?
That King's a
rap promoter wannabe.

647
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,571
Manages a few unknowns,
but doesn't have
the goods to make it big.

648
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:18,482
He uses the rap Iine
mostly to pick up women.

649
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:20,520
So far you're boring me.

650
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:24,884
How about he buys his coke
and dope from one of
my corner boys?

651
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:28,957
Now you're talking.
Where's he get his cash?

652
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:30,690
King's a kept man.

653
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:34,129
Smooth-talks one of his Iadies
into paying for his Iifestyle,

654
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:36,635
till they wise up, dump him.

655
00:35:38,072 --> 00:35:41,269
What's in this for you,
Benny?
I don't Iike him.

656
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:44,441
Consider it a freebie.

657
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:49,580
Harris admits to walking
Tina Dupree home,

658
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,550
and we got witnesses
that saw them together.

659
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:52,916
That doesn't mean
he killed her.

660
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,545
We took the composites
from all the rapes

661
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:57,216
and had the artist
remove the hair.
That's Malik Harris dead-on.

662
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:59,657
A judge isn't going to give us
a search warrant
based on that.

663
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:02,696
What about a Iineup?
We risk tipping our hand.

664
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:05,391
I got an informant,
a drug dealer I busted
a few years ago.

665
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:09,300
He says his boys sell
Malik Harris dope and coke
on a regular basis.

666
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,928
Well, write the warrant
for the drugs only.

667
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:12,495
That'II allow you to search
almost everywhere.

668
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,564
Anything you find
on top of that is gravy.

(SINGING RAP SONG)

670
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:32,558
I can't talk to you right now.
I'm cutting a track here.

671
00:36:32,626 --> 00:36:34,924
Yeah, maybe you should be
recording jailhouse rock.

672
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:36,895
Man, what are you
talking about?
You're under arrest.

673
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:39,296
For what?
Possession of narcotics
in the third degree.

674
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,459
What?
We tossed your crib.

675
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:44,167
What you gonna do?
Make her a star
and then kill her, too?

676
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,763
What is up with that?

677
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:51,370
You're putting me through
all of this for some
recreational pharmaceuticals?

678
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:55,677
You Iike big words, King?
How about execution
or Iethal injection?

679
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:57,273
What, you gonna give me
the death penalty

for a Iittle cocaine
and heroin?

00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:06,223
Poor girls.

683
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,521
And you think that I
have something to do
with killing them?

684
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:11,622
You were the Iast one
with Tina before she was
found dead.

685

Feel free to dialogue.

686
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:18,628
I told you I walked her home.
Anything after that
I'm not accountable for.

you've met my Iovely alibi.

Who'II say anything
once you doped her up.

689
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:24,567
I am innocent.

690

to prove your innocence.

I can't allow that.
You got something to hide?

He says it,
I can't take the sample.

properly introduced.

sometime under circumstances
more conducive.

Don't you ever want to...
Your thoughts
aren't very religious.

right onto the Ienses.

The cells I found
that were usable
were on the nose pieces.

714
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,404
So what's the verdict?

715
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:34,436
His Majesty's DNA is a match
on all six murders
and eight rapes.

CABOT: This motion to suppress
is totally without merit.

718
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:45,756
Malik Harris's right
to genetic privacy
was violated.

719
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,125
The police have gotten DNA
off of coffee cups,
Iipstick, telephones,

720
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:53,826
even a suspect's spit
on the street.
AII of it upheld in court.

721
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:56,893
People discard coffee cups
and spit voluntarily.

722

Detective Tutuola
assaulted my client
and stole his glasses.

723
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:04,042
When Mr. Harris's sunglasses
fell, he demanded
the detectives replace them.

724
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:06,011
He discarded them,
which makes them fair game.

725
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,844
So what we're saying here
is that the police,
at any time,

726
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,077
can obtain a person's
genetic code?

727
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:13,676
The DNA obtained by the police
conclusively Iinks
the defendant

00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,654
to the murders
of a half a dozen
teenage girls.

What about their rights?

Mr. Harris's guilt
or innocence
isn't the issue here.

00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:22,552
How the police gathered
the evidence is.

732
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:24,824
Your Honor,
reasonable deception
on the part of the police

733
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:26,388
has been upheld
by the Supreme Court.

734
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:30,801
Yes, and if the police
had tricked Mr. Harris
into giving up his sunglasses,

735
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,338
we'd be out of here.

00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:37,105
They forced him,
that's coercion,
the DNA is out.

737
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:41,773
The DNA is all the police have
tying my client
to these murders.

738
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:47,985
Then I have no other choice
but to drop the charges
against Mr. Harris.

739
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:51,855
And when your detectives blame
the judge, tell them that
they're the ones that blew it.

740
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,226
No, no, no.
We didn't screw up.
We got Harris off the street.

741
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:58,821
Your judge Iet him go.

742
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,163
What did you expect?
A Iittle justice.

743
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,634
Then maybe you
should have done better.

744
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:04,102
We got you all the evidence
you needed.

745
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:06,162
If you'd done it Iegally,
this wouldn't have happened.

746
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,606
AII right, come on. This isn't
getting us anywhere.

747
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:09,835
What do we have Ieft?

748
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,606
Possession three
on the drugs that we found
in his apartment.

749
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,977
Is there anything
we can do with that
to keep him off the street?

750
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:17,881
First offense,
Harris'II make bail.
Just gonna give up?

751
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:20,579
I will ask for remand,
but the judge
will never go for it.

752
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,019
And I can't
mention the murders.

753
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,579
Harris gets out,
we stick with him.

754
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:26,285
I want all four of you
in the courtroom
for the arraignment.

755
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,520
Don't Iet him
out of your sight.

756
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:30,188
If he so much as sneezes,
I want the KIeenex.

757
00:40:31,398 --> 00:40:34,629
JUDGE: Remand, Ms. Cabot?
On a third degree
possession charge?

758
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:36,999
CABOT:
Mr. Harris provided the drugs
to young women.

759
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,868
The People believe
he is a danger
to the community.

760
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,767
Counsel approach.

761
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,614
Ms. Cabot,
I have 40 more cases
on the docket

762
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,741
and you're wasting my time
on this frivolous garbage?

763
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:52,809
Your Honor,
it is the People's position
that we...

764
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:54,945
You screwed up
your murder case

765
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:57,616
and now you want me
to do your dirty work for you.

766
00:40:57,691 --> 00:40:59,852
Not gonna happen. Step back.

767
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:05,865
Bail is set at $2,000,
cash only.

768
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,965
Next case.

769
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,693
Let's go.

770
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,362
Son of a bitch!

771
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,036
You killed my sister, man!
JUDGE: Order. Officer.

772
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:19,078
He's a cold-blooded murderer.
Officer. Officer,
clear the court!

773
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:21,075
Bastard bit me!
Bastard bit me!

774
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:23,309
Bring it. Come on, bring it.
Remove that man!

775
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:25,749
Officer, order.
AII right, we'II take him.
We'II take him.

776
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:26,911
Order!
THOMPSON: You'II take me?

777
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,182
Yeah, you're under arrest
for assault.
Whoa. Hold it.

778
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,690
He gets away
with murdering my sister,
and you taking me?

779
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,424
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

780
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:39,855
Harris,
Iet's see your hands, now.
You're under arrest.

781
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:45,493
It's over, Your Highness.
You ain't got nothing on me.

782
00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:47,199
Just taking
a bite out of crime.

783
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:49,834
Just Iike you took a bite
out of Rodney Thompson's arm.

784
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,879
And Ieft your DNA.
Thought you were
smarter than that.

785
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:01,045
Fin?
Counselor?

786
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:03,088
You and Rodney Thompson
put on quite a performance

787
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:04,384
when you Ied him out of court.

788
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,517
What are you talking about?
Setting Harris up

789
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:09,061
by telling Thompson
the only way we were
going to get Harris's DNA

790
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:10,892
is if he attacked him.
Thompson's not a perp.

791
00:42:10,964 --> 00:42:12,625
I can't force him
to do anything.

792
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,792
No, but you could have
given him the idea.

793
00:42:15,135 --> 00:42:16,363
Did you?

794
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,697
You really want to know?

795
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:21,732
No.

796
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,742
It was a setup.

797
00:42:25,812 --> 00:42:27,905
We arranged
for your client
to bite Rodney Thompson?

798
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:29,073
I don't think so.

799
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:32,482
Bit yourself in the ass
with your big mouth
this time, King.

800
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,181
This is entrapment.
CABOT: Ask your attorney.
She'II tell you it's not.

801
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:40,560
I just heard from Detroit.
Malik's DNA.

802
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:43,386
Matches four homicides,
five rapes,

803
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:45,727
all during the time
he was Iiving with his sister.

804
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:55,400
I want a deal.
FIN: You want a deal?

805
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:59,979
How about right before
we execute you
for killing those girls,

806
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:03,172
I bring you your Iast meal?
How's that?
