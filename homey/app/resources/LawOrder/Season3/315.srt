00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:00,131
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,203 --> 00:00:03,866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,100
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:08,109
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:11,669
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,443
These are their stories,

7
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:16,951
BRODUS: What time is it?

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,715
HUANG: You have
two hours Ieft.

9
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:20,653
BRODUS: You're boring me.

10
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:21,985
HUANG: Why?

11
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:24,458
'Cause your theories
are flawed.

12
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:26,226
Which ones?

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,691
AImost all of them.

14
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:33,497
And for the record,
I never degraded anybody.

15
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:34,627
What do you care
what I think?

16
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:38,734
Because according
to your theories,
I don't care about anything.

17
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:41,907
It's not the Iast time,
and certainly not the first.

18
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:44,071
Well, then, set me straight.

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,072
Tell me about
your first time.

20
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,208
I'm asking the questions now.

21
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:51,720
You tell me
about your first time.
How do you remember it?

22
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:54,382
Fondly.
I'm not asking you.

23
00:00:58,294 --> 00:00:59,488
Fondly.

24
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:02,523
I don't have time for games.

25
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:08,163
It was painful.

26
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:09,226
BRODUS: For who?

27
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:12,103
For her. I thought
I'd done something wrong.

28
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:14,643
You did. You knocked her up.

29
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,010
For all your sweaty fumbling,
you earned a Iifetime
of responsibility.

30
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:22,179
You Iook the type to have
a Iot of Iittle bastards
running around.

31
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:23,809
How many are there?

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,580
A few.

33
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:31,315
You're just a rutting dog
in the streets,
a slave to your impulses.

34
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:32,691
Your point being,
you're just Iike me?

35
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:34,923
You're exactly Iike me.

36
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:37,628
My first time
was painful, too.

37
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:42,669
But it was perfect.
The thing was exquisite.

38
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:44,399
What was her name?

39
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:47,204
Nice try.

40
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,304
Well, now Iook
who's playing games.

41
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,609
It's my party, gentlemen.
You can Ieave anytime.

42
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:56,743
HUANG: But then you wouldn't
have any control,
and where's the fun in that?

43
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:59,048
I hate psychiatrists.
Don't you?

44
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:00,282
Absolutely.

45
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:03,348
You're not Iiked.
How does that make you feel?

46
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:05,151
Insightful.

47
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:06,525
Really?

48
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:11,199
You're a Iiar, Matt.
Your first time
wasn't perfect.

49
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:14,327
In fact, it was
so disappointing,
you try not to remember it.

50
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:18,339
You were so inept,
so inexperienced, that you
didn't even achieve a climax.

51
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:21,342
Not even when
you were by yourself,
reliving the moment.

52
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,211
One thing was young,
ripe, begging for it.

53
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,609
But I took my time with it.

54
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:33,644
It had the most beautiful
brown eyes, almost sleepy.

55
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:38,186
Till I went to work.
Then they went big and round.

56
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:41,759
First it pleaded,
then it bargained.

57
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,162
This interview's over.

58
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:46,827
The thing screamed in pain,
yelled in fear.

59
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:50,071
It was alive
through every moment of it,

60
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,906
even when I gutted it
and the blood sprayed
over me Iike a warm shower.

61
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:56,739
(SLURPING)

62
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:59,007
I can almost taste it.

63
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:02,781
Relax, Chief. The guards
are changing shift.

64
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,218
EIIiot, get up
from the table!

65
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:12,543
Detective Stabler. It's been
a while, so I don't expect
you'd remember.

66
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:15,022
I'm AIIen Cooper,
my wife Hannah.

67
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:16,982
Our daughter Debbie
was murdered...

68
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,959
Debbie, of course.

69
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:22,589
It'II be 1 1 years next month.
Her killer was never caught.

70
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,355
She was on her way home
from school...

71
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:28,631
When she was abducted. I
remember. My partner, Dave
Rosetti, was the Iead on it.

72
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:31,366
Yeah. We heard he died.
We're real sorry.

73
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,934
That's why we're coming
to you now. We know
who killed our Iittle girl.

74
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,411
Who?

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,141
Matthew Brodus.

76
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:43,509
When it first happened,
we couldn't
get past the grief.

77
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:45,816
Stuck in our heads,
in the pain.

78
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:48,721
Losing Debbie
almost tore us apart.

79
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,158
Grief therapy,
victims' groups.

80
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:56,528
We finally got to a place
where we thought we could
deal with not knowing.

81
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,124
At Ieast until
Matthew Brodus's
press conference.

82
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:02,102
Well, what did he say
to make you believe
he killed your daughter?

83
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:05,470
He wants to sell tickets
to his execution,

84
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,772
claiming he's raising money
for his daughter's education.

85
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:11,574
Well, he doesn't
have any children
that we're aware of.

86
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:13,308
I still don't see
the connection, though.

87
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:17,614
The school Brodus mentioned
was Our Lady of Light,
in Lower Manhattan.

88
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,150
Debbie's old school.

89
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:25,360
If Brodus is
Debbie Cooper's killer,

90
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,362
why didn't the computer
match the signature?

91
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,421
The murder happened pre-VICAP.

92
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:31,898
A Iot of open homicides
that still aren't
in the system.

93
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,458
New Jersey is not gonna Iet us
near this hump anyway,

94
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:37,267
and even if they did,
Brodus could
still refuse to talk.

95
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,739
No. Not this guy.

96
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:40,435
What makes you so sure?

97
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:43,945
Because serial killers
typically kill their victims
immediately

98
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:46,106
and then they take their time
with the bodies.

99
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:48,377
Brodus is different.
He kept his victims alive.

100
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:51,614
He wanted them
to watch him work.
He needs an audience.

101
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:55,088
Well, the ME's report stated
that Debbie Cooper
did suffer before she died.

102
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,523
She was hogtied
with plumber's tape
and tortured.

103
00:05:57,593 --> 00:05:59,493
And Brodus worked
as a plumber's apprentice.

104
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:02,224
He abducted his victims,
he murdered them
at a remote site

105
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:03,697
and then he dumped
their bodies.

106
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,825
This homicide matches
the Jersey victims.

107
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:08,529
Except for
the pierced corneas,
committed premortem.

108
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:10,572
Why blind this victim
and not the others?

109
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,665
It's strictly symbolic,
since he wasn't going
to Iet her survive.

110
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:15,210
She knew him.

111
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:18,205
That's what Dave Rosetti
always thought when
we canvassed everybody.

112
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,805
We could just never
make the damn connection.

113
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,214
And what makes you think
you can now?

114
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:25,776
Just get this guy
in front of me.
That's all I'II need.

115
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:29,347
He dies in Iess than 72 hours.
That might not be an option.

116
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:32,883
Brodus is a
multi-victim signature killer.
That's very rare.

117
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:36,454
And it's even more rare
to find somebody
who's done it more than once.

118
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:38,193
Maybe I could get
a field interview.

119
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,098
Can the Feds
force Jersey to cooperate?

120
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,731
No, but a request from
the brass might grease
the wheel. I'II Iet you know.

121
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:48,871
EIIiot. Look, I...

122
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,144
I know you want to help
the Coopers.

123
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:53,841
That's not what this is about
and you know it.

124
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,248
Dave Rosetti put a slug
through his jaw over this.

125
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,717
You've got three days
to play it out.

126
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,224
Have Munch run
the Cooper evidence box
over to the Iab.

127
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:06,125
Maybe 10 years Iater
we can find some DNA.

128
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,127
Beware the cop bearing gifts.

129
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:16,365
Forget it. I've got three
separate yet simultaneous
trials to prep for.

130
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,670
Hey, we're in a time crunch.
The perp dies
day after tomorrow.

131
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:20,902
Are you trying to clear him?

132
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:21,965
Not our jurisdiction.

133
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:25,070
We just need some evidence
to tie him to our homicide.

134
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:27,547
If he dies
before we can prove it,
the case remains open.

135
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:28,947
What have I got to work with?

136
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:33,216
Well, we got some
plumber's tape, various fibers
and two different blood types.

137
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,347
Well, Iet me see
what I can do.

138
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:35,515
You the man.

139
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:40,326
(BELL RINGING)

140
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:42,193
REICHART: Come on.
Don't be Iate.

141
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:45,359
I didn't know Debbie Cooper.
She was before my time.

142
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,994
What happened
to your predecessor,
Mr. Jamison?

143
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,038
Died of a heart attack
in the mid '90s.

144
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:52,505
I'm not really sure
how I can help you,
after all this time.

145
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,136
Well, my notes state
Debbie Cooper was very
close to a few teachers.

146
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:59,670
Vivian Parish,
Michael McKeeney
and Andrea Mason.

147
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:01,010
Are they still employed here?

148
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,778
I never met Vivian Parish.

149
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:06,379
Michael Ieft teaching in '98.
I have no idea where he is.

150
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:09,754
And Andrea Mason
teaches Government,
but she's out sick.

151
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:11,122
We'II need her home number.

152
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:12,751
It's in the office.

153
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:15,126
Were there
any construction jobs
during that time?

154
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:19,896
The rectory was converted
in the '60s. Gym, pool, track
were all added in the '70s.

155
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,937
That's about it.

156
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,562
Any plumbing problems?

157
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,834
We had an old boiler system
that had to be replaced.

158
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:28,775
Work was done by
a place in Brooklyn.
I'II get you the name.

159
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:30,243
Thanks.

160
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:33,577
I had three men
working that job.
Two of them are still here.

161
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,082
And do you use subcontractors?

162
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,880
Well, sure,
if the job's too big.
But this one wasn't.

163
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,853
How many employees
did you have then?

164
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,549
Fifteen, twenty.

165
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:44,422
The apprentices
work part-time.
They come and go.

166
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:48,327
Did you have
a Linwood Bradley,
Matthew Braeden

167
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:49,887
or Lonnie Matthews
on the payroll?

168
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:51,728
Hey, what's this all about?

169
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,328
That serial killer,
Matthew Linwood Brodus.
Those are his aliases.

170
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:59,632
Do you guys really think
if I had that crazy
working for me,

171
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,142
I wouldn't have
gone to the police?

172
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:05,840
Here, Iook for yourselves.
That bastard
never worked here.

173
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,942
Pretty defensive for a guy
with a clear conscience.

174
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,544
Maybe he didn't want
to be Iinked with Brodus,
but I'II check him out.

175
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,179
Still no answer
at Andrea Mason's.

176
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:17,248
When's the Iast time
you took a sick day
when you were actually sick?

177
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,157
Good point. Stabler.

178
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,091
Yeah. No problem.
I'II be there.

179
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:27,158
AII right. Huang wants me
to meet him down at the FBI
field office for Iunch.

180
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,430
Maybe he's got some good news.

181
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:31,337
Good news from the Feds?
More Iike, "Bend over,
we're taking over your case."

182
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,567
John, times have changed.

183
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,233
They're not the Iying bastards
they used to be.

184
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:37,478
HUANG: There's no time
for a sit-down Iunch.

185
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:39,343
We're doing indirect
personality assessments

186
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:40,939
with Brodus'
ex-cellmates today.

187
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,040
How many are there?

188
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:43,209
Thanks. Two.

189
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:45,845
Robert Rule's doing Iife
for rape and manslaughter.

190
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:48,754
Leroy Russell's on death row.
Converted to Islam inside.

191
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:52,021
Since then he's been
a model prisoner,
refuses to talk to us.

192
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:53,584
What are these IPAs
supposed to give us?

193
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:56,392
Background, Iikes, dislikes,
any way to relate to Brodus,

194
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,626
because he's not just
gonna confess to you.

195
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,464
I know how to
interrogate a prisoner.

196
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:03,528
I know you do, but I doubt
you've encountered this Ievel
of depravity before.

197
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:05,233
I've dealt with
serial killers before...

198
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:06,797
Who hunted for
short periods of time.

199
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,002
They're more psychologically
inclined to confess.

200
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,909
Brodus hunted for years
without detection.

201
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,541
He's Iike Dahmer
and Lucas and Bundy.

202
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:17,245
Sometimes it takes years
for killers Iike that
to relax their guard.

203
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,482
Look, they all want to talk.
Even Bundy cooperated
in the end.

204
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:23,047
Yeah. When you get closer
to the kill date
they become more pliable,

205
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,993
but you gotta remember
this is a game. Brodus
is holding all the cards.

206
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:36,401
You know,
I'm missing Wheel of Fortune
for this Iittle talk.

207
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:38,104
What's in it for you?

208
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:41,267
You want Brodus?
I want time shaved.

209
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,768
Sorry. There's no deal
to be had.

210
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:46,576
I'm serving a Iife sentence.

211
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,810
You're a career criminal,
Rule.

212
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:51,648
A Iife sentence
doesn't mean Iife,
death doesn't mean death,

213
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,655
25 years,
it's 1 2 and a half-to-15.

214
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:56,486
That burns you, huh?

215
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:00,726
Look, I ain't going nowhere.

216
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,991
Check with the warden.
I'm in for the Iong haul.

217
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:07,001
Then you should be glad,
getting a good mark
on your prison record.

218
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,596
Hey, I can't do something
for nothing. How would
that Iook on my block?

219
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:11,901
I gotta Iive here.

220
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:14,204
Deal depends on what you know
and then we'II talk terms.

221
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:16,403
No. I think we're done here.

222
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:18,446
We haven't even started.

223
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:21,547
Either you
answer the questions
or you don't, Mr. Rule.

224
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:23,414
The FBI doesn't deal.

225
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:29,481
What the hell
was that all about?

226
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:30,923
Procedure.

227
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,228
I suggest you get familiar
with it before we do
any more interviews.

228
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:36,491
We make deals all the time.
You should've heard Rule out.

229
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,192
He doesn't know anything
except for background.

230
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,962
We'd just be wasting our time
with anything else.

231
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,026
Yeah, how do you know that
if you don't talk
to the scrote?

232
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:44,299
Because Brodus would
never have told him
anything substantive.

233
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:45,840
He would've considered
Rule beneath him.

234
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,307
You know that for a fact, huh?

235
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,241
I've been doing this
for a Iong time.
So have I.

236
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:52,439
You don't get up
from the table until
you've seen everyone's hand.

237
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:58,819
The FBI is running
these interviews and I'm
not offering any deals.

238
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:01,651
I hope that's clear.

239
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:09,896
Jersey won't play ball.
Okay. What can we do?

240
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:12,490
File an official request,
Iet it go through channels.

241
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:15,036
By the time we get
that answer, Brodus
will be dead and buried.

242
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:17,265
We can't tell another state
how to run its business.

243
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,274
New Jersey already has
an inferiority complex
when it comes to New York.

244
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:23,277
They're digging
in their heels on principle.

245
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:27,139
AIex, how many phone calls
from victims have you gotten

246
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:30,185
asking why you Iost a case
and what you're gonna
do about it?

247
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:31,719
I've had my share.

248
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:35,052
And how many times
do you actually get
a second chance?

249
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,194
What would you Iike me to do?

250
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:41,559
File a temporary stay.

251
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,461
No. I am not
comfortable with that.

252
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:45,056
I'm not Iooking
to commute the guy's sentence.

253
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,999
I just want a Iittle more time
for myself.

254
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:50,869
Do you have
any direct evidence
Iinking Brodus to the victim?

255
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,429
Not yet.

256
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:53,839
Then find me some.

257
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,400
In the meantime,
I'm gonna head to New Jersey

258
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:59,276
and ask an old friend
for a really big favor.

259
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:07,813
As good as it is to see you,
AIex, the answer's still no.

260
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,380
It's just an interview.

261
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,289
You've granted them to other
Iaw enforcement agencies.

262
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,384
Why not to mine?

263
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:16,090
Well, the other cops talked
to Brodus while he still
had appeals on the table,

264
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,963
and we're on the home stretch
now, I can't afford to have
anything go wrong.

265
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:22,401
We're not trying
to sabotage your execution.
We just want some answers.

266
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:24,600
Well, if he's your guy,

267
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,903
whoever the victim is
will have justice
the day after tomorrow.

268
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,441
I cannot believe you're gonna
make me do this the hard way.

269
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:35,381
What'd you expect,
ancient history to get you
an invite to the table?

270
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:39,413
You know, I came here
as one professional
to another.

271
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:41,513
I don't need to revel
in the past.

272
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:45,485
You're good, AIex,
not spectacular.

273
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:49,153
This is
a political powder keg,
so we can't accommodate you.

274
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:51,631
What's the matter, AIan,
is this a re-election year?

275
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,294
New Yorkers can't seek relief
because they don't vote here?

276
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:56,798
You've grown a pair
since the Iast time I saw you.

277
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:59,932
Yeah. Well, you've Iost yours,
because victims' rights
used to be a priority.

278
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:01,168
What if he confesses?

279
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:02,437
Is that such a bad thing?

280
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:05,207
What is to stop him
from confessing to murders
in other states

281
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,477
and whipping Iaw enforcement
into a jurisdictional frenzy?

282
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,745
What then?
Then you deal with it.

283
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:13,014
If he murdered other victims
and he takes it to his grave,

284
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:14,817
you become the facilitator.

285
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,986
Brodus will do anything,
say anything to stay
his execution.

286
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,188
Henry Lee Lucas did it.
Bundy did it.

287
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:23,322
It's their nature
to exploit our weaknesses.

288
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:26,526
I'm sorry, AIex,
no one gets access. Period.

289
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:34,039
Unfortunately there wasn't
enough blood to get DNA.

290
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:36,373
What're you talking about?
The victim's shirt
was soaked in it.

291
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:38,208
Well, the blood
was mostly hers,
not the killer's.

292
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,443
EIeven years ago,
the Iab used 90%
of the sample for typing.

293
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:43,545
Give us some good news.
Come on.

294
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:46,779
Well, the fibers
are consistent
with uniform cloth.

295
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:49,983
It was cross-matched to a
company that dyes material
for heavy crawl suits,

296
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:51,650
pest control, construction.

297
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,160
PIumbers' uniforms.

298
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:54,695
AIso, the tape
that bound your victim

299
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,731
matches the bin number
of the New Jersey bodies.

300
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:57,856
There's our connection.

301
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,298
Yeah, it's still
too circumstantial

302
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:01,029
to force New Jersey's back
against the wall.

303
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,230
I could compare
their fibers to ours.

304
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:04,829
You think
we'd have any trouble
getting it from them?

305
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:06,431
Not without a fight. No.

306
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,936
You find anything to Iink
the plumbing company
to Brodus?

307
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:10,808
No quarterlies were paid for
under any of his aliases.

308
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,313
Under the table.
So I checked with the owner.

309
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:16,442
Moderate business,
pays his taxes,
guy even does jury duty.

310
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:18,577
I didn't know that
Iaw-abiding citizens existed.

311
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:19,678
You recanvassed
the Cooper neighborhood?

312
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,382
Yeah, and you owe me
a new pair of shoes.

313
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,447
No, but after 10 years,
people move,
they don't remember.

314
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,787
How about that teacher?
Andrea Mason?

315
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,884
Yeah. Did you find her?

316
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:27,223
The interview is scheduled
for tomorrow morning.

317
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:29,730
I got you covered, EIIiot.
If there was anything solid,
I'd Iet you know.

318
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:31,129
I'm running
out of time here, John.

319
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,657
You're running out of options.
The Coopers
are running out of time.

320
00:15:36,138 --> 00:15:39,369
I need you to make a deal
with an inmate who shared
a cell with Brodus.

321
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,068
What's he in for?

322
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:44,205
Two counts rape,
one count manslaughter.
No.

323
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,147
Look, I've hit a wall
and he may have
some information

324
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:50,343
that'II help us with Brodus.

325
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:52,415
He's not talking
without some kind
of incentive.

326
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:54,352
Where's Huang on this?

327
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:55,753
He wants to follow procedure.

328
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:56,950
So do I.

329
00:15:57,025 --> 00:16:00,722
And while we play
by some arbitrary rules,
the Coopers just have to wait?

330
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:04,823
EIIiot, why are you
pushing so hard?

331
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:10,001
You know, I studied
the crime scene photos,
I read the files.

332
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:13,935
Brodus mutilated 12 women,
premortem.

333
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,442
It's pretty horrific stuff.

334
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,776
Now try to imagine
the strength, the will it took
to keep those women alive

335
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,839
and feed off their terror.

336
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:26,286
I'm gonna need as much
ammunition as possible,
if I'm gonna trip this guy up.

337
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:29,449
And you think this prisoner
will give you some Ieverage?

338
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:32,721
Well, I ain't gonna know
unless I can talk to him.

339
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:38,021
As soon as I corroborate your
information, we ship you off
to Danbury Federal Prison.

340
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:41,834
That's fair.
I raped that girl.

341
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:45,264
I know I belong in prison,
but not here.

342
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,900
What can you tell me
about Matthew Brodus?

343
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:50,877
I got a Iittle girl.
She's five.

344
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:52,675
Her name's Marlene.

345
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:57,014
Man, you bulls
sure know how to check up.

346
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:01,982
My ex won't Iet me
talk to her.
She's all I got.

347
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:07,457
It's hard to do time unless
you got something good
to hold on to.

348
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,359
She sends me drawings

349
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:18,270
and I got a photo
of her third birthday,
blowing out the candles.

350
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,831
Where are we going with this?

351
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,000
Will you call her for me?

352
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:26,971
No.

353
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:31,080
Look, you ask my ex,
how's my baby growing?

354
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:34,122
What's her favorite color?
How's she doing in school?

355
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:36,214
PIease, that's all I want.

356
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:38,354
No.
PIease.

357
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:43,029
I ain't got
nothing to say, man.

358
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:48,801
AII I want is to find out
about my Iittle girl.

359
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:53,041
If you had a kid,
you'd understand.

360
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:01,343
I make that call,
we talk about Brodus?

361
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,808
For as Iong as you want.

362
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,348
What's the number?

363
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:11,654
(DIALING)

364
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:16,887
(PHONE RINGING)

365
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:22,693
WOMAN: Hello?
Hello. This is
Detective EIIiot Stabler.

366
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,602
I'm calling
on behalf of Robert Rule...

367
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:26,368
I miss you so much!

368
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:28,373
(DIAL TONE SOUNDING)

369
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,646
She hung up.

370
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:35,780
Satisfied?

371
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:37,808
Yeah, right.

372
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,850
Thanks for trying.

373
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:49,524
If you have any questions
about the assignment,
just see me after class.

374
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,463
Thank you, Miss Mason.

375
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:57,232
Andrea Mason?
Detective John Munch.
We spoke on the phone.

376
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:59,631
Right. Debbie Cooper,
10 years Iater.

377
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,141
Yeah, how well
did you know her?

378
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:03,234
Well, History
wasn't her best subject.

379
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:06,610
She did a Iot of extra credit
to pull her grade up.

380
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:07,670
That's it?

381
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,979
Look, I'm sorry.
It was a Iong time ago.

382
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,281
I think it's great
you're still trying
to solve her murder,

383
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:13,946
but even when it was fresh

384
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,855
she was just one
of many students
who pass through that door.

385
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,187
She didn't really
stand out, huh?

386
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,694
No. Debbie was awkward,
a Iate bloomer.

387
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:24,721
Besides Vivian Parish and
a few friends, no one really
took an interest in her.

388
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,596
Do you know
where I can find
Vivian Parish?

389
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,398
Last I heard,
she moved to New Mexico.

390
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:30,832
Thanks.

391
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,769
Let me guess.
Rule gave you nothing.

392
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:40,943
Just what he'd culled
from newspapers and the TV.

393
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:45,018
One day you're going
to actually realize
that I know what I'm doing.

394
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,348
I had to give it a shot.

395
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,551
Apology accepted.

396
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:52,917
Let's move on.

397
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,157
So where do we go from here?

398
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,933
Brodus' other cellmate.

399
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:03,596
We figure out a way to get
Leroy Russell to sit down
with us. He's still refusing.

400
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:05,663
Says it's not on his path
to AIIah.

401
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,868
We're Iooking for
Detective Stabler.
His captain said he'd be here.

402
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:12,038
Detectives Yorkin
and Janowicz,
Brooklyn SVU.

403
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:15,848
Did you allow an inmate
named Robert Rule
to use your cell phone?

404
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:16,975
What's going on?

405
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:20,852
A call was placed to
a rape victim. She phoned
our precinct in hysterics.

406
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:25,222
We dumped her phones
and got the cell number
for a Manhattan SVU detective.

407
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,193
Care to tell us
what the hell you were doing?

408
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:35,866
The victim's name
is EIizabeth Shachtman.

409
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:38,838
She was 16
when Rule brutally raped her.
I read the file.

410
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:42,138
A Iittle Iate for that.
What the hell
were you thinking?

411
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,576
He gave me a hard Iuck story
about his kid and I bought it.

412
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:46,511
Because you wanted to.

413
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:49,375
Now, how did this convict
get the phone number?

414
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:51,715
Rule was co-counsel
in his own defense.

415
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:55,483
The victim's information
was Iisted because she was
a witness at his trial.

416
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:58,390
I should put you on a desk
and send you over
to the Shachtman residence

417
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,654
to explain yourself.

418
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:01,252
I already did that.

419
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,294
How's she doing?

420
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:13,268
She feels violated. Again.

421
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:22,380
I'II call Brooklyn.
See if I can't smooth it over.

422
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:28,253
Vivian Parish.
She may have married.

423
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:30,587
Can you check who's paying
her quarterlies? I'II hold.

424
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:35,418
Tell me again how my partner
failed to get his
weapon recertification.

425
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:37,624
He choked.
I didn't choke.

426
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:40,361
Okay. He got poor marks
for shooting off
his gun early.

427
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:43,302
That happens to everybody,
Fin. You know,
they have a pill for that now.

428
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:48,132
So what's your next move?

429
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:50,978
I don't have one. I mean...

430
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:53,776
Brodus has another cellmate
but he's not talking to us.

431
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:57,011
BENSON: Anything on the guy
you can use,
something to twist him with?

432
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:00,316
He murdered a kid
in a convenience
store robbery.

433
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:04,188
Shot him point blank
with a sawed-off. Converted
to Islam on the inside.

434
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,193
He's made one appeal since.

435
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:09,355
I suppose he wanted
his execution date moved up.

436
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:11,990
Yeah. How do you know?

437
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,295
He's on a path.

438
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:16,804
It's the one thing
Christianity, Judaism
and Islam have in common.

439
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:20,398
In order to be a man of God,
you gotta change
the man you are.

440
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:23,808
Can't you appeal to this guy's
religion? I mean, you're
Iooking to clear a murder.

441
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:26,039
That's gotta mean something
if his conversion's real.

442
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:28,241
FIN: He's got a blood debt.
Use that.

443
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:29,340
BIood debt?

444
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:34,047
It's in the Koran.
He took a Iife, so he owes
a debt for spilling blood.

445
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:35,919
It's Islamic justice.

446
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,625
DANIEL: How can I help you,
Detective?

447
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:44,328
PIease believe me that if
there were any other way,
I wouldn't be here.

448
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:47,891
I've caused victims
enough grief already.

449
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:54,869
Sir, I'm here to request
that you face
your son's killer

450
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:56,570
and ask him to talk to us.

451
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:59,670
Why? Why would you ever
ask me to do that?

452
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:03,149
He may have some information
to give another grieving
family some relief.

453
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,584
I can't.
I believe you can, sir.

454
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:08,846
In my opinion,

455
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:12,026
any man who opposed
the death sentence

456
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:15,859
on behalf of his son's killer
is strong enough to face him.

457
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,898
I don't give a damn
what you think.

458
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:22,198
Yes, I spoke at his
sentencing. But I didn't do it
for him. I did it for me.

459
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,502
His death doesn't Iessen
my pain and it sure as hell
doesn't give me back my son.

460
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,770
I apologize
for reopening your wounds.

461
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,244
You didn't.

462
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:34,110
My wounds never heal.

463
00:23:35,717 --> 00:23:38,447
At Ieast you know
who killed your child.

464
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:41,417
Debbie Cooper's parents don't.

465
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,197
Why is he in chains?

466
00:23:57,272 --> 00:23:59,797
With a civilian in the room,
we take extra precautions.

467
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:04,903
I'm told
you're a religious man now.

468
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,140
I owe you a debt.

469
00:24:07,215 --> 00:24:08,580
DANIEL: You can't pay it.

470
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,711
So I need you to talk
to these men. Answer their
questions and try not to Iie.

471
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:16,213
Questions about what?

472
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,690
STABLER: Matthew Brodus.

473
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,955
I don't really know the man.

474
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:25,394
You shared a cell with him
for three years. What were
your impressions of him?

475
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:28,326
He's a killer.

476
00:24:28,403 --> 00:24:29,961
So you have a Iot in common.

477
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:37,133
He used to always
ask me questions.

478
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:39,343
What kind of questions?

479
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:42,850
Why I was on death row.
Who I killed.

480
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,609
How I did it.

481
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,322
My answers
used to piss him off.

482
00:24:52,594 --> 00:24:56,086
That's because
you killed a young man
that you didn't hunt first,

483
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:59,065
and so Brodus couldn't
get a vicarious thrill
from your experience.

484
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:01,567
I shot that boy
'cause he saw my face.

485
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:06,065
But Brodus,
he took joy in the killing.

486
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:12,612
One night, he talked to me
about all the things he did.

487
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,506
I asked to be moved
out of there after that.

488
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:16,914
What kind of things?

489
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,684
Stalking, gutting,

490
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,014
doing things to the body.

491
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:26,088
He used to think
he was smarter
than everybody else

492
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,025
even when he made a mistake.

493
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:30,064
He killed a blind girl
close to home.

494
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,024
Did he say how he did it?

495
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:38,395
No, and I didn't ask.

496
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:44,038
Can I go now,
back to my cell?

497
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:47,138
Evening prayers, you know?

498
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:49,945
Officer.

499
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:57,290
You refused to speak
during your sentencing.

500
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:03,254
I need to know what my son's
Iast moments were Iike.

501
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,729
Did he say anything?

502
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,232
No, sir.

503
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:16,540
You don't need the image of
your boy dying with my voice
in your head telling you how.

504
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,276
Leroy Russell confirms
Brodus blinded and murdered
one of his victims

505
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:26,752
that was too close to home.

506
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:29,016
None of the New Jersey victims
match Leroy's story.

507
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,114
That doesn't mean anything.

508
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:32,216
It's hearsay testimony
from a man on death row.

509
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:34,284
Munch Iocated that teacher,
Vivian Parish.

510
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:36,387
Not only did she date Brodus
for six months,

511
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,989
he regularly picked her up
from school and, I quote,

512
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,932
"Gave Debbie Cooper
a ride home once or twice."

513
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,266
Now is that enough
for a murder indictment?

514
00:26:43,338 --> 00:26:47,001
And as soon as I file,
they'II say we can have
him when they're done.

515
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:48,508
So that's it?
We're done trying?

516
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:50,544
What else can we do?

517
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:53,576
Explain it to her parents.

518
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,846
I understand
we have new evidence.

519
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:02,520
So where do we go from here,
Miss Cabot?

520
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,616
I'm not sure
what I can give you
besides knowledge.

521
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:11,429
Can you prove
that Matthew Brodus
killed our daughter?

522
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,524
Not in a court of Iaw.

523
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:17,230
But we are reasonably sure
he's guilty and he is being
executed for his crimes.

524
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:20,138
Are you familiar
with the name Ottis Toole?

525
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:25,638
He's the guy every cop
believes murdered John Walsh's
six-year-old son, Adam.

526
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:28,273
Toole died of AIDS
on death row
before we could prove it.

527
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:31,614
And after 21 years
you can still see
the rage and grief

528
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:33,654
that John Walsh
carries with him.

529
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:37,314
His hope died
along with his son's killer.

530
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:40,450
If you don't do everything
within your power

531
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:43,827
to prove Matthew Brodus
murdered our daughter,
so will ours.

532
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:52,797
I'm Wade Harris,
Matthew Brodus' Iead counsel.

533
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:54,364
Nice to meet you.

534
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:57,673
Frankly, I'm blown away
that the Manhattan
D.A.'s office

535
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,906
is interested
in stopping this execution.

536
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:03,041
We're not.
I want to put your client
on trial for murder.

537
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:05,108
That should buy you
six months to a year.

538
00:28:05,186 --> 00:28:08,349
No, actually, I think
I could drag it out to 18,
if I drown you in paper.

539
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:10,584
I've drafted the request
for a temporary
restraining order.

540
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:13,024
And what makes you so sure
a judge will go for it?

541
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:16,257
Evidence and an appeal
from the victim's parents.

542
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:18,563
What kind of evidence?

543
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,132
You file capital charges
against my client,
I have right to discovery.

544
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:25,536
Only when and if I file.

545
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:30,267
You need to keep
your client alive.
Right now, I'm all you've got.

546
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:32,237
Deal?

547
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,979
Miss Cabot?

548
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:46,850
Your Honor,
the People are seeking
a temporary restraining order

549
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:50,091
based on new evidence
Iinking Matthew Brodus
to an open homicide.

550
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:52,689
None of which is under
New Jersey's
Iegal jurisdiction.

551
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,860
As officers of the court,
we cannot ignore
capital crimes,

552
00:28:54,936 --> 00:28:56,028
no matter where they occur.

553
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:59,164
I've reviewed their evidence
and it's circumstantial
at best

554
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,836
and doesn't even meet the
criteria for trial, not here
and certainly not in New York.

555
00:29:04,312 --> 00:29:06,576
Is Manhattan proposing
to try Mr. Brodus?

556
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:07,944
Not at this time, Your Honor.

557
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:11,473
So is the purpose of the TRO
to go on a fishing expedition?

558
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,487
Your Honor, the Iaw
does not allow for
posthumous jurisprudence.

559
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:18,184
If Mr. Brodus dies before
discovery has been had,
the truth dies with him.

560
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:20,557
This is a ploy
to stay the execution,
Your Honor.

561
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,459
The defense
has exhausted their appeals

562
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,521
and are now preying
on New York's desperation.

563
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,624
I submit, the prisoner
is in your custody

564
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:28,862
and available to be executed
at your discretion.

565
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,769
Which is currently scheduled
for midnight tonight.

566
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,467
We should not allow them
to stymie our ability
to mete justice.

567
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,773
The prisoner will be
just as dead
six months from now.

568
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:40,643
Your Honor,
we're not seeking justice,
we're only seeking the truth.

569
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:43,741
Under the circumstances,
and given
who the defendant is,

570
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:46,719
I'm not convinced
you'II be able to get it.

571
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:49,345
AII right, people,
don't go far.

572
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,092
So what are our chances?

573
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:58,098
It's hard to gauge.
I'd say we're about even.

574
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:01,663
So what's with the face?
You're acting Iike
we've already Iost.

575
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:04,000
Something about
helping a convicted
serial killer

576
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:07,871
avoid the needle
he so justly deserves
does not sit well with me.

577
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:11,705
Is the judge back?
Not yet.

578
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:15,881
Are you only Iooking
for an exceptional clearance?

579
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,317
An interview
is all we've ever asked for.
Nothing's changed.

580
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:22,753
I need your word
that you'II decline
to prosecute,

581
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:24,655
no matter what Brodus
reveals to you.

582
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:27,617
You've got it.

583
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:32,457
I'II set up the interview.
Be ready in an hour.

584
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:39,068
HUANG:
Try to keep him off balance.

585
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,506
When I stress him,
be his friend.
Otherwise push him hard.

586
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:43,407
You'II be watching
his body Ianguage
for signals.

587
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:46,344
When you ask
an innocuous question,
I'II just back off.

588
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:50,083
And pay attention to his eyes.
Serial killers
have this stare.

589
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:52,676
It's focused.
It's Iike animals
when they're hunting.

590
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:54,277
And when he's not hunting?

591
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:56,721
Then he can't Iook you
in the eye.

592
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:58,381
Anything else?

593
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,387
You know,
this might not work.

594
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,627
He's not going to trust us
and he might
play this out to the end.

595
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:06,132
You gotta be prepared,
in case we run out of time.

596
00:31:20,882 --> 00:31:22,110
Hey.

597
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,944
Detective Stabler.

598
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,287
I'm Dr. George Huang.

Behavioral science.

600
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:36,927
Prescient spooks
studying rats in a cage.
How boring.

601
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:40,299
STABLER: You're not boring,
Mr. Brodus.

602
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:42,568
You can call me Matt,

603
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:45,700
EIIiot.

604
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:50,766
I'm not a mind reader.
They just announce
my visitors.

605
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:53,002
So what's this about?

606
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,174
Well, we just decided
to take you up
on your invitation.

607
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,686
Not that I mind the company,
but I don't recall
inviting you.

608
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:04,915
You also don't seem
too surprised
to be seeing us.

609
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:08,358
Why should I be?
Feds come in and out all day.

610
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:12,799
You been helping us out?

611
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,627
As much as I can.

612
00:32:15,236 --> 00:32:18,171
But they want me
to admit to things
I haven't done.

613
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:22,505
If it wasn't for the missing
women and their poor families,
I'd Iaugh.

614
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:26,146
At what?
You cops.

615
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:30,179
Trying to beat your own clock.

(CLEARS THROAT)

617
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,853
What's so special
about Our Lady of Light?

618
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:43,628
That a church?

619
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:46,928
Catholic high school.
You mentioned you wanted
to send your daughter there.

620
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:52,165
I want her to have
a first-class education.

621
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,403
You don't have
any children, Matt.

622
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:57,068
You sure about that?

623
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,814
You think any woman's
gonna come forward
with my kid?

624
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:05,852
Much Iess admit to having
slept with me? Come on.

625
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,717
How about you give me a name,
and I'II check it out?

626
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:10,723
You'II have to wait
until my will
goes into probate.

627
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,962
Why didn't you kill
your girlfriend,
Vivian Parish?

628
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,566
Now you're insulting me.

629
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:25,002
Well, I don't want to do that.
I apologize. It just seems
that if you'd killed her,

630
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,903
you probably would've
gotten pinched right away

631
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:29,499
and 13 women
would still be alive.

632
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:31,875
We all know
the record says 12.

633
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,675
We both know
the record is incorrect.

634
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:46,790
They give you anything
for that insomnia, Matt?

635
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:49,352
Pills don't work.
What time is it?

636
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:52,866
It's 8:33.

637
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:58,228
What's in the folder?
It's a project.

638
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:00,603
I want to ask your opinion
about a killer's M.O.

639
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,868
He still out there?

640
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:06,242
Don't know.
He hasn't worked in a while.

641
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:10,511
We wanted to go through the
three D's of sadism: dread,
dependency, degradation.

642
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:12,347
Are you up for that?

643
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:16,680
Can I take a Iook, please?

644
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:29,935
What's this?

645
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:32,370
A medical examiner's report
on the body.

646
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:36,499
That's boring. Where are
the crime scene photos?

647
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,909
There's a picture
under the report.

648
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:41,641
It says our killer
tortured the victim.

649
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,940
Any ideas why?

650
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:55,753
No.
HUANG: Why not?

651
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,957
You did
some of the same things
to your victims.

652
00:34:58,032 --> 00:34:59,659
The big girls that you chose.

653
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,394
Since Debbie Cooper
was a big girl,

654
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:05,200
we figured you might
have some ideas why
she was cut so deeply.

655
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:08,503
If I could see
some crime scene photos,
I could probably help you.

656
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:12,137
You don't need them.
Look inside your head.
You'II see it.

657
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:16,779
See someone else's work?
Can't be done.

658
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:18,746
STABLER: He overpowers her.

659
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,182
Easy for a man of some size,
Iike you.

660
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,920
He binds her tight with tape.
PIays with her for a while.

661
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:30,253
HUANG:
He feeds off her terror.

662
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:35,392
He can't get enough,
so that she dreads when
he Ieaves and when he returns.

663
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:39,599
But he's not
gonna do her right away.
He wants a few days with her.

664
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:41,374
So now she has
to depend on him.

665
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:43,569
But then he has
to take the thing
and slice it open

666
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:46,010
and see what's
going on in there.

667
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:49,311
The knife goes in Iike butter.

668
00:35:50,284 --> 00:35:52,081
It's so warm inside.

669
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:56,587
But he has to be
quick about it.
It'II be cold soon.

670
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:59,124
STABLER: Why does he have
to be quick now?

671
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:01,053
To be born again.

672
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:05,363
Are we talking religion now?

673
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:09,334
No. Where's the one place
that your mother
can never Ieave you?

674

Psychiatric pap.
You always blame Mom.

676
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:19,737
Yeah, yeah. Well, why not?
I mean, Iook at your mother.

677
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:20,905
Leave her out of this.

678
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:24,610
She couldn't stand you.
She Ieft you
with your grandparents.

679
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,017
When they died,
she shipped you off
to foster care.

680
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,645
She came and got me.
She Ioved me.

681
00:36:28,722 --> 00:36:33,682
Matt, tell the truth.
She got married. She had a
daughter with her new husband.

682
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:38,391
And when she Ieft him,
she took your half-sister
with her and Ieft you behind.

683
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:42,026
Again. I mean, obviously,
she must have Ioathed you.

684
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:45,731
She saw the real you
and it made her want to vomit.

685
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,702
How many times did she
tell you she wished
you'd been aborted?

686
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:53,042
She never said that.
She Ioved me.
She never said that, ever.

687
00:36:58,852 --> 00:36:59,910
I'm done talking to you.

688
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:02,751
We're not finished, Matt.
You're helping us
with this one case.

689
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:04,654
We've covered dread
and dependency.

690
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,091
Now we're gonna see
how Debbie Cooper
was degraded.

691
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:09,220
How many times was the killer
with her postmortem, huh?

692
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:12,129
What are you talking about?
That's obscene.

693
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,427
Just think Iike the killer.
Go ahead.
How should I know?

694
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:17,970
Ask the shrink.
He's probably treated
psychos Iike that.

695
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:21,337
It depends on how often
the killer visited the body.

696
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:24,703
How many times
did you check on your victims?

697
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:29,948
Hey, I only went back
to see if they were still
where I Ieft them. That's all.

698
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:33,052
Not this guy. He went back
to be with them, you know?

699
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,283
I can't help you.

700
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:44,660
Do you believe I'm gonna think
any Iess of you?

701
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:48,031
I'm telling you, I never
messed around with them
after they were dead.

702
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:50,093
The guy you're Iooking for
is sick. Real sick.

703

What woman alive
would be with you, though?

Vivian Parish.

705
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:57,842
I talked with her. She said
you had a tough time
closing the deal.

706
00:37:57,911 --> 00:38:00,038
Well, if she said that,
then the bitch Iied.

707
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,014
You're a cop, you're supposed
to tell the difference.

708
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:04,482
Oh, I can and I do.

709
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:08,982
It's in their nature.
They say they don't want it
but they really do.

710
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:11,081
No means yes. Yes means no.

711
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:14,650
You know, I should've
disappeared the whore
before she went out west.

712
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:16,662
I missed my chance
by 20 minutes.

713
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,357
But she knew who you were
and she was way ahead of you.

714
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:20,593
She was an idiot,
a moon-eyed cow.

715
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:23,466
Debbie just wanted someone
to tell her ugly ass
that she was pretty.

716
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:26,802
Thought she was
in a Harlequin romance.
Stupid bitch.

No, it's not. None of them
are named Debbie or Deborah.

721

match, either.

wasn't required,
I wouldn't be here.

cannot stomach the reality?

00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:17,012
Any news on Huang?

745
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:19,450
He's going to be okay,
but they want to
keep him overnight.

746
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,080
And Brodus?
He's on a ventilator.

747
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:24,620
I have to tell the families.
I'II do it.

748
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:25,715
I think you've done enough.

749
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:29,194
They need to know
that he planned this.
I'II explain it to them.

750
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:33,324
The only thing
that matters to them is
we can't execute him now.

751
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,961
The state can't execute
an unhealthy man.
It's the Iaw.

752
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:39,801
So as Iong as he's in a coma,
we can't get justice.
What a waste.

753
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:43,639
You're wrong.
I got a confession
on Debbie Cooper.

754
00:40:48,515 --> 00:40:50,449
MESSINGER: They won't care.

755
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:53,316
Would you?

756
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,682
Go home.

757
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,562
