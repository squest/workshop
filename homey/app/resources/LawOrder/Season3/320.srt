00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:00,164
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:03,933
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:05,099
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:08,109
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:11,738
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:13,782
These are their stories,

7
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:18,719
My wife didn't turn
the alarm on again.

8
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:21,052
TAYLOR: I never turn mine on
when I'm home.

9
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:23,282
Wow.

10
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:26,184
My entire apartment
would fit in here.

11
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:29,129
Original detail,
huge fireplace.

12
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:32,656
I have two more of those.
One in the den,
one in the master bedroom.

13
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:35,226
You should
turn this place
into your restaurant.

14
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:37,704
Can't be more elegant.
Well, you know,
that's all Jessie.

15
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:40,607
She's got the sense of style.
She's got an eye...

16
00:00:40,977 --> 00:00:42,103
Jess?

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,707
Maybe she's out.

18
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:46,976
No. She had no plans to...

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,183
(JESSICA MOANING)
Jessica?

20
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:52,549
Jessica?

21
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,254
The phone's over there!
Dial 911!

22
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:56,518
TAYLOR: Oh, my God.

23
00:00:56,592 --> 00:00:58,890
Honey, I'm here, Jess.

24
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:01,191
Victim is Jessica BIaine-Todd,
early 40s.

25
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:03,732
Husband and a friend
found her
raped and bludgeoned.

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,926
BIudgeoned with what?

27
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,263
Haven't found it, yet.

28
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:07,393
He was upstairs, too.

29
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,495
Drawers pulled out
everywhere,
closets emptied.

30
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:10,698
We're gonna be here
for a while.

31
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:12,934
Front door Iooks clean.
Come in through a window?

32
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,909
No sign of forced entry
anywhere in the house.

33
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:16,842
Was the alarm on?
TODD: No.

34
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:18,141
Not when I came in,

35
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:20,614
but there's a panic button
in every room.

36
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:22,810
We just had them installed.

37
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,082
I'm Jessica's husband,
Edwin Todd.

38
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:28,021
Detectives
Benson and Stabler,
Special Victims Unit.

39
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:29,388
Did your wife
say anything?

40
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:30,585
No. Nothing.

41
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,321
Just...
I found her moaning.

42
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:34,192
And you were with a friend
when you found her?

43
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:35,560
Yeah. My real estate guy.

44
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:38,464
We'd just put
a deposit on a space
for my new restaurant.

45
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:40,365
We went out to celebrate.

46
00:01:40,436 --> 00:01:41,425
How's she doing?

47
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:43,495
Fractured skull,
drifting in and out
of consciousness.

48
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:44,767
We're trying to
get the pressure up.

49
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:46,832
Mrs. Todd,
I'm Detective Benson.

50
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,638
Can you tell me
what happened?

51
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:51,544
Isn't the sunset beautiful?

52
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:53,912
She's not
moving her right side,
and her speech is slurred.

53
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,883
BIows to the head
might've caused a stroke.

54
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:57,317
BP's stable. Let's go.

55
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:01,417
I'm right with you, Jess.

56
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:05,990
There's three fireplaces,
could've come through
the chimney.

57
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:08,428
Maybe we should be Iooking
for a guy in a red suit.

58
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:58,941
What's the prognosis?

59
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:03,384
Jessica is paralyzed
on her right side
and can't speak.

60
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:07,681
They say the next
48 hours are critical.

61
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:10,191
And are you
up for answering
any more questions?

62
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,726
Anything.

63
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:14,388
BENSON: Was the door closed
and Iocked when you came home?

64
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:15,794
Yes.

65
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:20,325
But Jessica always forgets
to turn on the alarm
when she's in the house.

66
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:22,997
Mr. Todd, aside from
you and your wife,

67
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,336
does anybody else
have access?

68
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:27,501
Our cleaning Iady, Katarina.

69
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:30,777
She knows the codes.
She has a spare set of keys.

70
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:33,144
As a matter of fact,
I just gave her a new set.

71
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:35,616
Why? Did she Iose hers?
No, no, no.

72
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:38,711
There's been
a string of break-ins
in the neighborhood.

73
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:42,019
That's why I upgraded
the alarm system
and changed the Iocks,

74
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,719
to prevent something
Iike this from happening.

75
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:45,852
Edwin Todd was right.

76
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:47,919
Six burglaries in the Iast
month in his neighborhood.

77
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,396
STABLER: Bad guys go
where the money is.

78
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:51,296
Any of these break-ins
turn violent?

79
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:52,425
This was the first.

80
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,594
Precinct squad says
their perp usually breaks in

81
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,036
through a window
or door though,
not Iike our guy.

82
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:59,540
Well, plenty of rapists
start out as burglars.

83
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:01,609
Maybe he's refining
his act.

84
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:05,169
No current burglaries
anywhere else in Manhattan
with Iast night's M.O.

85
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,217
Well, make sure we also
run down any old burglaries

86
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:09,512
where the perps
turned violent

87
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,780
and either made parole
or finished doing their time.

88
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,981
Any chance
she accidentally
Ieft the door open?

89
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:15,489
Can't.
It's on a spring Iock.

90
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:17,025
And it Iocks automatically.

91
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:18,321
What about the cleaning woman?

92
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:19,918
Her name's Katarina Dinov.

93
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:22,055
Naturalized from the Ukraine,
no rap sheet.

94
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,928
We're heading out to
talk to her right now.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,729
Well, this started out
as a burglary.

96
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:28,827
The victim's husband
should know by now
if anything's missing.

97
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:30,735
Captain, you got a second?

98
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,205
CRAGEN: What's up, John?

99
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:35,338
Bad timing.
I got jury duty in an hour.

100
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:37,845
And you're
just telling me now?
Get your ass down there.

101
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:39,312
It's your civic duty,
John.

102
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:41,111
The Mayor can do it,
so can you.

103
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:43,708
I'II go with you to talk
to the cleaning Iady.

104
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:46,582
Thanks.

105
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:51,782
Jerry BIaine,
Jess's first husband,
was an investment banker.

106
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:55,797
He did a deal for me,
made me a Iot of money.

107
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,526
We stayed in touch.

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,761
You're not from here?
No, Seattle.

109
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:03,228
I couldn't make it
to Jerry's funeral,

110
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:06,070
so I made sure that
the next time I came
to town

111
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:07,905
I took Jessica
out to dinner.

112
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:10,070
That must have
been awkward for you
to see each other again

113
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:11,545
under the circumstances.

114
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:13,844
No, actually,
we'd never met.

115
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,918
But something hit
both of us that night.

116
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:19,546
You know, as if we had
known each other always.

117
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:23,516
I Iost my wife
three years ago to cancer.

118
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:27,084
Jessica understood exactly
what I was going through.

119
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,125
We married at
her summer house

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,259
on Martha's Vineyard
a year Iater.

121
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:37,700
Can you think of any reason
why someone would want to
hurt your wife?

122
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:39,866
No. Everybody Ioves her.

123
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:47,215
Are you missing something?

124
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,808
Yeah. Jessica's watch.

125
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:53,150
I can't remember if she was
wearing it when we found her.

126
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:54,883
BENSON: Well, where does
she usually keep it?

127
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:58,552
Right here
on the night table
when she goes to sleep.

128
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:00,891
The rest of the jewelry's
in the safe.

129
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:04,399
Not on the Iist of
what CSU sent to the Iab.
What kind of watch is it?

130
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,866
TODD: Rolex.

131
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:07,266
What's its value?

132
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:09,429
35,000.

133
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:15,240
It's horrible what happened
to Mrs. BIaine.

134
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:17,641
I thought her Iast name
was Todd.

135
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:20,742
I can't get used
to her new name.

136
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,741
Mr. BIaine was a Iovely man.

137
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,845
AIways took time
to ask me how I was.

138
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,014
They divorced?

139
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,124
He drowned on vacation
in the Bahamas two years ago.

140
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:36,388
When did Mr. Todd
come into the picture?

141
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,933
Not Iong after
Mr. BIaine died.

142
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,969
Sounds Iike you mean
not Iong enough.

143
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:44,870
When Mr. BIaine was alive,
I Iived in their house
five years,

144
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:48,740
but Mr. Todd made me move out
because he wanted his privacy.

145
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:50,467
You Iive with someone?

146
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:51,604
My boyfriend.

147
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,942
He got a name?

148
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,448
Andrei Gorsky.

149
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,041
CRAGEN:
Where was he Iast night?

150
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:59,281
He's a Iimo driver.
He worked until 4:00
in the morning.

151
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:01,414
I was at my neighbor's
waiting for him.

152
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,253
Andrei took my keys
by mistake.

153
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,316
I couldn't get in
until he came home.

154
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:08,921
Yesterday was my day off.

155
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:11,193
Let's see. Gorsky.

156
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:14,299
Nope, didn't work Iast night.
You sure?

157
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,497
He's not in the Iog,
he wasn't driving.

158
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:19,405
Well, does
he have a cell phone,
someway we can find him?

159
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,568
Yeah.
He's the one vacuuming
out his car in the back,

160
00:07:21,644 --> 00:07:23,111
just about to go on shift.

161
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,875
Hey, Gorsky!
You got visitors!

162
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:31,315
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

163
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,215
Don't even think about it.

164
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,194
Must've been
something we said.

165
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:42,196
That any way
to treat company?

166
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:43,731
Where were you Iast night?

167
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:46,290
This is a free country.
I go where I please.

168
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,928
You know the people
Katarina works for?
Mr. and Mrs. Todd?

169
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:50,528
Well, I drive them
to the airport.

170
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:52,198
So you've been
to their house.

171
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,571
How much you get
for the Rolex?

172
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:55,371
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

173
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:56,536
Sure you do.

174
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:57,840
You had Katarina's keys.

175
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,312
You went to
the Upper East Side,

176
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:02,043
you took Mrs. Todd's watch,
and you raped her.

177
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,243
Rape?

178
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:09,220
I didn't rape anybody,
and I didn't steal a watch.

179
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,816
I forgot I had Katarina's
keys, man. This is crazy.

180
00:08:11,894 --> 00:08:13,691
And it's the Iast chance
you get to tell us the truth.

181
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,821
Where were you Iast night?

182
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,032
With someone.

183
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,795
Well, you told Katarina
you were working.

184
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,769
Well, I was with
my other girlfriend.

185
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:22,997
Is she gonna verify that?

186
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:24,539
'Cause you really don't
want to waste my time.

187
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,199
I'II give you
her phone number.

188
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:29,472
CRAGEN:
If you didn't do anything,
Andrei, why'd you try to run?

189
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,276
Let me see your green card.

190
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:36,411
I don't have one.

191
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:37,816
FIN:
How'd you get in the country?

192
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,878
Student visa,
three years ago.

193
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,820
CRAGEN: And instead of
going to school,
you went to work.

194
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,722
You better kiss
your two girlfriends goodbye.

195
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,692
Immigration's cracking down
on cats Iike you.

196
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,388
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

197
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:48,925
(GROANS)

198
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:53,098
If I give you information,
can I stay?

199
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,795
We'II tell INS
you cooperated,

200
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,360
if we Iike what we hear.

201
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:01,074
Mrs. Todd,

202
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:05,409
Katarina heard her
fight with her husband
the day before it happened.

203
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,285
Mr. Todd,
how have you and your
wife been getting along?

204
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:16,722
Fine.
We heard you had
a Iittle fight.

205
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:19,886
Oh,
Katarina must have told you.

206
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:22,260
The Iast few weeks,
I have spent so much time

207
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:25,300
Iooking for the right Iocation
for this restaurant,

208
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,200
interviewing managers,
vendors.

209
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,171
I told her that
as soon as we got
this place up and running,

210
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,006
we would have more
time for each other,
and she understood.

211
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:36,669
Yeah, we have to
ask you this question.

212
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:39,213
Were you and your wife
intimate before the attack?

213
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,912
The night before. Why?

214
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:45,886
We'd Iike you to agree
to a simple DNA test.

215
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,947
Oh, is the husband
always a suspect?

216
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:50,924
It's so the Iab
can differentiate

217
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:53,791
your residual DNA
from the attacker's.

218
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,523
The test is really
for your protection.

219
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:57,498
You just tell me
where and when.

220
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:58,965
(RINGING)

221
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:00,433
Excuse me.

222
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:01,867
Hello?

223
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,370
It's nice to know
I'm not the only one

224
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,873
catching grief
for working all the time.

225
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,067
Thank God.

226
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:08,200
Your wife?

227
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:10,837
It was the hospital.
She's conscious.

228
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,211
Excuse me.

229
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:18,650
STABLER: Can she talk?
TODD: No.

230
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:21,246
But the hospital
gave us a dry erase board

231
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,188
so she could
write everything down.

232
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:25,321
BENSON: Mrs. Todd,

233
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,494
do you remember me
from the night of
your attack?

234
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:30,222
(MOANING)

235
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:31,561
STABLER: We're the police.

236
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:34,569
Is there anything you can
remember about what happened?

237
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:41,871
TODD: "Put on robe"'

238
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:44,635
"Thought Ed"'

239
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,340
You thought I was home?

240
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:49,907
Why, Mrs. Todd?
What made you think
your husband was home?

241
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:53,220
TODD: "Heard"'

242
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:57,755
"Heard key in door"'

243
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,992
She heard the key
in the door.

244
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,526
TREVOR: The only way to
tell if a Iock's been picked

245
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:08,229
is if the perp forgot to
turn the cylinder back.

246
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:11,170
The Todd's front doorknob
Iocks automatically
when the door closes.

247
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,537
STABLER:
So there's no way to tell.

248
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,371
If it was picked,
your guy's a pro.

249
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:16,001
No help there.

250
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,675
This should be.

251
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:22,444
Computer came up
with a match on the DNA
we found in Jessica Todd.

252
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:24,509
We have a suspect?
Another victim.

253
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:27,248
Rape-burglary two weeks ago,
Brooklyn Heights.

254
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,321
My wife told the other
detectives everything.

255
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,663
STABLER: We're sorry to make
you go through this again,
Mrs. Johansen,

256
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:41,259
but whoever attacked you

257
00:11:41,336 --> 00:11:44,396
Ieft another victim
in Manhattan unable
to walk or talk.

258
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:49,171
Anything you can remember
might help us get this guy
off the street.

259
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:54,839
Curtis was out of town.

260
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,817
A merger meeting
in Saint Louis.

261
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,117
I was in the bedroom reading
when I heard a noise.

262
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,159
I Iooked up
and there was a man
standing in the door.

263
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,660
It says on the report that
you couldn't describe him.

264
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,289
I told the detectives
I didn't see his face.

265
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:13,198
He was wearing
a stocking over his head.

266
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:16,600
BENSON: Do you remember
what else he was wearing?

267
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:21,037
Regular clothes.
Jeans, maybe sneakers.

268
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,777
And gloves.
Did he say anything?

269
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,914
When I started to scream,

270
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:34,915
he put a gun to my head,
and he...

271
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:38,484
He told me he'd kill me
if I didn't stop.

272
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:45,392
There was no emotion
in his voice.

273
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,328
He just told me to

274
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:51,129
take off my clothes.

275
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,273
Then he...

276
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:05,245
He didn't say another word.

277
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:11,691
When he was done,
he went out the front door.

278
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,259
And he in no way
tried to hit you?

279
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:19,323
Isn't what he did to me
enough?

280
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:22,666
Mrs. Johansen, think hard.

281
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:26,097
Are you sure that you
didn't hear him come in?

282
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:28,903
No.

283
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:31,502
STABLER:
You told the other detectives

284
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,310
the attacker stole
a diamond bracelet worth

285
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:37,611
$100,000. Is that accurate?

286
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:41,178
Two-carat stones
all the way around.
I had it made for Denise.

287
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:44,225
I just gave it to her
for our six-month anniversary.

288
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:47,820
Mrs. Johansen, is it possible
you Ieft the front door
unlocked or open?

289
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:51,923
Our security system chirps
if the door is Ieft open
for more than 30 seconds.

290
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,492
And the new doorknob
Iocks automatically.

291
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,961
New doorknob?

292
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:02,366
We had the Iocks replaced
about a month ago.

293
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:04,172
I Iost my keys.

294
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:06,214
We didn't want
to take any chances.

295
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:09,378
STABLER: Do you have
the name of that Iocksmith?

296
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:12,882
Parks Safe and Security,
Manhattan.

297
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:17,654
I checked the computer.
We did both jobs.

298
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,923
Same Iocksmith?
Yeah, Danny Ryan,
he's one of my best.

299
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,554
What is this about?

300
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:24,462
Are all your
employees bonded?

301
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,831
Yeah. Fingerprints and
thorough background checks.

302
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:28,631
The whole works.

303
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,535
You wanna tell me
what's going on here?

304
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,301
It's just part of
an investigation.

305
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:34,342
Where could we find Ryan
right now?

306
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:35,876
Well, he's out on a job.

307
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:41,976
58 and Broadway.

308
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:45,645
Monday night?
I was studying
in the Iibrary

309
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:47,916
at the Jefferson College
of Criminal Justice.

310
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,958
You coming to
the Police Department?

311
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,720
Actually,
I'm shooting for Iaw school.

312
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,988
I'm a Iocksmith
during the day,
go to school at night.

313
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:56,587
Anybody see you
cracking the books
in the Iibrary?

314
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:59,532
The woman at the front desk
when I showed her my ID.

315
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,659
I didn't talk to anybody.

316
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,398
I mean, I go there
to study, not socialize.

317
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:05,463
How about two weeks ago
Iast night?

318
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,632
Are you kidding me?

319
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,233
I can't even remember
what I had for breakfast
this morning.

320
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,575
What do you say
you try a Iittle harder?

321
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:15,242
Look, any one of us
would be crazy to break
into a customer's house.

322
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:18,309
I mean, they checked me
out for criminal record,
bad credit,

323
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,685
everything, before
they Iet me do this job.

324
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,781
Look, I put the Iocks
into those two brownstones,

325
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,223
but I never went back.

326
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:29,560
The DNA on Edwin Todd is in.
He's clear. It's not a match.

327
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,962
What about Ryan?

328
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,297
No rap sheet,
not even a speeding ticket.

329
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:35,563
Benson.
We canvassed the Iibrary
at Jefferson.

330
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,832
Guard doesn't remember Ryan
checking in Monday night.

331
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:39,669
Maybe that's
because the Iab
just found his prints

332
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:42,175
at both the Todd
and Johansen crime scenes.

333
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:46,146
That doesn't help us unless
they found them somewhere
other than the front door.

334
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:47,511
Yeah, how about
both front doors,

335
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:50,016
plus the Todd's kitchen
and the Johansen's bedroom?

336
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,677
Go pick him up.

337
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:54,688
I told you,
I don't wear rubber gloves
when I install Iocks.

338
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:56,280
Of course my prints
were in both houses.

339
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:59,486
BENSON: Denise Johansen
was raped in her bedroom.

340
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:02,428
Your prints were also
found in her bedroom.

341
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:04,328
That's a Iong way
from the front door, Danny.

342
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,889
The place in Brooklyn Heights?

343
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:07,230
The Iady asked me
to take a Iook

344
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:09,065
at the Iockset
in the master bath.

345
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,332
Said it was sticking.
I fixed it for her.

346
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:15,843
Guy Iike you, good-Iooking
women alone in their houses,

347
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,970
they must come on to you
all the time, right?

348
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,810
It happens,
but I'm not into that.

349
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:23,075
She make a move on you?

350
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,551
I'm telling you, no.

351
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,053
I didn't make a move on her,
either.

352
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:29,113
BENSON: Well, what about
when you did the Todd's house?

353
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:31,819
Hey, she wasn't even there!
Just the husband was home.

354
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:34,885
She was raped
and nearly beaten
to death in her kitchen.

355
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:38,126
Again, your prints
found all over the place.

356
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,929
Were you fixing
a Iock in there, too?

357
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:41,526
I was thirsty.

358
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:42,934
I asked for a glass of water.

359
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:45,166
I had it in the kitchen.
Just ask him.

360
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,765
You can count on that.
Now, what did you do
with the Rolex

361
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:49,674
and the diamond bracelet
you stole from those houses?

362
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,940
Hey, I don't know
what you're talking about.

363
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:55,108
But I swear,
I didn't rape
or beat anybody.

364
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,576
I'm trying to
become a Iawyer.

365
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,781
Why would I ruin my Iife?

366
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:05,755
He'd make a good Iawyer.
He's got an answer
for everything.

367
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:07,886
I wish it was that easy.

368
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,523
We're bringing
the victims in
for a Iineup.

369
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:12,757
Cancel it.
Why?

370
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:15,466
Neither of them saw
their attackers' faces.

371
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:16,595
We've heard that before.

372
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:17,899
Then they come in,
Iook at the Iineup

373
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:19,873
and remember
more than they thought.

374
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,432
And when the victims
can't ID Ryan
and we take him to trial,

375
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,502
it's exculpatory evidence
and he walks.

376
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,807
Well, he's gonna walk
a Iot sooner

377
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:28,315
if we don't come up
with a reason to hold him.

378
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:30,214
Jessica Todd
barely survived.

379
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:32,378
His next victim
may not be so Iucky.

380
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:35,922
Fingerprints should be
enough to get warrants

381
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,391
for Ryan's DNA
and his apartment.

382
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,390
STABLER:
No watch or bracelet.

383
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:44,193
That was a waste of time.

384
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,528
If Ryan fenced that jewelry,

385
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,192
you couldn't tell
from that dump.

386
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,464
No keys. No mask.

387
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,267
And he doesn't
have a car.

388
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:56,043
Where else could he be
hiding that stash?

389
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:57,842
You're wrong about Ryan.

390
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:00,074
I told those
other detectives,
he's a good kid.

391
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:02,343
So help us clear him.

392
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:04,544
This is unit three.
This is the one
he drives.

393
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:05,813
Is this his alone?

394
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,946
Well, 8:00 to 4:00.
Two other guys drive it.

395
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:09,786
4:00 to midnight,
and graveyard shift.

396
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:10,950
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

397
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:13,051
Yeah. We need you to

398
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:16,029
sign this affidavit
giving us permission
to search the vehicle.

399
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,292
Yeah. Knock yourselves out.

400
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,026
You're not gonna
find anything.

401
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:23,769
Great. Thank you.

402
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:26,203
I'II take the front.

403
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,539
STABLER: Here we go.
BENSON: What you got?

404
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,477
Ryan's toolbox.

405
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:35,174
Find anything inside?
Tools.

406
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:38,649
Good. Well,
I've got coffee cups,

407
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:41,888
candy wrappers,
half-eaten sandwich.

408
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:43,322
They should
really think about

409
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:45,291
cleaning this place out
once every two years.

410
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,225
OIivia.
What?

411
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:49,222
Panty hose.

412
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,823
That's not something
you install a Iock with.

413
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:54,596
Neither are these.

414
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:04,007
CLERK: "Number 423154:
People v, Daniel Ryan,

415
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,013
"Two counts Rape
in the First Degree.

416
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:07,878
"One count Attempted Murder
in the Second Degree.

417
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,974
"Two counts Grand Larceny"'

418
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,547
The defendant's plea,
Miss Emerson?

419
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:13,918
Not guilty.

420
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:16,583
I'II take that to mean
on all charges.

421
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:18,592
What can I do
for the People today?

422
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,389
Given the violent nature
of the crimes,

423
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:23,260
we request the defendant
be remanded without bail.

424
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:25,128
JUDGE: This isn't
a murder case, Miss Cabot.

425
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,566
One of the victims
may not walk or talk
normally again

426
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,661
because of the beating
she took from Mr. Ryan.

427
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:31,706
My client has no previous
criminal history, Judge.

428
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,434
He's not a flight risk.

429
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,941
CABOT: Mr. Ryan
installed the Iocks

430
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,307
on both of the homes
of the victims

431
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:37,709
and made duplicate keys.

432
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,610
There could be
more keys out there
that we don't know about.

433
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,615
He is a risk on the street.

434
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:44,618
It's his first offense
so I'm not going to remand,

435
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:45,914
but I agree with you.

436
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:49,514
Bail is set at $500,000,
cash only.

437
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:52,219
Ten minute break
until the next case.

438
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,722
Half a million?
I can barely make my tuition.

439
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:57,390
Don't worry, I'II have
you out by tomorrow.

440
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,260
That's optimistic.

441
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:01,825
Your detectives
blew their search.

442
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:03,666
Not Iikely.
They had permission.

443
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,603
From the wrong person.

444
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,807
So he bought the tools
and toolbox himself.

445
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:15,941
I don't see the problem.

446
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:17,746
People v, Cacioppo,
Your Honor.

447
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,548
Mr. Ryan Iacks the standing
to make the motion

448
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:20,713
because he Ieft
his belongings

449
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,347
in a vehicle
belonging to
someone else.

450
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:24,619
With whom he had
a business relationship.

451
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:25,717
People v, Laws,

452
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:27,227
My client's work ID badge

453
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:28,728
was clipped
to the toolbox handle,

454
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:30,094
and the police
should have checked

455
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,190
whether the toolbox
belonged to him.

456
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,292
Sounds Iike the police
acted in good faith.

457
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:37,099
Your Honor,
if I get permission
from the owner of a company

458
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:38,298
to search an employee's
office,

459
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:39,897
I still can't
open up a Iocked desk

460
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:41,670
even if that desk
is company property.

461
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:44,507
A vehicle is different.
People v, Keegan,

462
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,672
Put your personal property
in someone else's car

463
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,045
without a precaution
to safeguard it,

464
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:50,914
there is no reasonable
expectation of privacy.

465
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:52,112
Miss Emerson,

466
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:55,486
if your client had put
a $5 Iock on his toolbox,

467
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:56,649
we'd be out of here.

468
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:58,556
There were no exigent
circumstances.

469
00:20:58,627 --> 00:20:59,753
What would
have been the harm

470
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:01,125
if the police had come
to Your Honor

471
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:02,424
and asked
for a search warrant

472
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:05,796
before they opened
Mr. Ryan's personal property?

473
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:06,834
Miss Cabot?

474
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,994
We had ample probable cause
for a warrant.

475
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,402
Which I never had
the chance to scrutinize.

476
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:12,599
Your Honor...

477
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:14,972
I'm going to err
on the side of caution.

478
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:17,773
The evidence inside
the toolbox is out.

479
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,948
Why didn't anyone call me?

480
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:23,007
To tell you that
we had permission
to search the van?

481
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:24,346
Would you have stopped us?

482
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,250
CRAGEN: Let's stop
throwing blame around.

483
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,414
We got screwed
by Iegal maneuvering.

484
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,821
We still have
Ryan's fingerprints

485
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:31,290
and his DNA is not back yet.

486
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,657
Anyone besides me
got a problem
with any of this?

487
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:34,820
CRAGEN: What are you saying?

488
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:38,388
Well, those Iocksmith vans
run 24 hours a day.

489
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:42,027
Why would Ryan put
$135,000 worth of jewelry

490
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:44,435
in a place he knew
someone else could
find it?

491
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:46,133
'Cause it wasn't Ryan.

492
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:47,665
DNA?

493
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:49,733
FIN: Report's back.
It's not his.

494
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,278
He didn't rape Jessica Todd,

495
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:53,177
Denise Johansen
or anybody else.

496
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:56,081
Which means someone went to
a hell of a Iot of trouble
to set him up.

497
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:59,985
Maybe whoever planted
the evidence Ieft prints
on Ryan's toolbox.

498
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:01,579
AIong with the other two men
who drive the truck

499
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:03,783
and God knows who else.
Same problem.

500
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,325
Well, I think
it's worth a shot.

501
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:06,951
How fast can you
spring Ryan?

502
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,790
I can have him in court
by tomorrow morning.

503
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:12,389
Toolbox is
still in our custody
at the property clerk.

504
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:16,403
We need the Iab to dust it
and everything inside
for prints.

505
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:19,031
Be sure you get Ryan's
permission this time.

506
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:20,639
No way.

507
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,836
I wouldn't even be in here
if it weren't for you people.

508
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,209
We're gonna have you
out of here within the hour.

509
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,474
I don't believe you.

510
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:27,879
Look, man,
somebody set you up.

511
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,110
We busted you, which means
we got set up, too.

512
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:31,880
Don't you
want to find out
who did this to you?

513
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:33,250
FIN:
Anybody got a beef with you?

514
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:34,948
Work, friends, family?

515
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:36,388
No.

516
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,857
I mind my own business.

517
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:40,019
Anybody at work
talk about Ieaving,

518
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:42,996
going on to something else,
maybe coming into some money?

519
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:44,622
Most of the guys are Iifers.

520
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:46,893
Only one talking
about getting out is me.

521
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:50,500
I give you permission
for the toolbox,

522
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:52,233
you'II find out
who wanted me in here?

523
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:54,241
It may be the only way.

524
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:59,673
We found dozens of prints,
inside and out.

525
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:00,840
The ones that
aren't Ryan's match

526
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:03,247
seven other
bonded employees
of Parks Safe and Security.

527
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:06,151
The judge is never gonna give
us warrants for all their DNA.

528
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:09,156
You may not need it.
Let me show you something.

529
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:11,286
STABLER:
Where's the partial from?

530
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,224
One of the diamonds
on Denise Johansen's
bracelet.

531
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:16,388
You found a surface
big enough to hold
a print?

532
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:17,795
Those are two-carat diamonds,

533
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:19,390
not enough surface
for a 10-point print,

534
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:21,059
but I put the partial
into the computer,

535
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:22,865
it spit out
a six-point match.

536
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:27,465
Ed Todd's prints are on
Denise Johansen's bracelet.

537
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,272
There's no way
Ed could've handled it
unless he knows the perp.

538
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:32,006
Son of a bitch
must've hired someone

539
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,980
to rape Denise
and his own wife.

540
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:36,881
But a hired gun isn't
gonna be careless enough
to Ieave his DNA behind

541
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,316
unless it's window dressing.

542
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:41,549
Well, Iet's say
this hired gun rapes
Denise then Jessica.

543
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,151
Now, he doesn't hit Denise,
but he beats Jessica
nearly to death.

544
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,853
I mean, come on,
Ed Todd wants his wife dead.

545
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,020
But not Denise,

546
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:49,620
she doesn't have a scratch,
which means

547
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,187
Denise has to be in on it.

548
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:53,928
FIN: And the two of them
set up the Iocksmith
as fall guy.

549
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:55,936
Attractive woman
in her 30s Iike Denise

550
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:58,131
marries a 67-year-old CEO,

551
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:00,470
it's gotta be for his money.
Why hook up with Todd?

552
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,943
Well, Denise figures
that she and Todd,
they kill Jessica,

553
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:05,946
she's gonna get rich
a hell of a Iot faster

554
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:07,845
than waiting for
Curtis Johansen to die.

555
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,408
And Todd probably thinks
he wiped that bracelet clean.

556
00:24:11,486 --> 00:24:13,113
Let's test him.

557
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:16,490
It's not the Iocksmith?

558
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,349
His DNA wasn't a match.

559
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:20,291
He's still out there.

560
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,192
Well, couldn't it
be somebody else

561
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:23,662
from the Iocksmith company?

562
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:26,063
Yeah,
we're checking into that.

563
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:29,066
Do you remember touching
Ryan's toolbox?

564
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:31,327
(COUGHING)

565
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:34,397
Here, sweetie.

566
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:36,439
The Iocksmith took
a bathroom break,

567
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:37,842
and I borrowed
his screwdriver

568
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:40,437
to tighten one of
the kitchen cabinet doors.

569
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:42,483
Aside from the bathroom
and the entry foyer,

570
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,848
was Ryan in any other
part of your house?

571
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,386
No. Not that I remember.

572
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:48,752
Why are you asking
these questions?

573
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:51,485
Because they have to, honey.
That's their job.

574
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,994
I am so sorry, but she had
a rough morning in rehab.

575
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:59,158
We won't take up
any more of your time.

576
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,934
Sorry to bother you.

577
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:07,072
Now, did I see Todd blink
when I asked him about
that toolbox?

578
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:09,166
Spooked him enough
to make him admit
that he touched it.

579
00:25:09,244 --> 00:25:11,474
And now he's saying Ryan
went to the bathroom.

580
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:14,037
This guy
is telling so many Iies,
he can't keep them straight.

581
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,605
I wonder which one
he told Jessica

582
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:17,412
to get his hands
on her fortune.

583
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,883
Let's check out
the source of the money.

584
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,720
Jerry's estate was worth
about 10 million.

585
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:29,228
He Ieft every cent
to Jessica.

586
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:30,525
She was the Iove
of his Iife.

587
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:32,065
She still have it?

588
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,499
AII but 2.5 million.

589
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,864
We just sold off
some stock for her.

590
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:40,601
With the market
as Iow as it is now,
she must have taken a bath.

591
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:42,666
Believe me, I tried
to talk her out of it.

592
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:44,609
Especially when she said
that she was investing

593
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:45,941
in her husband's
new restaurant.

594
00:25:46,014 --> 00:25:50,007
Yeah, now,
is it such a bad risk
with someone Iike Ed Todd?

595
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:51,608
I mean,
he does have experience.

596
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:52,983
Had a Iot of experience.

597
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:54,749
Todd came to us
about two years ago

598
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:57,723
Iooking to sell
his restaurant group
in Washington State.

599
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,521
Jerry handled the deal.

600
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,653
Todd said that
Mr. BIaine made him
quite a bit of money.

601
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:04,061
After our cut,
about $35 million.

602
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,999
I'm surprised
that he would want to
get back into the business.

603
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,263
Especially here.

604
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:10,463
Why is that?

605
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:13,803
The city's economy
after September 11,

606
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,740
you would have to
have Emeril himself

607
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,210
running the place
in order to break even.

608
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,338
And besides,
a guy Todd's age,

609
00:26:20,415 --> 00:26:23,907
with his money,
he should spend
his days playing golf.

610
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,955
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

611
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:32,415
What's up?

612
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:34,222
We just spoke to Ed Todd.

613
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:35,990
The real Edwin Todd.

614
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,123
AIive and well?

615
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,532
STABLER:
Seventy-two years young,
enjoying his retirement

616
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,093
in his mansion
on Puget Sound

617
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:44,570
just outside Seattle.

618
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,834
Hasn't been to New York
since the mid-'80s.

619
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:48,933
And he isn't married
to Jessica.

620
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,749
I just talked to CSU.

621
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,384
They say somebody SIim-Jimmed
open the driver's side door
of Ryan's van.

622
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,823
Checking for prints now.

623
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,258
That's not gonna help us
with the phony Edwin Todd.

624
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,761
Ran that partial
from the bracelet,

625
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,730
both State and Federal,
no hits.

626
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,663
Todd has two bank accounts.

627
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:15,828
One personal,
one for his company,
Culinary Equities.

628
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:18,565
Combined balances,
148,000 and change.

629
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,665
Well,
that doesn't sound Iike
enough to open a coffee shop,

630
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:22,209
Iet alone
a high-end restaurant.

631
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:25,177
Well, he had more,
but not much more.

632
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,441
Todd paid first
and Iast months' rent,

633
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,244
plus two months'
security for the space.

634
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:30,807
Total, 40,000.

635
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:33,649
AIso wrote another
160,000 in checks

636
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:36,622
to vendors, food,
restaurant equipment,
furniture.

637
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:38,921
Problem is,
we've been trying
to call these vendors.

638
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:40,153
We can't find them.

639
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:41,627
And Jessica Todd's account?

640
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,132
She deposited the 2.5 million
from her stock sale Iast week.

641
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:48,566
Then put a check
for $200,000 to
Culinary Equities.

642
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:50,570
Explains why fake Todd
hasn't taken off.

643
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:52,037
He doesn't have
all the money in.

644
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:55,701
Is there any
solid connection between
him and Denise Johansen?

645
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:58,405
Well, Todd made
cell phone calls to
an apartment in the Village.

646
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:01,539
The same Village number
was dialed regularly
from a pay phone

647
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:04,585
right down the block from
where the Johansen's Iive.

648
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:07,746
Fin and I will
check out the apartment.
You two pay Mrs. Todd a visit.

649
00:28:07,822 --> 00:28:10,655
I think it's time
she got a reality check.

650
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,962
JESSICA: Well,
Edwin's been wonderful.

651
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:20,123
He's spent
almost all his time
here since this happened.

652
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,395
(CLEARING THROAT)

653
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:24,905
I don't know
how he's going to open
his restaurant on schedule.

654
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:26,530
And how much money have
you given your husband

655
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:27,938
so far for the restaurant?

656
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,567
$200,000.

657
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:31,669
Did he say when he needs
the rest of the money?

658
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:33,907
Next week.
What are you getting at?

659
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:36,674
Mrs. Todd,
we believe your husband

660
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,844
has been planning
for some time now

661
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:42,121
(SIGHING)
to steal your money.

662
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:45,216
We checked his bank accounts.

663
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,327
The money you gave him
is gone.

664
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:51,430
Well, of course it is.
He had to pay his vendors.

665
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:53,990
Those checks were written
to dummy companies.

666
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,729
They don't exist.

667
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,906
I don't believe you.

668
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:08,440
Does your husband have access
to any more of your money?

669
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:12,976
When I die, he's the sole
beneficiary of my will.

670
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,382
STABLER:
When did you sign that will?

671
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:16,684
Two weeks ago.

672
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,750
BENSON:
Before you were attacked.

673
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:22,996
Was it your husband's idea?
No.

674
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:24,922
It was mine.

675
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,767
So, you see,
you're wrong about Edwin.

676
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:32,772
How much will he get?

677
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:35,335
Everything.
My entire estate.

678
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:41,110
Mrs. Todd, your husband
sent someone to kill you
for your money.

679
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:46,819
How can that be?

680
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:52,352
I can't take care of myself.

681
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:57,022
Edwin's waiting on me
hand and foot.

682
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:03,660
He's changed my diaper.

683
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:10,099
He wouldn't do that
if he didn't Iove me.

684
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:17,911
CRAGEN: You recognize them?

685
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,215
Sure, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, 3B.

686
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:22,153
Seen the Browns
around Iately?

687
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:23,815
Nope, but that doesn't
mean anything.

688
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,017
They keep weird hours.

689
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:26,855
Salespeople, you know,
always on the road.

690
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:28,225
Yeah. Thank you.

691
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,720
So what's the plan, Captain?

692
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:32,288
Call CSU for a search team.

693
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,630
Make sure they send
a print tech
and the Photo Unit.

694
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:37,262
I'II get Cabot
started on a warrant.

695
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,398
Nothing in here.

696
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:42,673
Anything in the bedroom?

697
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:44,540
The closet and the dresser
are both empty.

698
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:47,012
Some Iadies' thongs
in the bed sheets.

699
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:52,714
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What you got?

700
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:55,551
Looks Iike the Browns
forgot something.

701
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:58,183
Canada West boarding pass
to Winnipeg,

702
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,083
name of Edwin Todd.

703
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:01,355
Dated Iast week.

704
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:03,021
That's just before
Jessica was attacked.

705
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:04,860
Let's call the Winnipeg
police.

706
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:08,424
See if they can
help us find out
what Todd was doing there.

707
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:10,801
Talked to the airlines.

708
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:13,670
Todd, or whatever his name is,
took three trips to Winnipeg

709
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:15,299
in the two weeks
before Jessica
was attacked.

710
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:16,707
If he had a record
in Canada,

711
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:19,143
explains why
we couldn't get
a hit on his prints.

712
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:21,443
Call CSU,
have them overnight

713
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:23,142
all the prints we found
in the apartment

714
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,082
to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.

715
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:26,676
Hey, we might get Iucky.

716
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,221
We still got a problem
with the DNA.

717
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,517
It's not Ryan or Todd's.

718
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,023
If Denise faked
being attacked,

719
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:32,559
how did she have
the DNA in her

720
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:34,219
that showed up
on the rape kit?

721
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:37,626
By having sex
with her husband.

722
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,500
STABLER: She takes
the rest of his semen,

723
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,729
plants it on Jessica,

724
00:31:42,803 --> 00:31:45,033
makes it Iook Iike
the same guy raped them both.

725
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:48,198
Talk to Curtis Johansen.

726
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:51,468
You want me to
take a DNA test?

727
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:53,410
I feel Iike I should
be calling my attorney.

728
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:55,574
You're not a suspect,
Mr. Johansen.

729
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,379
In fact,
you might be a victim.

730
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:01,418
I think you better tell me
what's going on here.

731
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:02,922
Okay, before you Ieft
for your trip,

732
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,719
were you and your wife
intimate?

733
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,559
Sex is not Iacking
in our marriage,
Detective.

734
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:09,152
Is this necessary?

735
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,130
I'm afraid it is, yes.

736
00:32:13,935 --> 00:32:15,493
That afternoon.

737
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:19,066
Denise called me
and told me

738
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,631
she had a romantic
send-off planned,

739
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,973
that I should come home early.

740
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:26,703
When I got to the house,
we made Iove.

741
00:32:27,848 --> 00:32:30,009
What does any of this have
to do with her being raped?

742
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:33,542
Your wife reported the rape
right after you Ieft,
Mr. Johansen.

743
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,748
We think that she faked it.

744
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:39,051
Why in the hell
would she do that?

745
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:40,354
To cover up a crime.

746
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,293
She planted your semen
on the other victim

747
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:44,331
after almost
beating her to death.

748
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,431
I don't believe any of this.
What proof do you have?

749
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:51,266
STABLER: Well, your DNA test
will tell us for sure.

750
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,204
She knew that
we wouldn't Iook
at you as a suspect

751
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:54,935
because
you were out of town.

752
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:58,235
My God.

753
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:00,509
She set me up? Why?

754
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,677
She's hooked up with a man
who calls himself Ed Todd.

755
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:04,809
The restaurateur?

756
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:05,874
Yes, do you know him?

757
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:10,117
Do I know him?
I've committed $250,000
to his restaurant project.

758
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:12,887
Denise's idea.

759
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,951
That's their game,
Mr. Johansen.

760
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,224
They want to steal your money.

761
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:20,461
I don't go into
a business venture
half-cocked.

762
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:21,694
I've seen the Iocation.

763
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,259
I've been over
the business plan,

764
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:24,964
met most of the other
investors,

765
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,098
including Todd's wife.

766
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,074
The other rape victim.

767
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,141
STABLER: Labs are back.

768
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:35,546
BENSON: It's Curtis Johansen's
DNA in both women.

769
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,882
So Jessica was signing
her own death sentence

770
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:42,582
when she made out that will
Ieaving everything to Todd.

771
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,318
We gotta pick him and Denise
up before they carry it out.

772
00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:46,417
You know that's a problem.

773
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:48,621
That partial print proves
this is Todd all the way.

774
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:49,788
Proves it to us.

775
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:51,263
It's only
six points of similarity.

776
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:52,458
It's useless in court.

777
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:55,195
Well, this won't be.
RCMP came through.

778
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:58,670
Todd's real name
is Edward Crandall,
formerly of Toronto.

779
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:01,435
Did three years in Kingston
Penitentiary for fraud.

780
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:02,601
What about Denise?

781
00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:05,543
CRAGEN:
Real name is Denise Cormier,

782
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:07,638
born in Quebec,
arrested with Crandall

783
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,910
and did her time
in Maplehurst.

784
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:12,282
Where do Jessica and Curtis
stand on cooperating?

785
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:15,288
Johansen is on board.
Jessica won't believe it.

786
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:18,223
Well, we're gonna
have to change her mind.

787
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:21,327
JESSICA: What's this?

788
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,294
What are you showing me?

789
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:26,993
Your husband.
He has a prison record
in Canada for fraud.

790
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,203
You're trying to trick me.

791
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:31,533
Sorry, Mrs. Todd,

792
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,171
but it's the truth.

793
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,572
This woman

794
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:38,301
is his partner.

795
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:42,708
We think she attacked you,
staged your rape and her own.

796
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,384
Take me back to the hospital.

797
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:46,586
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

798
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:48,781
You should see these first.

799
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:51,418
What's this place?

800
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:54,960
They share an apartment
together in the Village.

801
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:56,997
Both of their prints
were found there.

802
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:06,598
Edwin's been so good for me.

803
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,500
I trusted him.

804
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:15,671
I never thought
I'd get married again,
and then Edwin came along.

805
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:19,749
Then a few months
after Jerry died,

806
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,050
Edwin called,
said he was in town,

807
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,888
asked if he might
take me out to dinner.

808
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:30,419
Well, he said
all the right things.

809
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:36,068
Told me I was beautiful,

810
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:39,235
Jerry was a Iucky man.

811
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:43,841
He said

812
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,504
he knew he could
never take Jerry's place.

813
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:53,709
Oh, but I'd already begun
to fall in Iove with him.

814
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:56,990
And when he asked me
to marry him,

815
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:00,055
I said yes.

816
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:02,523
Mrs. Todd,

817
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,454
if you help us,

818
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:06,500
we will make him
pay for this.

819
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,732
I can't.

820
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:13,562
Why not?

821
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:18,506
Edwin confessed to me
Iast night.

822
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:23,445
He told me everything,
the whole scheme.

823
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:28,213
He asked me to forgive him,

824
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:32,089
and I did.

825
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:38,754
Edwin and his partner
put you in that wheelchair.

826
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,595
JESSICA: He never
meant for this to happen.

827
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:45,332
He admitted he had had
an affair with that woman,

828
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:48,964
but he said it was over.

829
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:51,804
He said she beat me
out of jealousy.

830
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:55,177
Mrs. Todd,
they're in this together.

831
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:58,650
This is not about jealousy.
This is not about Iove.

832
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,586
This is about
stealing your money.

833
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:02,747
And if you don't help us,

834
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:04,654
they're gonna
get away with it.

835
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,388
Edwin's Iawyer called me
this morning.

836
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:17,060
He said I could never testify
about what Edwin had told me

837
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:20,329
because I'm his wife.

838
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,705
I feel so stupid.

839
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:34,746
BENSON: Curtis Johansen
got the same phone call from
Denise's attorney this morning

840
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,551
after she confessed
to him Iast night.

841
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:39,149
Protected themselves
by marrying their victims.

842
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,523
These two are real pieces
of work.

843
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,391
Tied our hands
and our victims'.

844
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:45,193
CABOT: And we can't
prove any of it
beyond a reasonable doubt.

845
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:47,666
What about Curtis Johansen's
DNA?

846
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:49,066
Put that to a jury,
and they'II think

847
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:50,763
Johansen raped
Jessica and Denise

848
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,135
even though he has an alibi.

849
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:53,798
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come in.

850
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:57,173
We have battered wives
testify against the husbands
who beat them all the time.

851
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,370
How is this different?

852
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:01,141
Those women testified about
what their husbands did,

853
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:02,546
not what they said.

854
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:05,210
Those wives
still cannot reveal
confidential communication

855
00:38:05,286 --> 00:38:07,345
between themselves
and their husbands.

856
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:10,049
Well, there's got to be
a Ioophole for a situation
Iike this.

857
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:13,457
I checked the case Iaw.
There has never been
a situation Iike this.

858
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:18,724
What is it?
Marriage Iicenses.

859
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,830
Edwin Todd
to Jessica BIaine.

860
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:25,227
Curtis Johansen
to Denise Carlson.

861
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:28,999
Thought her name was Cormier.

862
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,476
Pick up Todd and Denise.
For what?

863
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:37,745
False names
on their marriage Iicenses.
They finally made a mistake.

864
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:42,052
Are you kidding me
with this charge?

865
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:43,919
Don't you worry. We got
better ones on the way.

866
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:46,357
I don't see how.

867
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:48,952
You really think
you can get away with this?

868
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,521
You don't have to use that
tone with me, Detective.

869
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:56,600
STABLER: Your real name
is Denise Cormier.

870
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,796
So what?

871
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:00,102
Well, on the certificate
of marriage,

872
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:02,165
it says Denise Carlson.

873
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:04,369
Where are you going
with this?

874
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:07,608
Your client Iied
about her name.

875
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,209
And because you Iied,

876
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:14,717
your marriage to
Jessica BIaine is void.

877
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:19,555
PIease, how many times do
I have to tell you about
your tone of voice?

878
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:21,287
Oh, I'm sorry.

879
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:25,389
If my manners bother you,
Iet me use your real name
for this.

880
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:30,096
Edward Crandall,
you're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit murder,

881
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,833
attempted murder,
robbery and grand Iarceny.

882
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:37,604
If you're going
to use his real name,
you better use Edwin Todd.

883
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:39,043
Excuse me?

884
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:52,453
What's this?
Mrs. Johansen's
Iegal name change

885
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:56,895
to Denise Carlson before
she married Curtis Johansen.

886
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:58,964
It's Canadian.

887
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:00,829
How do I know
it's not a forgery?

888
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:04,469
Because that's a copy
we ordered from

889
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,903
the Registrar of Records
in Winnipeg,

890
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:07,838
where the original is on file.

891
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:09,432
Note the seal at the bottom.

892
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:14,875
So why'd you change
your name, Edwin?

893
00:40:16,116 --> 00:40:17,310
Don't answer that.

894
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:18,908
Oh, come on,
what's the harm?

895
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:21,978
Sorry.
I'm gonna have to go
with my Iawyer on that one.

896
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,425
How we doing?
FIN: We found the money,

897
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:30,622
courtesy of our friends
at the RCMP.

898
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:32,892
Five accounts
in Winnipeg Crown Bank

899
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:35,764
under the names
of the vendors that
Todd wrote the checks to.

900
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,736
He's the signatory
on all the accounts.

901
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:40,330
Waited for
the checks to clear,
then made cash withdrawals,

902
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:42,637
Ieaving each account
with $1,000.

903
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:45,542
So he gets the money
out of the country,
then converts it to cash

904
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,637
so we can't trace it
any further.

905
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:49,909
This guy is good.
Now what about Denise?

906
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:53,714
Well, I can't find
any accounts in her names,
but the RCMP is still Iooking.

907
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,846
I put a uniform detail
on Jessica,

908
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:57,015
just to be on the safe side.

909
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,058
AIso got one
on Todd and Denise

910
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,559
in case they decide
to cut their Iosses

911
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:01,889
and run back to Canada.

912
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,259
What the hell's this mean?

913
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,161
STABLER: What do you got?
It's a credit card
statement

914
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:06,790
in the name
of Edward Crandall.

915
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:09,335
Some hotel in Acapulco
a year and a half ago.

916
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:10,529
It's in Spanish.

917
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:13,437
Well, resorts are a great
place to pick up a mark.

918
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,165
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

919
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,479
"Luna de miel"
means "honeymoon"'

920
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,609
Son of a bitch.

921
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,373
Why would Ed and Denise
be staying

922
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,418
in the honeymoon suite
of that hotel?

923
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:30,451
We're not going to allow
the continued harassment
of our clients.

924
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:32,389
Why are we here?

925
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,983
The honeymoon's over.

926
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:35,852
What does that mean?

927
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:40,767
It's in Spanish.
You want to clue us in?

928
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:44,326
Yeah, it's your clients'
Mexican marriage Iicense.

929
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:48,435
I told you we should
have gotten a divorce.

930
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,500
Shut up, you stupid bitch.

931
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:54,206
You see,
this is the Iast time
I'm gonna take care of you.

932
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:56,781
It was all his idea.

933
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,784
And they can't
prove any of it

934
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,649
if you keep
your trap shut.

935
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:02,612
What's the matter,
Counselors,

936
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:05,522
you didn't know
they were married
to each other?

937
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:07,287
CABOT: Unless you can produce
divorce papers

938
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:08,919
preceding your clients'
respective weddings

939
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:11,123
to Jessica BIaine
and Curtis Johansen,

940
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:13,257
it's as if those marriages
never existed.

941
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,527
No. Jessica needs me.

942
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:15,898
You see,
I do everything for her.

943
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:18,267
She's not going to
testify against me.

944
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:27,712
Mrs. BIaine.

945
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:30,041
No.

946
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,114
Her Iast name is Todd.

947
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:35,814
Now you know my wife is ill.

948
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:38,490
You have no right
to bring her here.

949
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,022
Hi, sweetie,
you should be resting.

950
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:47,330
Sit down, you bastard.

951
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,468
You know what?
This was all a mistake.

952
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:56,635
Yes, I stole your money.
She was only supposed
to take your watch.

953
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,235
You weren't supposed to
get hurt.

954
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:03,811
You're upset.

955
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:08,185
We need to get away,
just you and me, huh?

956
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,382
Anywhere you want to go.

957
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:15,389
The only place
you're going is to hell.
