NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:03,999
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:05,199
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:08,175
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:11,771
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,543
These are their stories,

7
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,476
FRANK: I'II get a cab.

8
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:21,256
How's it going?
Is it a Iove connection?

9
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:22,723
I don't think he Iikes me.

10
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:27,422
That's crazy. You're adorable.
Definitely Steve's type.
Talk to him.

11
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:32,225
Sorry. I didn't mean...
It's fine. It's all right.

12
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm just really nervous.

13
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:40,631
Me, too.
I think we both need to relax.
I know this great piano bar.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,371
(GUN FIRING)

15
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:44,743
Get out of here. I'II call.

16
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:50,218
Hold it!
Let me see your hands!

17
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,579
Now!
Okay.

18
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:59,051
My name's Phil.

19
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:01,687
I sleep here.

20
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,906
Detective Nathan?
Steve.

21
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:13,203
OIivia, this is EIIiot.

22
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:15,870
Your John Doe's a white male,
early mid-20s.

23
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,503
Caught a slug in the gut.

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,946
Crime scene's an alley
off of a bar called Puffy's.

25
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:22,246
I'm not sure, but I think
I saw the victim inside.

26
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:23,580
Inside the bar?

27
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:27,384
I was on a date.
Set up by friends.
Made a great first impression.

28
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:28,924
Do we suspect a gay bashing?

29
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:31,960
Can't say for sure.
Victim was gang-raped.
That's why I called you.

30
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:33,325
Doctors found copious fluids.

31
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:34,420
Witness?

32
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:36,158
Name's Phil Kastner.

33
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:38,393
Brick chip caught him
in the cheek
from the ricochet.

34
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,959
CIaims he just got there
wanting to bed down.

35
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,470
STABLER: What,
you don't believe him?

36
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:46,338
Sounds good, but he's pretty
clean for a street sleeper.

37
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,173
Uniforms took him for a meal
but I'II make sure
he gets to the squad.

38
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,234
Okay. Thanks for your help.

39
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,372
You need anything else,
you can reach me at the 25.

40
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,814
Okay. You know, Steve,
if you want
a Iittle discretion on this,

41
00:01:54,884 --> 00:01:56,112
we can try
and keep you out of it.

42
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:58,483
I don't broadcast,
but the brass already knows.

43
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:01,148
Thanks for asking, though.
Okay. Take it easy.

44
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,692
BENSON: I'II need
to see the wound, please.

45
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:08,155
It's an old scar.
Doubt he uses that hand much.

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,227
Okay. No other wounds,
no tattoos.
So, just this scar?

47
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,800
Yeah.
And a wedding ring.

48
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:18,431
Well, if he was
in a committed relationship,

49
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:20,567
we might be able to get a hit
off Missing Persons.

50
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:25,376
He's in a meat market bar.
Let's hope his partner's
more committed than he is.

51
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,891
Thanks for the shower
and the clothes.

52
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:22,665
I do Iaundry on Thursdays,
so I'II wash these
and I'II bring them back.

53
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:24,103
STABLER: Yours to keep.

54
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:27,074
No, no, no, no.
I appreciate that
but I've got plenty.

55
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:29,907
I'II give them to somebody
who needs them.

56
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,742
You a junkie, Phil?

57
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:35,341
Sugar gave me away, huh?

58
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:36,715
How Iong you been clean?

59
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:38,253
Sixty-four days,

60
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:42,621
five hours, twelve minutes,
six seconds.

61
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:45,160
Seven, eight, nine...

62
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:49,798
Sebastian, he's my counselor.
He gave me the watch.

63
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:52,891
Said I needed to tell time
to know how precious it is.

64
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,460
It's precious agony.
Yeah.

65
00:03:57,306 --> 00:04:00,366
Okay, the alley outside
of Puffy's, is that
where you usually rest?

66
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:04,436
Yeah. The gays, they treat
me human, so I stay there
when I can't find a bed.

67
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:06,276
Where do you usually stay?

68
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,284
Mission on 10th
when I'm not in rehab.

69
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:12,083
You see the shooter, Phil?

70
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:15,715
It was dark, but I got
a good Iook at him
when he broke the alley.

71
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:20,285
Brown hair,
between 5'10" and 6 feet.
I didn't see his eyes, though.

72
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:22,160
You see the gun?

73
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:24,922
Snub-nose revolver.
Probably a.38.

74
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:32,435
I was a master sergeant,
Parris Island.

75
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,771
It was a Iifetime ago.

76
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:36,971
You know, Phil,
veterans are eligible

77
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:39,173
for Uncle Sam benefits.
You know that, right?

78
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:40,772
Not without an address.

79
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,217
The waiting Iist for housing,
oh, it's awfully Iong.

80
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:48,724
How much of this addict's
statement can we believe?

81
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,986
I'd say all of it. He was
Iucid enough for details.

82
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,019
If we find our shooter,
Phil's testimony won't hold up
in court without help.

83
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:57,395
It's putting the proverbial
cart, don't you think?

84
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,297
Get him to agree
to a blood test.

85
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:02,599
If his tox screen
shows he's clean now,
the Iawyers can't argue Iater.

86
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:04,367
Good thing you know
the drug business.

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,601
GIad I could bring
something to the table.

88
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:08,075
I didn't mean that.
Forget it.

89
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:11,238
Look, get on it before
we Iose Phil to the street.

90
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,407
What's with him?
What's the word
on our John Doe,

91
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:15,040
and what the hell was he doing
in that alley?

92
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:18,951
No solicitation, hits.
Vice couldn't ID him
from the photo or the prints,

93
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:20,215
so he's not a known pro.

94
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:23,224
Doctors found three different
blood types in the semen.

95
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,021
This Iooks Iike
a rape gang-bang.

96
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:26,561
Good money's on a hate crime.

97
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,325
Perps are usually hetero,
or closeted and in denial.

98
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:33,801
Well, there was a ring
on his finger. So, maybe
he's cheating, wanted out.

99
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,734
Picked up the wrong guys
in the meat market.

100
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,136
John, you're on missing
persons.

101
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:42,200
While you two canvass
that bar, see if our John Doe
introduced himself around.

102
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,439
Looked a hell of a Iot better
than that Iast night.

103
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:47,311
Did you catch a name?
No. I'm not his type.

104
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,318
Pretty boys tend to
stick together.
Did you see someone with him?

105
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,549
Yeah, one of our regulars,
but he's not into
working guys over.

106
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:56,216
Well, we'II still
need to talk to him.
This regular have a name?

107
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:59,693
Being gay doesn't mean
being violent.
Whoever did that was straight.

108
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:03,698
As a matter of fact,
gay bashers
Iook a Iot Iike you.

109
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:07,133
Look, we really don't want
a hassle, but this is how
it's gonna play out.

110
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:09,694
We come back here
with a warrant,
we go through your receipts,

111
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:12,707
and while we're doing that,
we close down your bar.

112
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:16,267
Name's Willem. I know him.
He didn't do this.

113
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:19,712
They had a drink at the bar.
Will passed him
a thick envelope.

114
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:21,010
Did you see
what was in the envelope?

115
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,813
No, and I didn't overhear
any conversation, either.

116
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:25,513
Music here gets pretty Ioud.

117
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:26,577
Did they Ieave together?

118
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:27,849
Your guy Ieft alone.

119
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:29,686
Hard to believe,
with a body Iike that.

120
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,124
STABLER:
What about this Willem?

121
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,717
Left at Iast call.

122
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,389
Okay. We'II need to
hear that from him, so,
do you have an address?

123
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:39,560
No, but you can find one
from the credit card receipts.

124
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,471
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

125
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:48,669
Yes?

126
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,006
You Willem Mueller?

127
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,311
No. Ray Borland.
Willem's my houseboy.
What's he done this time?

128
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:56,613
We just need to talk to him.
Is he in?

129
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:58,516
He's picking up my Iaundry.
What's this about?

130
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,613
Have you ever seen this man
with Mr. Mueller?

131
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,887
No, I haven't. I'm pretty
sure he'II be back soon.

132
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:08,862
Okay. Have him give us a call
when he comes in.

133
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,831
Thank you, Mr. Borland.

134
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:15,068
Houseboy?

135
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:18,774
Guess that's what
they're called these days.

136
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,674
He fits the witness
description.

137
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:26,338
Willem Mueller? We'd Iike to
talk to you about Iast night.

138
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:32,754
Seven years in Sing Sing.
Possession with Intent
and assault two.

139
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,619
I've changed my evil ways.

140
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,817
Not in this Iifetime.
Recognize him?

141
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:38,519
Had a couple drinks. So what?

142
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:41,324
He was found worked over
in that alley
in more ways than one,

143
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,627
and you were the Iast person
seen with him.

144
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,894
I didn't touch him.
Not even for fun.

145
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:47,162
What's his name?

146
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:48,965
Peter Ivanhoe.

147
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,199
That for real?
It's what he said.

148
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,298
What was the envelope for?

149
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:55,173
I was paying for a job.

150
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:57,269
What was he running for you,
coke or crystal meth?

151
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,177
Not that kind of job.
I'm out of that business.

152
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,943
Well, what, then?

153
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:02,540
I plead the fifth.
He pleads the fifth.

154
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:04,950
You're not on trial.
BENSON: Yet.

155
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,851
Terence Moore,
representing Mr. Mueller,

156
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:08,981
who is done talking
unless you're charging him.

157
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:11,788
He's free to go
after we get his DNA.

158
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,158
You're gonna need a warrant.

159
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,753
Not a problem.
Known violent ex-con

160
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,128
who just happens to be
the Iast person
seen with the victim.

161
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,533
We're just waiting for
the Iab tech, so why don't you
have a seat, Counselor?

162
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:26,764
Have an orange juice.
Natural sugar's
better than a candy bar.

163
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,400
Oh, thanks.

164
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:31,310
We're holding a suspect,
so if it pans out,
we'II do a Iineup.

165
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,938
You know where to find me.

166
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:36,314
You're thinking
about it right now,
just using one more time.

167
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,784
AII day, every day.

168
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,151
And one more time
will kill you, Phil.
You know that, right?

169
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:42,383
Smoker doesn't know
which cigarette
will give him cancer.

170
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,985
Drinker doesn't know which
cocktail will give him
cirrhosis. It's a compulsion.

171
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,894
You gotta stop making excuses.
Take this.

172
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:51,566
We get Mueller's DNA?

173
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:52,828
It's on its way to the Iab.

174
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:55,166
Anything on the victim
from Missing Persons?

175
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,899
National Center for
Missing & Exploited Children
got a hit.

176
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:00,271
In Cedar Creek, Arkansas,
a 17-year-old boy

177
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,333
Wesley Jansen
went missing in 1993.

178
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,936
STABLER: Juvenile records?
No. Part of the kids'
fingerprint program.

179
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,140
You contacted his parents?

180
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:07,307
They're flying in.

181
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:09,783
What's the connection between
the runaway and the ex-con?

182
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:12,616
Well, Mueller played dumb
on the envelope, but he's been
in the drug trade,

183
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:15,919
so it's a dope payoff
or money to make a buy.

184
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:19,825
If he's making bank selling
drugs, then why's he doing
Ray Borland's Iaundry?

185
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,159
I checked with Narcotics.
Borland's a player.

186
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,631
Got caught holding on a couple
of big-time possession beefs.

187
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,928
Bought his way out from under.

188
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:28,561
He was connected. The real
Iaundry is cleaning money.

189
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:31,970
So, Mueller fronts as
Borland's man on the street.

190
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,805
Wesley Jansen, a.k.a.
Peter Ivanhoe,
is either a dealer...

191
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:37,311
Thanks.
...mule or a client.

192
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,679
Hospital just called.
Our victim is awake,
so go ask him nicely.

193
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,779
STABLER: Who's Wesley Jansen?

194
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:50,324
If that's the name
of my roomie, he's gone.

195
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,383
Do you know where he went?
He didn't talk to me.

196
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:53,723
Well, what time did he skip?

197
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,058
About 30 minutes ago.

198
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,065
He Iost it
when the nurse told him
the cops were on the way.

199
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,658
You Iet John Doe just walk
out of here with a gut wound?

200
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,499
He's ambulatory,
but just barely.

201
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:05,802
The dressing
has to be changed. He needs
round-the-clock antibiotics.

202
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:08,434
This guy will be back
with a staph infection.

203
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,637
Did he have any visitors
coming in or out of here?

204
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:13,511
Not a soul. AII he did
was yak on the phone.

205
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:16,380
"I Iove you. Don't worry.
See you soon."

206
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:20,655
Well, the idea
of talking to the cops
spooked him so much

207
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:22,122
that he runs with
a bullet wound in his gut.

208
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:25,490
Someone had to pick him up.
We'II dump his phones
and find out who.

209
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,521
Open up. Police.

210
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:32,091
TV's on. It's a good sign.

211
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:37,930
Oh, God. What?

212
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,338
Wesley Jansen?
Yeah.

213
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:40,966
Can we come in?

214
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,144
Nice place.
Sure beats a hospital room.

215
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:49,047
Yeah. I'm gonna pay
for that bill, I swear.

216
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:51,382
This isn't about the bill.
It's about your assault.

217
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:53,148
Yeah. Okay.

218
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:54,655
We'd Iike you to come down
to the station

219
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:58,682
so we can take your statement,
or we can take you back
to the hospital.

220
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:02,986
Look, I don't have
any insurance, and I didn't
see the guy who attacked me.

221
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,659
So, I was mugged.
It happens all the time,
right?

222
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,258
So, why are you packing?

223
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:10,828
I just thought I'd take
a break from the city.

224
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:16,501
You seem a Iittle jumpy,
a Iittle nervous. Even scared.

225
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:19,546
I was attacked.
How should I act?

226
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:22,878
Is someone after you?
No.

227
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:25,343
You being threatened?
No.

228
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:29,320
BENSON: Wesley,
we know about the rape.
That's crazy.

229
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:31,552
Well, we've got semen
from the three different men

230
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,925
and a gun shot wound here.

231
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,428
What are you doing out of bed?

232
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,893
You're gonna kill yourself.

233
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:44,163
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, baby.

234
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,604
JAINA: Are you the police?

235
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:48,165
Yeah. We're here about
Wesley's assault.

236
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:51,770
I'm Jaina, Wesley's wife.
This is our Mara.

237
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:54,806
Here's your pills.

238
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:55,941
Thanks.

239
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:00,247
JAINA: So, did you
catch that mugger?

240
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:02,813
No, sweetheart,
I told them that I'd be okay.

241
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,984
We're still gonna want Wesley
to come down to the station

242
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,051
to answer a few questions.

243
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:12,057
Maybe when
he's feeling better.

244
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:16,036
Precinct or hospital,
your choice,
but we need a statement now.

245
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,307
Like I said,
the whole thing is a blank.

246
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:20,739
We appreciate your time,
anyway.

247
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:24,267
I'II show these people
to the interview room.
This way.

248
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:27,247
What's going on?
Captain wants to see you.

249
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:28,715
About what?

250
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,245
Parents are here.

251
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,680
Wesley.

252
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:34,684
Mom, Dad.

253
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:35,815
(CRYING)

254
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,984
No. Take it easy.
What happened, son?

255
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,425
Nothing. I'm okay.

256
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,292
It's been eight years.

257
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:43,991
I'm just so happy
to see you're alive.

258
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,267
STABLER: Are you ready
to talk, Wesley?

259
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:51,238
Why'd you call my parents?
I don't want them here.

260
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,934
Why'd you run away?
They do something to you?

261
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't want to talk about it.

262
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,343
Fine. We're only interested
in your assault and the rape.

263
00:12:59,414 --> 00:13:00,438
No one raped me.

264
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:03,041
Then how do you explain
the semen inside of you?

265
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:04,517
Was it consensual?

266
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:05,951
I'm married. I've got a kid.

267
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:10,082
Look, Iots of people hit for
both teams. Now, either you
were forced or you weren't.

268
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,990
Okay, I'm bisexual.
Are we done?

269
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,493
No, who shot you?

270
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,228
You're hiding something,
and we're trying to help you.

271
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,392
No. You can't.

272
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:22,028
We take rape
and assault very seriously.

273
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,572
We keep investigating
with or without help.

274
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:28,701
AII right. I was hit
outside the bar, all right?

275
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:31,075
I was knocked on the head,
and the rest is a blur.

276
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:32,170
What do you want from me?

277
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:34,545
Why don't we start
with the truth?

278
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:36,277
There's no evidence
that you were knocked out.

279
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,182
There's no contusions
to the back of your head.

280
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:40,619
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

281
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,589
Any aliases?
No.

282
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:45,718
Your husband's got two names.
You sure you don't
want to amend that?

283
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:50,060
My name is Jaina Jansen,
formerly Jaina Tobias
of Cedar Creek, Arkansas.

284
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,259
Just ask my mother-in-Iaw.

285
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,235
When did you Iast see your
husband before his attack?

286
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,398
That afternoon. He'd gone out
to run some errands,

287
00:13:58,473 --> 00:14:00,304
and when he didn't come back,
I called the police.

288
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,002
They said
I had to wait 48 hours.

289
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:03,669
Which precinct?

290
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,545
You don't believe me?

291
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:09,448
BENSON:
Wesley, it's really hard
admitting that you were raped.

292
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:12,009
You feel guilt.
You feel shame.

293
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:17,448
But you've gotta deal with it,
for yourself
and for your family.

294
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:21,261
Okay, I will.
Is the Iecture over?

295
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,767
No. What was in the envelope
Willem Mueller
passed you in the bar?

296
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,893
Payments for working
on Ray Borland's house.

297
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,631
AII of it in cash?
Yeah.

298
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:31,297
How much?

299
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,773
$4,500, which was stolen
when I got mugged.

300
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:36,208
That's an awful Iot of cash.
Must've been a big job.

301
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,044
Do a Iot of construction
with that bum
right hand of yours?

302
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,446
My other one works just fine.

303
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:44,076
Then, why use an alias,
Peter Ivanhoe?

304
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,611
I don't know. I made it up
when Jaina and I ran away.

305
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:50,351
I thought my parents would be
Iooking. I just got
in the habit of using it.

306
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:51,722
Well, what about
Jaina's parents?

307
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:55,889
They're dead. Her father
killed her mother in front
of her and then offed himself.

308
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:58,524
Nobody Iooked out
for her except for me.

309
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:01,399
Maybe you knew your hubby
was making a drug deal

310
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,529
and you don't call that
into the police.

311
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,038
Oh, my God.

312
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:07,371
You've got Wesley involved
with drugs?

313
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:09,103
No, I don't,

314
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:11,202
but it's just Iike you
to blame me for this.

315
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,180
He never gave us any trouble
until he met you.

316
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:16,877
Yeah, I suppose I seduced him,
too. Got pregnant on purpose
so he'd marry me.

317
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:19,079
I wouldn't put it
past a slut Iike you.

318
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:21,452
MUNCH: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now cut it out, you two.
Wesley Ioves me!

319
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:24,458
Ms. Jansen, wait in
the Captain's office or Ieave.

320
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,551
You park it and chill out.

321
00:15:28,363 --> 00:15:29,990
What the hell is going on?

322
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:33,796
That Iady called Mommy a slut.
What does that mean?

323
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,730
Wesley.

324
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:39,740
CHESTER: Son, wait.
Let's go.

325
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:42,935
What...
Wesley.

326
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,282
Well, that was a hell
of a family reunion.

327
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:58,326
I had a mother-in-Iaw
Iike that, I just might take
a swing at her myself.

328
00:15:58,393 --> 00:16:00,953
We checked with Cedar Creek PD
about the murder-suicide.

329
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,621
Jaina was 10
when it went down.

330
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,895
She moved in with an aunt
whose boyfriend
sexually assaulted her.

331
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:08,903
The parents said
that Wesley's always had
a soft spot for Jaina.

332
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:10,734
He even tried to get
his parents to take her in.

333
00:16:10,806 --> 00:16:12,398
Let me guess, they passed.

334
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:16,638
After that, he went from
college-bound to truant.
It became all about Jaina.

335
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:19,545
Mara's seven years old,
so Jaina ran
when she was pregnant.

336
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:23,448
To a city where the predators
know a victim
when they see one.

337
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,343
But where are we on the rape?

338
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:29,390
Without a complaining witness,
it doesn't exist.

339
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,426
I don't know why
this guy is holding back.

340
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:34,121
But being this scared,
he knows his attackers.

341
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:37,859
Still got attempted murder,
unless you want to
hand it off.

342
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,633
Have I ever?

343
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:42,366
AII right, here's what we got.

344
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:45,338
Borland claimed that
he didn't know Wesley
when we showed him his photo,

345
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:48,604
but Wesley was paid by Mueller
for Borland's
alleged home repairs.

346
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,042
It's got to be
a drug connection.

347
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:52,546
Well, Iean on Borland.
We'II get an explanation.

348
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,878
Lab report says
Mueller's DNA is a match.

349
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,077
Any takers on Borland
matching, too?

350
00:16:57,152 --> 00:17:00,713
We can't get a warrant
for his DNA
unless Mueller gives him up.

351
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,848
STABLER:
Let's bring them both in.

352
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:05,324
My client is willing to
cooperate fully.

353
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:09,160
But if the questions
go outside the scope,
I'II bury you in paper.

354
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:13,167
Well, we dream in triplicate,
so Iet's cut
the chest-thumping.

355
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:16,261
Wesley Jansen says
that he works for you.
We're acquaintances.

356
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:18,499
Then why'd you Iie to us
when you said
you didn't know him?

357
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:21,633
Most people don't want
to get involved.
I'm no different.

358
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,543
Sodomy in the First, along
with his convict history.

359
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:27,309
What do you think, Munch,
18 to 25?

360
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:29,850
Minimum.
I didn't rape anyone.

361
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,352
We're not allowed
to talk to you.
You asked for a Iawyer.

362
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:36,016
This is a no-brainer
with the DNA match
in Wesley Jansen.

363
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:38,821
Damn, I hope the perp
can do this kind of time.

364
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:41,863
He wouldn't have to
if he cooperated.
The D.A. Iikes to make deals.

365
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,694
What kind of work
did Wesley Jansen do for you?

366
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:46,427
Odd jobs,

367
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:50,267
You lied to us
about knowing him,
and you're lying right now,

368
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:53,205
He was gang-raped
by three men,

369
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:56,301
and we've ID'd one of his
attackers as your Iive-in,
Willem Mueller.

370
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:57,845
That's it. Interview's over.

371
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:00,541
What are the odds
the DNA sample from you
will match the evidence?

372
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:02,640
Get a court order,
otherwise hold your breath.

373
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,742
Mueller's facing
some pretty serious time,

374
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,483
so he's across the hall,
probably giving you up
right now.

375
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:11,185
There's nothing he can say
to incriminate me.

376
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:15,294
So, where you think
he'll do his time,
Dannemora or Sing Sing?

377
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:18,389
$100 on the big house
in Ossining,
He's got old friends up there,

378
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,025
You got to show me
the cash first,

379
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:23,594
We were making a movie.
Nobody got raped.

380
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:25,799
You can't talk to us
without your Iawyer.

381
00:18:25,874 --> 00:18:28,934
I'II sign a release
if it'II get me out of here.

382
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:31,874
Hancock the bottom.

383
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,209
What kind of movie?

384
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:36,445
Gay porn.

385
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:39,978
I produce films.

386
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:43,218
I sent Willem Mueller
to pay Wesley
for his services.

387
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,350
One of the best group scenes
we've ever shot.

388
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:46,621
And why should
we believe that?

389
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:48,663
Well, I could screen
the film for you,
if you'd Iike.

390
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,527
So, Wesley's one of your
gay porn stars?

391
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,999
Don't be ridiculous.
He's not gay.

392
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:56,595
Gay-on-straight
sells a Iot of videos,
especially if it's bareback.

393
00:18:56,671 --> 00:19:00,505
Wesley's strictly gay-for-pay
at 1,500 bucks a bang.

394
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, now we know
why Wesley wasn't cooperating.

395
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:04,670
He didn't want us
digging into his background.

396
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,680
He's either ashamed
or he's afraid of somebody.

397
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:09,774
A straight guy wouldn't
want the world to know
he's doing gay porn.

398
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,375
Maybe he's in trouble
with the mob.

399
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:14,422
Porn is a multi-billion dollar
mom-and-pop industry now.

400
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,184
The mob got out of it
a Iong time ago.

401
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,886
And wise guys never walk away
from that much cheddar.

402
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,758
Your victim was shot
in the gut,
not in the heart or the head.

403
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,731
That is a slow, painful
way to die. The motive's
got to be personal.

404
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,701
You think it's a jealous
gay costar who bought
into the make-believe?

405
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,466
If it is a criminal element,
we can offer
Wesley protection.

406
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,670
Just remind him, whoever
shot him could come back
for another try.

407
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:42,376
Excuse me,
we're Iooking for the Jansens.
No one's answering their door.

408
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,045
Is he dead? I called
the ambulance. They got here
pretty quick, considering.

409
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:48,589
What happened?
I didn't mind
Iooking in on Wesley,

410
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:51,751
but the second time I went up,
he was out cold,
so I called 911.

411
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:53,885
Do you know which hospital?

412
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:56,522
Probably St. Martin's.
You know, no insurance.

413
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:57,587
Where's Jaina?

414
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,724
Well, she had to work.

415
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,290
She Ieft me this number.
I called her.

416
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:04,862
It was some management
company, and they said
they'd give her the message.

417
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:09,938
STABLER:
Pornography isn't illegal.
Making it isn't illegal.

418
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:12,036
Now is there some reason
you neglected to tell us?

419
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:13,171
It's none of your business.

420
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,476
Who shot you, Wesley?

421
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,050
I told you I wasn't raped.
I told you I wasn't gay.

422
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,314
So, why won't you believe me
when I say I don't know?

423
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:24,222
Because our experience
has been someone Iies once,
they make it a bad habit.

424
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:27,989
I didn't Iie.
Okay, omitting the truth
is the same thing.

425
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:30,861
I see the way you're
Iooking at me.

426
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:35,369
I'm scum because I make money
having sex. So, why do you
care who shot me?

427
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:37,934
Because it's our job.

428
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:41,130
I got nothing else to say.

429
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:45,305
Look, if somebody's after you,
then no one in your family
is safe.

430
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:48,547
Where's your wife?
You Ieave her out of this.

431
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:49,709
BENSON: Either you tell us
where she is,

432
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:51,877
or we will find your wife
and find out
how much she knows.

433
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,649
PIease don't involve Jaina.
You don't understand
what you're doing.

434
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:59,217
Then you start explaining
to us, because we're
running out of options here.

435
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,100
May I help you?

436
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,511
Jaina Jansen.

437
00:21:19,581 --> 00:21:21,071
She in some kind of trouble?

438
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:25,480
If you could just wait,
I'II Iet them know
back there...

439
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:28,488
OMAN: Come on, Jaina. That's
it, honey. That's it, good.
Pick up the pace a Iittle.

440
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:32,287
Joey, just kneel down behind
her. AII right. A Iittle more
to the Ieft. Good. Good.

441
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,691
(STABLER WHISTLES)

442
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:35,423
What are you doing here?

443
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:37,488
You ruined my shot.
Who are you?

444
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:39,032
Police.
We need to talk to Jaina.

445
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,567
AII right, no, no, no,
everybody just relax.

446
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:42,466
We're not doing anything
illegal here, okay.

447
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:44,027
I'm Cal Oman,
the director of this film,

448
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:45,470
and I assure you
everything's in order.

449
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,804
Look, this isn't about you.
Can we do this Iater, please?

450
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:50,174
No, Jaina, you need to
get dressed,
because we need to talk.

451
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:53,009
Well, actually, she doesn't
have to, because
she's not under arrest.

452
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:54,446
We're making a movie here.
Time is money.

453
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,381
AII right,
stand over there, please.

454
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:58,043
Now, you know that Wesley's
back in the hospital?

455
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,143
Yeah, he called.

456
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,656
I was going to call him
back on my break. Is he okay?

457
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:04,352
He's fine.

458
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:11,097
Look, if I don't work,
I don't get paid,
and we need this money.

459
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,327
Look, am I gonna
have to call a Iawyer?
Give me the phone.

460
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,835
Why don't you call two?
They'II both tell you
to stay out of it.

461
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:18,395
Look, get a warrant
or get Iost. AII right?

462
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:20,304
This is my building,
and I don't want you here.

463
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,673
Mommy, can I have quarters
for the soda machine?

464
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:25,804
Jaina, I'm sorry.
I tried to get her,
but I couldn't stop her.

465
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,316
What in the hell
is your daughter
doing on a porn set?

466
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:37,089
Can I see my daughter, please?
She needs me.

467
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:39,023
You couldn't find
a baby-sitter?

468
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:40,288
No.

469
00:22:40,362 --> 00:22:42,421
Wesley's sick.
I had to take her with me.

470
00:22:42,497 --> 00:22:45,193
What about your in-Iaws?
Why not ask them?

471
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,666
So they can teach her
to hate me?

472
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,370
Besides, nobody
can take care of Mara
except me and Wes.

473
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,067
Yeah? Why's that?

474
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:55,609
I need to get her home.

475
00:22:55,677 --> 00:22:59,010
You're not going anywhere,
and neither is Mara.

476
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,048
I didn't do anything wrong.

477
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:03,641
We're charging you
with child endangerment.

478
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,185
You took your daughter
to a porn set.

479
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:08,086
It's not exactly a healthy
and safe environment for kids.

480
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:12,718
PIease, don't do this.
If I go to jail,
who takes care of Mara?

481
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:16,061
Either Children's Services
or your in-Iaws.

482
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:19,356
She has cystic fibrosis.

483
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:25,365
She needs constant care.
I'm doing the best that I can.

484
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:29,773
There's doctor visits
and shots, pills.

485
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:33,678
Wesley's the only one
that knows how
to do her chest therapy,

486
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,683
and somebody has to
bring in a paycheck.

487
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,582
Okay, we'II consider
putting you on notice.

488
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:42,953
That means Children's Services
will check in on you
from time to time.

489
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:45,557
What's the catch?

490
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:50,530
Well, it's pretty obvious that
Wesley doesn't care about
his own well-being. Do you?

491
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,494
I can't help you.

492
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:59,438
Jaina, somebody tried
to kill your husband.

493
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:03,576
You cooperate with us,
and you can walk
out that door.

494
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,379
You're gonna have to
arrest me.

495
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,093
We threaten to take her kid,
and she still won't talk.

496
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,186
It's not a threat.
She endangered a child.

497
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:23,992
That's enough to remove
a minor from her care.

498
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:25,794
Jaina is obviously terrified.

499
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:29,030
If the mob is connected,
we're just adding
more pressure.

500
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,468
And the daughter's terminal.

501
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,870
I don't want to put
a sick child
with Children's Services.

502
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:34,465
Can't the grandparents
take custody?

503
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,373
Well, that's not gonna help
Wesley and Jaina.

504
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:39,379
Somebody's squeezing them
to keep quiet, but aren't we
just doing the same thing?

505
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:40,436
They're jerking us around.

506
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:42,813
If we have to force them
to cooperate,
I'm fine with that.

507
00:24:42,884 --> 00:24:47,082
Yeah, Wesley got very agitated
when we told him
we were going to Jaina.

508
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:50,818
Maybe she's been
the target all along,
and he just got in the middle.

509
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:54,555
If we're thinking mob,
check into this pornographer,
Cal Oman,

510
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:56,756
see if he's a connected guy.

511
00:24:58,466 --> 00:24:59,899
Ten minutes, then I gotta
block the next shot.

512
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:03,426
Vice gave us an earful about
you. Lots of charges
from extortion to blackmail.

513
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:05,666
Lots of trumped-up charges,
but no convictions.

514
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,935
Yet.
You ever thought about
doing a movie?

515
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,569
You Iook Iike
you'd be a real natural.
You still work for
the Santuccis?

516
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:13,205
Having friends
from the old neighborhood
is not a criminal offense.

517
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:14,578
I am a filmmaker, not a hood.

518
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,310
Who finances those movies?

519
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,818
Look, why don't you just quit
fishing and get to the point?

520
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:22,084
Okay, you're pretty small
potatoes in the porn industry.

521
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:25,421
Jaina Jansen's
your only big star.
Yeah.

522
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:27,688
STABLER: For such a big draw,
she doesn't work that much.

523
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,423
Her husband get in the way?

524
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,294
The Iess she works,
the more the public wants her.

525
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:34,529
Wesley moonlighting, I mean,
that must've pissed you off.

526
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:36,297
Why? I don't use him
that much,

527
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:38,931
and now with
the bareback-riding thing,
I won't use him at all.

528
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:40,838
Yeah, but married couples
don't use condoms,

529
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:42,672
so he's putting your star
at risk.

530
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:45,508
You know, if Jaina wants
to play Russian roulette,
that's her business.

531
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,605
I made her a star. I can make
another one just Iike her.

532
00:25:47,682 --> 00:25:49,775
Yeah,
but wouldn't it be easier
just to get rid of Wesley?

533
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:51,842
Look, I hate to disappoint
you, but I didn't shoot
the bastard.

534
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,320
Okay, so, where were you
that night?
Right here. Prepping a movie.

535
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:55,788
Who were you with?

536
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:58,849
I was rehearsing one of
the new girls, Delia Sarton.

537
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:01,521
Just Iike I used to with Jaina
in the old days.

538
00:26:01,596 --> 00:26:02,927
You and Jaina were involved?

539
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:04,430
Long time ago,
but I've moved on.

540
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:05,693
Jaina's got mileage.

541
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,701
Who wants to be with a chick
that's been with
a hundred guys?

542
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,169
So, where can we find
Delia Sarton?

543
00:26:10,238 --> 00:26:14,470
She's getting a body wax.
My receptionist
will tell you where she is.

544
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,479
Hi.
Hi, Delia Sarton?

545
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:22,949
Yeah, that's me.
Cal said you wanted
to ask me questions.

546
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,951
Yeah. Did he mention why?

547
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,318
No, he didn't tell me
what to say,
if that's what you mean.

548
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:30,687
Where were you two nights ago?

549
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:33,522
From 8:30 to 1:00,
I was with Cal on set.

550
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:34,960
Do you always rehearse
that Iate?

551
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,053
AII the time.

552
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,826
How'd you get home?
I took a cab.

553
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,663
What cab company?

554
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:41,929
It was yellow.

555
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,503
What'd you do
before you went to rehearsal?

556
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:48,739
Who were you with?
Where'd you go?

557
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,868
I don't remember.

558
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:52,412
Did you know that
you can be charged
with obstruction of justice,

559
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,712
giving a false statement to
a police officer and perjury,
if this goes to trial?

560
00:26:56,784 --> 00:27:00,083
Sixteen months to three years
in Bedford Hills prison.

561
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:03,055
Delia, do you want
to change your statement?

562
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,051
I didn't mean...

563
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:12,021
I just want to be a star
Iike Jaina. Cal gives her
all the best parts.

564
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,399
Is that what he promised you
if you vouched for him?

565
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,975
He set up a gang-bang
for Jaina in Vegas.
300 guys in 10 hours.

566
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:25,501
She's gonna be
on Howard Stern.
Cal's crazy about her.

567
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,275
What do you mean, crazy?

568
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:29,248
He says she belongs to him.

569
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:33,982
PIease don't tell on me.
If Cal finds out...
Don't worry.

570
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:44,497
"File no 745243.
People v, Jaina Jansen,

571
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:46,055
"One count,
child endangerment.

572
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:48,125
"One count, unlawful dealing
with a child."

573
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:52,969
Objection. Unlawful dealing
covers minors in bars,
obscenities and prostitution.

574
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,440
That isn't the case here.

575
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,670
Pornography is a form
of Iegal prostitution.

576
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:59,941
The minor's physical,
mental and emotional welfare
was corrupted.

577
00:28:00,014 --> 00:28:02,244
I agree. How do you plead,
Mr. Schoenfeld?

578
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,682
Not guilty and request ROR.

579
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:06,276
The defendant
is a porn actress.

580
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:10,552
She took her daughter to work,
exposing her to an environment
of wanton sexual activity.

581
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:14,356
The minor child was confined
to an area where all members
of the cast are clothed.

582
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:16,329
My client did everything
to shield her daughter.

583
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:17,762
CABOT: Except to
get a baby-sitter.

584
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:20,164
The defendant's in-Iaws were
in town and were never called.

585
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,464
SCHOENFELD: The Iittle girl
suffers from cystic fibrosis.

586
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,698
She can't be Ieft
in the care of just anyone.

587
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:26,330
Then your client
should have thought of that

588
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:29,467
before she took an
innocent child to a porn set.

589
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:32,873
Your client has endangered
the welfare of a minor.

590
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:36,678
For the privilege
of her freedom,
I want $5,000, cash or bond.

591
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,218
Next case.

592
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:40,777
CLERK:
"Docket number 28763..."

593
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,185
We know Cal's connected
and we know he's got
a thing for your wife.

594
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,559
He tried to kill you.
Next time you're not
gonna be so Iucky.

595
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,860
Next time it might be
your daughter.

596
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:53,491
But maybe that's
what you want, huh?

597
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:57,129
I mean, you must be awful
tired of being saddled
with a sick kid.

598
00:28:57,205 --> 00:29:00,402
You just calm down. Calm down.
AII right.

599
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:04,741
Now, you've just assaulted
a police officer
and I'm gonna frisk you,

600
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,743
just in case any of Cal's
friends are hanging around.

601
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:11,250
And then I'm gonna arrest you
unless you start
talking to us.

602
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,685
If I say anything,
Mara gets hurt
and I can't risk it.

603
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:17,350
Then give us your statement
so we can put Cal Oman away.

604
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:18,585
We can protect you.

605
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:19,921
No, you can't.

606
00:29:21,162 --> 00:29:22,356
Jaina already tried to Ieave.

607
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,694
He said that he made her
and that she wasn't
going anywhere.

608
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:26,233
So he shot you
to prove it to her?

609
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,427
We never thought
he'd go that far.

610
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,833
He would've killed me
if that homeless guy
hadn't shown up.

611
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:33,135
So, stand up and say that.

612
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:36,973
My daughter is dying.
We do porn to pay
for her bills.

613
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:41,208
Do you understand that?
There is nothing
that I wouldn't do for her.

614
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:44,178
I'm going to bail my wife out.

615
00:29:44,252 --> 00:29:48,052
If you keep coming after us,
you're just gonna
make it worse.

616
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,602
He's boxed in pretty tight.

617
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,464
Since Cal Oman
Iied about his alibi,

618
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,598
maybe we should bring him in
and do a Iittle two-on-one.

619
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:09,165
Well, it sounds Iike fun,
but that'II give him
a heads-up

620
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:13,043
and too much time to be
working out another
explanation with his friends.

621
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:15,810
Okay, so we pull our witness
in and do a Iineup.

622
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:19,717
He IDs Oman, we Iock him down,
with no way out.

623
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:23,448
That's if Munch
and Fin can still Iocate Phil.

624
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:26,824
What a surprise,
Phil's back in rehab.

625
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:28,156
His ID won't be any good.

626
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:29,457
That's for Cabot to decide.

627
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,158
It's a waste of time. What?

628
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:34,565
Don't you think you're taking
Phil's relapse too personally?

629
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,796
He's jeopardizing the case
and making my job harder.

630
00:30:36,871 --> 00:30:38,361
I always take that personally.

631
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,964
Early on,
I had a partner Iike you
used to get worked up.

632
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:43,340
What happened?
He ate his gun.

633
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:46,442
I need you to focus, Phil.
I've got some pictures
you need to see.

634
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,607
Okay. I'm hurting bad.

635
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:53,817
We need you to identify
the guy you saw
do the shooting.

636
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:55,550
What shooting?

637
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:57,090
That's it.
I think we're done here.

638
00:30:57,158 --> 00:30:59,183
Where's the fire, AIex?
We need this.

639
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,696
Is it against the rules
to remind him of the incident?

640
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:08,096
Jog his memory about what he
went through and nothing else.

641
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:14,431
How'd you get that scratch
on your face, Phil?

642
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,377
It hurts.

643
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:21,245
Phil, you wanna be a stupid
dick and kill yourself,
you go right ahead.

644
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:24,148
I need you to Iook
at these damn pictures.

645
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,886
You gave me orange juice.
You're a nice guy.

646
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:34,826
Yeah, I'm a nice guy.
Look at the pictures.
You see anybody?

647
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:43,564
Brunette. Snub-nose revolver.

648
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:50,971
I can't take these to a judge.
Your witness
is coming off of heroin.

649
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:52,410
He was clean
during his statement.

650
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,506
We got a tox screen,
thanks to my partner,
so we're covered.

651
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,050
Can't you call in a favor?

652
00:31:57,118 --> 00:32:00,747
After working with this unit
I don't have that many Ieft.

653
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:03,554
Move! Move!

654
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:08,788
COP 1: CIear.

655
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,526
COP 2: CIear.

656
00:32:17,405 --> 00:32:18,929
It's Cal Oman.

657
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:23,768
Okay. Get me an evidence bag.
I want Prints and Ballistics
on this.

658
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:26,039
Tell the Iab. Make it a rush.

659
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:31,249
Entry wound's through
the back. He was running away.

660
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:35,380
Well, that tends to happen
when you're facing
the barrel of a gun.

661
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:42,291
AII right, take it easy.
We got a sick child in there.

662
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,369
COP 1: CIear.
CIear.

663
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:50,631
COP 2: CIear.

664
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:52,799
They're running.

665
00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:54,704
With Wesley's prints
all over the murder weapon,

666
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:56,766
this goes out citywide,
he becomes a mark.

667
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:59,404
Well, they're broke,
so they can't get that far.

668
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,041
We know where his parents
are staying. Let's go alone.

669
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,850
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

670
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:12,950
My son didn't do this.

671
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:14,654
WESLEY: Mom, you have to do
this three times a day, okay?

672
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:17,027
She will whine.
She'II say it hurts.
You can't Iet that stop you.

673
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:19,157
She will die if you don't.
Say you understand.

674
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:20,894
I understand.
On your feet, Wesley.

675
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:23,562
PIease. Just give me a second,
please?

676
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:26,364
There's six positions.
Chest, back,
both sides, all right?

677
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,772
Five minutes each.
Try to make her cough after.

678
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:31,778
If she gets a fever,
call her doctor,
Dr. Lawrence Baylord.

679
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:34,246
That's her pulmonologist.
See she takes pancreatic
enzymes also.

680
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:36,044
Don't worry.
I'II take good care of her.

681
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:39,211
(CRYING) Don't go.
Sweetie, sweetie.
AII right, Iisten.

682
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:41,811
Grandma's going to finish,
because I have to go
with the police.

683
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,618
Daddy, please!
Okay, we're not gonna cuff you

684
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:46,251
in front of her, but you
have to come with us now.

685
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:47,760
I Iove you, honey.
Wesley.

686
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:50,160
It'II be okay.
PIease don't go.

687
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:52,790
(MARA CRYING)

688
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:56,030
Come on, Mara, be a good girl.
PIease, Daddy, don't go!

689
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:58,302
PIease.
Daddy, I'm gonna miss you.

690
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,101
You have the right
to remain silent.

691
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:02,301
You have the right...
Daddy, please!

692
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:03,536
Daddy!

693
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:05,809
(COUGHING)

694
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:07,975
Daddy!

695
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:15,010
My parents took out a second
mortgage on their house
for Mara.

696
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:19,116
She's on the transplant Iist.
She's gonna be
in the hospital for awhile.

697
00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:20,785
Jaina didn't need to do
the gang-bang anymore.

698
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:24,422
So, I just went over there,
and I tried to reason
with Cal.

699
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:26,022
Reason with the man
who shot you?

700
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,466
It sounds more Iike
a motive for murder to me.

701
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:30,766
Well, that's not true. I mean,

702
00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:33,604
I'm in enough trouble
as it is,
why would I need to Iie?

703
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:37,576
Because it's the difference
between parole
and a Iife sentence.

704
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:41,037
I didn't mean to kill him.

705
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:45,017
We fought,
and he pulled the gun,
and we struggled with it,

706
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:46,781
and it went off.

707
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:49,049
Are you claiming self-defense?

708
00:34:49,123 --> 00:34:51,853
Yeah. Well, yeah.
That's how it happened.

709
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:55,385
Well, the evidence doesn't
support your story.

710
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:57,731
There were no signs
of a struggle in that room.

711
00:34:57,798 --> 00:35:01,734
And if it went down Iike
you say, the prints on the gun
would be smudged.

712
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:09,574
Where's Jaina?

713
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:11,634
She's taking care
of a few things.

714
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:16,879
She's moving back to Arkansas
with my parents.
She's gonna Iive there.

715
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:22,450
Okay.
You need to change your story,
and you need to do it now,

716
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:25,515
because once we walk out
this room, we're gonna
recommend to the prosecution

717
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:27,254
that they go for the maximum.

718
00:35:27,328 --> 00:35:31,162
But if you tell us the truth,
we will try
to get you Ieniency.

719
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,803
Our phone was ringing
off the hook.

720
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:41,797
Guys were calling
from L.A. and Vegas.

721
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:45,568
They wanted to sign her up
for bigger and better stunts.

722
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:49,514
You know, just Iining up
to turn her into
a sideshow freak.

723
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,210
So, you shot him?

724
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,719
I just wanted her out.
I didn't mean for him to die.

725
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:07,092
"File number 565429.

00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:10,563
How do you plead?

00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:11,832
I'm guilty, Your Honor.

729
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:15,569
The defendant confessed to SVU
detectives and signed
his own statement.

We're satisfied
with the facts.

Look, is there anything
you can do for my son?

735
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:36,819
Mr. Jansen, your son
has confessed to homicide.

736
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:39,127
There's nothing...
It's completely
out of our hands.

737
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,065
You know,
it's just not in him.

738
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:42,227
STABLER: Well,
with all due respect, sir,

739
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:44,396
you haven't seen your son
in a number of years.

740
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:46,666
I know my son didn't do this.

741
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:49,135
This is her fault.

742
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,736
You keep blaming Jaina
for Wesley's bad judgment.

743
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:56,544
Well, where the hell is she?
She told us she's not
going back to Arkansas.

744
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:59,609
Wesley's going through hell.
She's nowhere to be found.

745
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,177
Is Mara going with her?

746
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:03,155
Mara's going to Iive with us.

747
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,020
Well,
even if we wanted to help,

748
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:10,052
the preliminary Iab report
shows your son's prints
on the murder weapon.

749
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:14,165
I know people change,
but my son
didn't shoot anyone.

750
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,395
I hunt. I have rifles.

751
00:37:18,505 --> 00:37:20,996
Wesley, he never touched them.

752
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:23,202
Never.

753
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:30,139
Did you find any other prints
besides our perp's?

754
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:32,447
None. No smudges
and no partials,

755
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,419
but I did find prints
belonging to the victim

756
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:36,319
on the other rounds
inside the weapon.

757
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,585
That doesn't make any sense
unless you wiped it clean.

758
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:40,388
Can you tell us which hands
made the prints?

759
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:41,792
His right.

760
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,523
That's a tight trigger.

761
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,227
Wesley doesn't have the
dexterity to fire that gun.

762
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:50,395
So, why did he wipe it off
and put his prints
all over it?

763
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:53,167
Who has he been protecting
from day one?

764
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:57,907
You Ieaving?
I've got a bus to catch.

765
00:37:57,978 --> 00:38:00,139
You weren't in court today.

766
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:01,647
I just couldn't deal with it.

767
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:04,513
Your husband's going
to prison. Don't you care?

768
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:06,212
Of course I care,

769
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:11,147
but I have to accept it
and deal with reality.

770
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,093
I gotta start over.

771
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:17,487
They have porn in Arkansas,
or are you just giving it up?

772
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:20,658
Porn isn't what you think.
A Iot of it's fake.

773
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,326
And there's no way
I'm going back

774
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:25,463
to where small town people
with small minds judge me.

775
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:27,234
So, where are you headed?

776
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:29,037
Vegas, then L.A.

777
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,140
It's my Iast chance.
I really need this.

778
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:33,440
If I'm not a star
before I'm 30,

779
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:36,506
I can forget about
being a producer,
a director Iater on.

780
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,574
What about your daughter?

781
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,220
She's gonna stay
with my in-Iaws.

782
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:46,592
I'II make enough money
and send it back
till I get a nice place,

783
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,254
and I'm gonna hire
the best Iawyer for Wes.

784
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,820
So, you get to be
the porn queen

785
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:54,800
while your husband takes
the fall for a crime
he didn't commit?

786
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:58,895
You think he's innocent?

787
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:00,997
The evidence proves
that he is.

788
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:04,608
Thank God.

789
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,604
When's he getting out?

790
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,411
Why don't we go inside
and talk about it?

791
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,577
Yeah, Iet's go back inside.

792
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,822
Have you fired a gun recently?
No.

793
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,325
Then you'II agree
to a gun shot residue test.

794
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:21,418
Why?

795
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:24,157
If we find traces of gunpowder
on your skin
or on your clothes,

796
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:26,062
you're gonna need to
explain that to a judge.

797
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:29,125
Gunpowder doesn't wash off
right away, so if there
are traces, we can find it.

798
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:32,104
We're gonna need
the clothes you were wearing
the day Cal Oman was shot.

799
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:35,198
So, are they in this bag here
or on the floor?

800
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:37,873
This isn't happening.

801
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:43,713
The court will probably go
easy on you.
Terminally ill child.

802
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:47,181
You were a minor
who was coerced
into child pornography.

803
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,744
There won't be a dry eye
in the house.

804
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,153
We know you shot Cal Oman.

805
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:53,785
We just have to get you
to the Iab,
and we can prove it.

806
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:05,603
He slapped me around.
He threatened me.

807
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:09,234
I had to shoot him.

808
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:11,539
He was shot in the back,
Jaina, trying to escape.

809
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:14,843
You didn't know him.
I had to defend myself.

810
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:17,976
So, then you Iet Wesley
make the sacrifice.

811
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,915
I was a wreck.
I told him what happened.

812
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:26,790
And I didn't ask him to,
but he knows Mara needs me.

813
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,226
But you're not going
to Arkansas to be with her.

814
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:32,129
You're Ieaving your child
with her grandparents.

815
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:39,402
You don't understand
what it is Iike
to be trapped with a sick kid,

816
00:40:39,473 --> 00:40:43,034
doing three guys at a time
to pay off my debts.

817
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:49,441
I have a $50,000 contract
waiting for me in Las Vegas.

818
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:51,950
And Cal would've
taken all of it.

819
00:40:52,986 --> 00:40:55,352
He was never gonna Iet me go.

820
00:40:57,357 --> 00:41:01,521
Well, neither will
Bedford Hills. At Ieast
not for 15 years minimum.

821
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,243
What happens to Jaina now?

822
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:24,944
Your wife's pled not guilty.
She's going for self-defense.

823
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,549
What are her chances?

824
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:28,747
Doesn't Iook good.
