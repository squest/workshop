NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:03,865
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,066
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:08,076
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:11,636
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:13,648
These are their stories,

7
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:21,121
Detective Stabler,
you stated under oath that
you tested everyone

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,092
who had any personal contact
with Leslie Bello.

9
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:26,992
Is that correct?
Yes.

10
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:30,555
Did you test Mr. Hernandez,
her teacher?

11
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,201
No.
No?

12
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:36,767
Did you test her bus driver,
Mr. Campbell?

13
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:38,170
No.

14
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:41,600
Well, did you test the plumber
who fixed the bathroom drain

15
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:44,737
when Leslie was home
sick from school?
No.

16
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,179
So, in fact,

17
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:49,275
everyone who could've
been alone with Leslie
was not tested.

18
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:53,755
Leslie did not identify
the plumber as her rapist.

19
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:58,023
And 8-year-olds,
they never Iie.
Objection.

20
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:01,586
Withdrawn.
No further questions.

21
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:05,430
Redirect, Your Honor.

22
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,666
Detective Stabler,

23
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:11,673
whom did Leslie Bello
identify as her rapist?

24
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,078
Her grandfather,
Frederick Bello.

25
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:18,279
Thank you.

26
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,091
Was it scary?

27
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:37,291
Piece of cake.
AII you gotta do
is tell the truth.

28
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:39,027
Will you come with me?

29
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:43,163
Well, you know, I can't,
but I'II wait right here
until you finish.

30
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,706
Leslie Bello?

31
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,414
Is he in there?

32
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:56,747
Yeah, but he can't hurt you
anymore.

33
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:59,048
Just Iook at the person
who's talking to you

34
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:02,091
and answer their questions,
okay?

35
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,604
Morning, EIIiot.

36
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:28,210
Hey, how'd it go?

37
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:34,385
They Iet him walk.
You're kidding me.

38
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,922
Grandfather rapes
his granddaughter,
no big deal,

39
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:39,860
even though he was
the only one in the house
with gonorrhea.

40
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:42,659
Who the hell do they think
gave it to her?

42
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:48,726
Whole system's screwed up.
It's a Ioad of crap.

MAN: It's a rape-homicide,

00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,708
Victim's Jennifer Walton, 25.

45
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:01,147
The body was discovered
by her friend this morning.

46
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:03,048
The Iandlady Iet her in.

47
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:06,282
Any signs of forced entry?
No, but take a Iook.

48
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,893
Did some damage.
That's only the beginning.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

50
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:16,031
How did it end?

51
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:17,497
Found her tucked into bed,

52
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:20,365
hands bound behind her back
with pantyhose,

53
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:23,098
face pummeled,
throat slit and raped.

54
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:25,271
Any fluids?

55
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:27,969
Too much blood to tell,
but there is
perineal bruising.

56
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:31,138
We'II test the sheets
for semen.
FIN: Look at this.

00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,044
A romantic psycho.

58
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:38,819
And I thought my day
couldn't get any worse.

59
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:36,810
MUNCH: How do you spell that?
EDNA: D-U-M-A-S.

60
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:40,814
How well did you
know Jennifer?
We're both dog Iovers.

61
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:44,182
We'd exchange stories
sometimes at the dog run.

62
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,050
Did she ever mention
a boyfriend?

63
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:47,783
Last month she said

64
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:51,793
she was going away
for a weekend with
someone named David.

65
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,955
She asked me to take care
of her Iittle puppy, Max.

66
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:59,429
I bet he wants his breakfast.
Did you ever meet this David?

67
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:01,265
Well, not formally,

68
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:06,036
but I saw him sometimes
standing outside her door

69
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:08,599
right there.
What's he Iook Iike?

70
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:12,339
Tall, graying hair.

71
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,542
He brought her flowers,
so I figured it was him.

72
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:15,914
What kind of flowers?

73
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:20,251
Begonias and daisies,
roses.

74
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:22,188
He stop by Iast night?

75
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:26,483
I think they were fighting.
About what?

76
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:27,958
He was yelling so Ioud.

77
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,898
Something about
she was trying
to ruin his Iife.

78
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:35,061
I should've
checked up on her.

(DOG WHINING)

80
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:40,168
STABLER: What store?
Wheaton's Department Store.

81
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,903
We planned to meet for drinks.

82
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:44,070
When?
Around 9:00.

83
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,636
8:30 she called my cell,

84
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,842
said a friend
stopped by from work
and she'd be Iate.

85
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,077
She mention a name?

86
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:52,177
No, but I heard
a man's voice
in the background.

87
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:54,154
What'd it sound Iike?

88
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,319
Did he have an accent?
Did he sound angry?

89
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,886
I don't know.
What about Jennifer?

90
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:04,498
Was she upset,
nervous?

91
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,434
I'm not sure.

92
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:10,167
Is there anything
you're sure about?
We only talked for a moment.

93
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,433
EIIiot.

94
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:14,469
We'II be in touch.

95
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,940
Looks Iike
she was entertaining.

96
00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:21,278
One glass with Iipstick.
Our perp a teetotaler?

97
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,374
Neat freak.

98
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,578
Found the other glass
in the kitchen
on the drying rack

99
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:27,417
along with a carving knife,
both washed totally clean.

100
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,482
So much for evidence.
Well, we've got blood.

101
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:33,895
Probably Ianded
the first blow here.

102
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:37,763
Then he dragged her
from the couch
into the bedroom.

103
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:41,436
STABLER: Surprised he didn't
shampoo the rug.

104
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:43,802
Victim's clothes
folded nice and neat.

105
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,636
Buttons are all gone.
After he ripped them
from her body.

106
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:50,968
Bag them all.

107
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,279
There's no sign of
a struggle here.

108
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,081
The blow must've stunned her,
maybe even knocked her out.

109
00:06:58,154 --> 00:07:00,315
So, he Iays her on the bed,
and he ties her up.

110
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,414
He beats her
and he rapes her.

111
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:04,692
I'd say you're Iooking
for a Iefty.

112
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,854
He drew the blade
across her throat,
slicing the Ieft carotid,

113
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,522
sending the spray
against the wall.

114
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,032
Kitchen knife Iooks
good for the weapon.

115
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:15,730
When he's finished with her,
heads for the bathroom.

116
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,637
Hey.
Hey. Found traces of blood
in the sink

117
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:20,834
and also around
the shower drain.

118
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,400
Okay.

119
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,106
So, he showers.
He gets dressed.

120
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:27,945
He washes the wine glass
and the knife,

121
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:32,249
strolls out the front door,
takes his dirty towels
with him.

122
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:35,757
You got it all figured out.
At Ieast I'm trying.

123
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:40,859
Check the drain traps.
Hear that?
Get the tub and the sink.

124
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,092
You're thinking
crime of passion?

125
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:45,929
Really did a number on her.
Hell of a Iot of rage.

126
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:47,901
But he wasn't out of control.

127
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,632
Still had the presence of mind
to clean up after himself.

128
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:53,869
Maybe that's because
the violence is actually
soothing to him.

129
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:56,912
You see, the initial outburst
triggers a flood of serotonin
to his brain,

130
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,571
which calms him
while he acts out his anger.

131
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,171
The more he maims,
the better he feels.

132
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,149
Exactly, and then once
his rage dissipates,

133
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:04,584
he's gentle, he's Ioving.
He tucks her into bed.

134
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:07,053
He folds her clothes,
puts a flower on her pillow.

135
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:09,056
So, what are we
Iooking for?

136
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,591
Well, he wooed her
before he killed her.

137
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,220
He's intelligent, articulate,
maybe even charming.

138
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:16,389
Any Ieads on the boyfriend?

139
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:24,029
EIIiot and I are heading
to Wheaton's to follow up
on her visitor from work.

140
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,972
Munch, Fin,
stick with forensics.

141
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,600
As meticulous
as this guy was,

142
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:31,976
Iet's hope he Ieft something
behind in all that carnage.

143
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,607
Multiple facial
and mandibular fractures.

144
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,811
Knocked out four front teeth,
two embedded
in the soft palate.

145
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,218
Any idea what
he beat her with?

146
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,256
His fists,
by the bruise patterns.

147
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:43,223
He could have cut himself
on a broken tooth.

148
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:46,853
I'II canvas the ERs
for hand injuries.
Anything else?

149
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:50,421
Traces of spermicide,
most Iikely from a condom,
but no semen,

150
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,023
and something odd.

151
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:55,628
Two circular incisions
on her chest
where the dermis was excised.

152
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,763
What's his game?
I don't know,

153
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,571
but the hell
this woman went through,
death was a blessing.

154
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:07,277
DARCY: You gotta find
whoever did this,

155
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,715
We're Iooking for someone
who might be able to help.

00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:13,482
A guy by the name of David.
You mean David Stedman?

157
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,990
He work here?
He's the manager
in Women's Shoes.

158
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:17,855
Were he
and Jenny involved?

159
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:21,385
He's a married man.
Not that it ever stopped him.

160
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:24,365
Stopped him from what?
Chasing women.

161
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:28,096
He's shameless.
Even after Tammy filed
that harassment suit.

162
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,900
Who's Tammy?
She worked in Cosmetics.

163
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:33,942
She told him
she had a boyfriend,
but he wouldn't back off.

164
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,807
She finally had to transfer
to the Brooklyn store.

165
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,006
Is that when David
turned his attentions
to Jenny?

166
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,173
Yeah.

167
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:44,117
He started
coming around on breaks,
asking her to Iunch.

168
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:46,785
I warned her,

169
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:51,556
but she insisted
they were just friends.
But you didn't believe that?

170
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:55,256
It's impossible for David
to be "just friends"
with a woman.

171
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:57,828
Is he working today?

172
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:00,994
Up the escalator
and on your right.

173
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:05,540
Look what this shoe does
for the Iine of your Ieg.

174
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,575
Very sexy.
I don't know.
They're awfully expensive.

175
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,942
But you're worth it.

176
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:13,981
David Stedman?
Be right with you.

177
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:16,108
We'd Iike to talk to you now.
I'm with a customer.

178
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:19,586
She'II understand.
I think you better
talk to them.

179
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,658
What happened to your hand?
I broke a knuckle.

180
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:26,786
How?

181
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,423
Banged it against a door.

182
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,361
She really must have
pissed you off.

183
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:38,697
Who?
Jennifer Walton.

184
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,174
Neighbor saw you
go into the apartment,
heard you two arguing.

185
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:44,542
You get off
on beating up women?
Make you feel good?

186
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:48,675
I never touched her.
BENSON: Well, we saw
the hole in the door.

187
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:52,920
Is that what this is about?
'Cause I'II pay for
the damned door, okay?

188
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,388
What set you off there,
shoe boy?

189
00:10:57,092 --> 00:10:59,822
She was gonna file
a complaint with my boss.

190
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:01,123
She said I was harassing her.

191
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:04,757
That's a bad habit of yours,
harassing the Iadies,
isn't it?

192
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,026
I only asked her to dinner.

193
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,164
You murdered her.

194
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:13,466
What?

195
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:16,308
She's dead?

196
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,913
No more dancing.
EIIiot.

197
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:21,211
You tried to get
into her pants,
and she wouldn't go for it,

198
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:22,614
so you smacked her.
No.

199
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:24,812
No? Then, tell me
what happened, huh?
EIIiot.

200
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:26,013
Huh? Just tell me
what happened.

201
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:27,385
She Iaughed at you,
'cause you couldn't
get it up?

202
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:28,480
No!
EIIiot, knock it off.

203
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:29,546
She made fun of
your manhood,

204
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,219
and then you decided
to teach her a Iesson,
so you pounded it into her,

205
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:34,319
and then you raped her
and you sliced her throat.

206
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:35,420
No, I punched her door.
EIIiot.

207
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:38,261
You raped her.
You sliced her throat.
She threw me out, I swear.

208
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,800
What time?
Yeah.

209
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,701
7:00.
No, witness puts you there
at 8:30.

210
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,230
No.

211
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:48,003
No. I was at the hospital
by 8:00.

212
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:51,535
You don't believe me,
call the ER at Mercy General.

213
00:11:57,352 --> 00:11:59,877
What are you doing?
You itching for a Iawsuit?

214
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:03,447
Just cutting through the crap.
He's calling his Iawyer.

215
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:07,188
Well, God bless the Iawyers.
EIIiot, hey,
it's my ass, too.

216
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:10,459
Don't worry about it.
I'II make sure it's covered.

217
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:18,465
David Stedman,
signed in 7:47 p.m.,
discharged 1 2:52 a.m.

218
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,599
What took so Iong?
It's a busy night.

219
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:23,201
And he would've gotten in
sooner if he hadn't kept
hitting on me.

220
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,404
I saw his wedding ring.

221
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,778
Every time he made a move,
I dropped him
to the bottom of the Iist.

222
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:28,373
Great.

223
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:30,649
Thank you.

224
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,746
So, we start over.

225
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:37,726
Face pummeled, 5-inch Iac
to the throat.
How deep?

226
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:41,889
Carotid partially severed.
BP thready. 70 palp.
Ran four units of saline.

227
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,625
WOMAN: Take her to 3.

228
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,362
We're on it.
What?

229
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:48,001
That was Munch calling
from the crime scene.

230
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,698
I think we just met
victim number two.

231
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,638
(WOMAN CHATTERING
OVER PA SYSTEM)

232
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:04,610
Celia Mitchum, second victim,
25, teacher's aide
at Thornton EIementary.

233
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,711
Landlord found her
tucked into bed,

234
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,451
hands tied, face beaten,
throat cut.

235
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:11,891
After which
the perp took a shower,
did the dishes

236
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,327
and Ieft a white rose
on her pillow.
Just Iike the other one.

237
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:16,591
Have you seen this MO before?

238
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,690
Not around here.
We're checking with VICAP.

239
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:22,168
He's got his act down.
He's too organized
to be a first-timer.

240
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:25,104
And he knows what he Iikes,
blonde, blue eyes, petite,

241
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:27,665
both worked with children.
Mother fixation?

242
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:29,404
I'd say more Iike
a romantic ideal.

243
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:31,742
He shared a bottle of wine
with Jennifer.
He Iit a candle.

244
00:13:31,814 --> 00:13:33,042
What about Celia?

245
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:35,345
Having coffee,
munching on some chocolates.

246
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,681
Don't forget the roses.
White roses.

247
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:39,846
The symbol of innocence
and purity.

248
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:42,482
Unfortunately, no woman
fulfills his fantasy.

249
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:46,494
So, his frustration
just keeps escalating until
he can't contain himself.

250
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:47,688
What else?

251
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:50,596
He tailors his approach.
Wine for Jennifer,
chocolates for Celia.

252
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,328
This means that
he studied them.
He possibly knew them.

253
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:57,270
He's white, educated,
probably middle-management.

254
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,967
Why didn't you pick up
on this before?

255
00:13:57,275 --> 00:14:00,836
'Cause the pattern
didn't emerge until
the second victim.

256
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,539
How Iong's he
been doing it?

257
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:05,276
Long enough to perfect
a pretty sophisticated MO.

258
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,977
Five, maybe 10 years.

259
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:10,613
You'II have to go a hell of
a Iot farther back than that.

260
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,984
HAWKINS: EIIiot.

261
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:16,657
John. What do you need?
A few minutes with your boss.

262
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:18,355
Detective Hawkins?
Captain Cragen.

263
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,661
Come on in. EIIiot, join us.

264
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,598
Who the hell is that?

265
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:26,034
Wyatt Earp.

266
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,099
Shut the door.

267
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:36,313
You two know each other?
I took his class
at the Academy.

268
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:39,350
AIways had him
figured for Homicide.
I guess he had other ideas.

269
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,611
What's this about?

270
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:44,121
Detective Hawkins has
some information he thinks
bears on your serial killer.

271
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:45,281
Okay.

272
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:48,223
You remember
the SoHo Strangler?

273
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,155
Roger Berry, early '80s.

274
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:52,287
Beat and raped his victims,
and then he strangled them.

275
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:54,832
You put him away.
He's out.

276
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,800
Paroled six months ago.

277
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:59,401
Well, our guy doesn't
squeeze their throats.
He cuts them.

278
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:00,768
Tucks them into bed?
Yeah.

279
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,467
Leaves a white rose
on their pillow?
Okay, maybe we got a copycat.

280
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,530
I wouldn't count on it.

281
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:06,600
We never released
that Iittle detail
about the rose

282
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:09,272
or the fact that
he tied his victims' wrists
with a Navy slipknot.

283
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:11,474
Berry was a biter.
Still is.

284
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,278
Only now he cuts the bite
marks off their chests,

285
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:15,512
so you can't match them
to his dental records.

286
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:17,487
Roger's had a few years
to sweat the details.

287
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,046
Okay, well, thanks a Iot.
We'II check it out.

288
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,922
You can ride with me.

289
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:27,697
Brass called this morning.

290
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:30,098
Detective Hawkins
has a Iot of experience
with Berry.

291
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:32,466
He's been temporarily
reassigned here.

292
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:37,299
Oh, so, now I need
a babysitter?
It's no reflection on you.

293
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:40,810
This isn't right, Captain.
It's how it is.

294
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,937
Yeah.

295
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:47,374
His name's Roger Berry.
I miss one
damn parole hearing,

296
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,181
and the morons Iet him
walk on good behavior.

297
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:52,815
I see you've met everybody.
Hawk's a real take-charge
kind of guy.

298
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:55,860
What makes you think
it's Berry?
Fits his signature.

299
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,589
I read up on the first victim.
What've you got on the second?

300
00:15:58,663 --> 00:16:02,190
Scene wiped clean,
except for a contact Iens
on the bathroom floor.

301
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:05,964
Victim's med records
says she's 20/20.
Roger's got Iousy eyesight.

302
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:08,062
Where exactly do we
find this Roger?

303
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,903
His PO's got him working
at a flower shop on 32nd.

304
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:13,171
They sell white roses?
Check it out.

305
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:15,974
BENSON: Benson. Yeah.
We'II take Roger's apartment.

306
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:19,073
Okay. That was the Iab
with forensics.
So, go.

307
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,415
EIIiot and I can take
care of ourselves, can't we?

308
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:27,987
Coffee cups, chocolates,
roses, silverware.

309
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,153
Wasn't able to get anything.
Same nothing
as the first crime scene.

310
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:33,789
He did use the same
Navy slipknot on both victims.

311
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:36,095
What about the contact Iens?
Contact Iens.

312
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,158
Whoever Iost it is Iucky
he didn't walk into any walls.

313
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:41,034
We calibrated the prescription
at 20/150.

314
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:42,266
Any DNA on it?

315
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,969
No, but we found hair samples
in the drain traps
from both apartments.

316
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:49,172
They didn't belong
to either victim,
but they matched each other.

317
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,339
The killer.

318
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:52,315
Good news is the barb
was still attached
to one of them.

319
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:53,373
If there's enough DNA,

320
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:55,248
we can run it against
the sample they took
from Roger Berry

321
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,687
when he was paroled.
Now all we have to do
is find him.

322
00:16:58,757 --> 00:16:59,746
See you.

323
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:05,393
Your partner
always so friendly?

324
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,624
Well, she just
doesn't Iike you.

325
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:09,826
Wail till she gets to know me.

326
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,266
Here we go.

327
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,535
Hey, Roger,
it's your old buddy, Hawk.
Open up.

328
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:17,871
Roger. Probably out
walking his dog.

329
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:22,778
You got a warrant?
Don't need one.
PO's prerogative.

330
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:27,507
Well, I don't see
a parole officer,

331
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:30,053
unless that drunk
we stepped over
has got a badge.

332
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:31,611
He'II be here.

333
00:17:33,191 --> 00:17:36,160
You sure
this is Roger's apartment?
Oh, yeah.

334
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:38,752
Yeah, well, our shrink said
our guy's middle-management.

335
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,297
Oh, he did, did he?
Oh, he did,

336
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:43,300
and he also said that
he's meticulous.
Meticulous?

337
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:47,134
Check the bed.
Hospital corners.

338
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,339
"Happy birthday. Love, Mom."
We got a pair
of running shoes.

339
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,844
You think she knew
we were coming?

340
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,549
Well, well, Iookie here.

341
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,944
Guess he didn't have time
to put them in his scrapbook.

342
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:05,455
Jennifer Walton
and Celia Mitchum.

343
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:09,560
You're Iate.
Hey, cross-town traffic's
a bitch.

344
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:11,959
Detective Stabler,
Eddie Tobias, Roger's PO.

345
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,362
How you doing?
Where's our boy?

346
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,423
You were supposed
to be keeping track of him.

347
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:19,163
He wasn't at work today.
Home was the next best bet.

348
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:20,864
When he's in trouble,
he usually runs to Mama.

349
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:23,237
She still in that shotgun
house out in Queens?

350
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:25,742
Couldn't pry her out
with a crowbar.

351
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,506
The neighbors tried to
when they found out
what her Iittle boy did.

352
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,572
Thanks, Eddie.
CIose the door
on your way out.

353
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,217
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

354
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:35,744
You.

355
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,555
That's right, Mrs. Berry.
It's me.

356
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:40,747
I got nothing to say.

357
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:43,988
Your boy's at it again.
He raped and killed
two more women.

358
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:47,054
You're trespassing.
Where is he?

359
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:50,659
I'm not gonna Iet you
railroad him
Iike you did before.

360
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:51,997
Roger confessed.

361
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,834
You tricked him.
He didn't know
what he was doing.

362
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:56,373
He knew exactly
what he was doing.

363
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:59,137
You stole 18 years
of his Iife.

364
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:01,209
(COUGHING)

365
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:06,682
Ma'am, he surrenders himself,
he gets a fair shake.

366
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:09,777
I give you my word.
You're all Iiars!

367
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:14,791
I find out you're hiding him
again, I'II run you in
for accessory after the fact.

368
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:18,224
You don't scare me.

369
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:21,156
It's gonna be a Iot easier
if you give him up now.

370
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:23,928
Roger keeps running,
he's Iiable to get hurt.

371
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,367
Go to hell!

372
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:31,367
You trying to kill her?
No. She's tougher
than she Iooks.

373
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:34,104
Last time, she hid Roger
in her basement
for three weeks,

374
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:36,113
meanwhile two more women
wound up dead.

375
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:39,344
Sure as hell
ain't gonna help us now.
You think she would?

376
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:43,012
Sometimes finesse
goes a Iong way.
Finesse is for fairies.

377
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:45,681
Look, I don't care
how many strings
you pulled to get here,

378
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:47,554
but you're working my case.

379
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,121
My case.

380
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:52,728
So, from now on,
we do it my way,
you got that?

381
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:55,425
You hungry?
What?

382
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,230
Roger used to eat
at this restaurant every day
about the same time.

383
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:00,396
Thought we'd grab a bite.

384
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:02,899
You hear me?
Yeah.

385
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:06,307
But if I don't get something
in my gut before Iong,
I'm gonna pass out.

386
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:07,708
You drive.

387
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,572
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

388
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:15,285
Oh, yeah. Roger.

389
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:17,719
He started coming in
a few months back.

390
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,520
Orders the same dinner.
Cheeseburger and a root beer.

391
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:23,686
Takes it to
his favorite table.

392
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,786
STABLER: Yeah, he's got
a standing reservation?

393
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:28,354
Well, you know,
he's a Iittle off.

394
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,527
It's gotta be that table
or nothing. He'II wait an hour
for people to Ieave.

395
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:34,572
So, I put a Iittle sign up,
save him the trouble.

396
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:37,608
How are the cheeseburgers,
still the same?
Big and greasy.

397
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:40,200
HAWKINS: I'II take two.
One for me
and one for my partner.

398
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:42,269
My treat.
To drink?

399
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:44,508
Double bourbon. Neat.

400
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:46,777
Beer. A bottle of domestic.

401
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:50,414
We'II have our burgers,
nail our perp and be home
for the 11:00 news.

402
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:53,651
You're awfully cocky
for someone who's been
striking out all day.

403
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:56,125
Well, Roger's a creature
of habit. He'II be here.

404
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:57,821
Whatever you say.

405
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:02,459
You wanna talk about
that bug up your ass
or just Iet it fester?

406
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,831
I just don't Iike
grandstanders.

407
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:07,894
I thought you were gonna
say grandfathers.

408
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:14,538
That was a tough one to Iose.

409
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,145
That jury sent him home
to rape that kid
all over again.

410
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:21,845
You make your case?
I had him nailed.

411
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:24,218
Then you did your job.

412
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:27,783
Well, that's not good
enough anymore.
Well, it has to be,

413
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,986
because that's all there is.

414
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:35,725
I told that Iittle girl
everything was gonna be okay.

415
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,031
And I told the parents
of Roger's victims
he'd rot in prison.

416
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:40,730
Well,
at Ieast you put him
away for 18.

417
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:44,263
Yeah, well, at Ieast
you gave that Iittle girl
a few days' peace.

418

Just so tired of Iosing.

420
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:55,876

00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:57,076
Huh?

422

I don't know.

424
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:10,297
AII that's required for evil
to triumph is for good men
to do nothing.

425
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,926
Here's to a few good men.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

427
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:22,336
Stabler. Yeah, John.

428
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,639
STABLER: Really?

429
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:30,516
Well, we'II Iet you know
if he shows up here.

430
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:32,283
Wasn't a total bust
at the flower shop.

431
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:34,689
The owner told Munch
that Roger made deliveries

432
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:37,728
to Jennifer Walton's
apartment building a week
before she was murdered.

433
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:39,990
That's the way
he accessed his victims
Iast time around.

434
00:22:40,064 --> 00:22:43,864
He also said that
Roger got fired
for threatening a customer.

435
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:45,896
Our boy's Iate.

436
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,404
Sometimes he gets caught up
watching the boats.

437
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:50,600
Yeah, where?
Pier 41.

It's me, Hawk.

Turn around real slow,
and we'II handle this
Iike men, all right?

443
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:32,549
Stay away from me.
Can't do that, Roger.

444
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:36,346
I won't go back there.
That's not an option, Roger.

No.

Your collar.

456
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:04,110
Roger Berry,

457
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:08,347
you're under arrest for
the murders of Jennifer Walton
and Celia Mitchum.

458
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,381
No.
You have the right
to remain silent.

459
00:24:10,456 --> 00:24:11,445
No.

460
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:14,356
If you give up that right,
anything you say can...

461
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:20,163
We almost Iost you, there,
Roger.
I don't want to talk to you.

462
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:21,392
I don't really want to
talk to you, either,

463
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:23,401
but we've got some Ioose ends
we gotta tie up.

464
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:25,869
Where were you
night before Iast?

465
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:30,066
It was my birthday.
I was with my mother.
AII night?

466
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,610
After we ate cake,
I went home.
What time?

467
00:24:33,946 --> 00:24:35,436
Lights out by 10:00.

468
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:38,244
You stop by Celia Mitchum's
on the way home?

469
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:39,375
Who's that?

470
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:42,386
That's that nice Iady
you brought flowers to
day before yesterday.

471
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:44,445
I bring flowers
to Iots of nice Iadies.

472
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:47,219
Yeah, but this one
you killed, Roger.

473
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:48,683
No.

474
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:52,627
(CLEARS THROAT)
What about Jennifer Walton?
I didn't kill anybody.

475
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:56,596
Then why'd you cut their
stories out of the paper?
See here?

476
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,727
My mom gave me those.

477
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:01,864
She said, "Be careful."
You was gonna try
to put me back in jail.

478
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,272
Roger, you're not going back
if you didn't do it.

479
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:07,506
You Iie just Iike he Iied.
Here we go.

480
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:10,176
You said
if I signed that paper,
I could go home.

481
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:12,979
We don't send murderers home,
we send them to prison.

482
00:25:13,051 --> 00:25:15,542
Now, admit it, Roger,
you took those girls flowers.

483
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:17,179
No.
You pretended to be
their friend...

484
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:19,019
No. No.
...and then you raped them
and killed them.

485
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:20,251
No!

and this time
I'm gonna see to it

and put a needle in your arm.

No.

We've got nothing
to hold him on.

499
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:05,499
It's Roger's signature.
It's the killer's signature.

500
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,138
Meaning what?

501
00:26:08,307 --> 00:26:11,504
The guy's
borderline retarded.
You think he's capable?

502
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:13,135
Roger's smarter
than you think he is.

503
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:14,644
You give me some time
alone with him,

504
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:16,305
and I'II have him singing
a different tune by Iunch.

505
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:18,008
Nobody's talking
to Roger alone.

506
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,347
His mother reached out
to Legal Aid.
He's Iawyered up.

507
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:22,614
And with no DNA,
we've got no grounds
for arrest.

00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:25,088
Well, while you all sit around
with your thumb up your ass,

509
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:29,184
I'II take Roger's mug
out to recanvas.
You remember, police work.

510
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:34,160
It's hard to make
a case for a copycat

511
00:26:34,232 --> 00:26:37,224
when the signature wasn't
released to the press.

512
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:39,497
There is another explanation.

513
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:44,167
Roger Berry's not
the SoHo Strangler.

514
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:50,547
Hit the archives,
take a fresh Iook at
the old strangler files.

515
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:54,582
If this strangler's been
out there all this time,
he must have Ieft a scent.

516
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:57,451
Hawk would never admit that
he's wrong, especially if
he hears it from a woman.

517
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,786
He's old-school.
He's a drunk.

518
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:01,450
I talked to a cop
at Manhattan South.

519
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:02,754
They said that nobody
will ride with him.

520
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,056
Well, maybe they don't
have the guts.

521
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:05,721
Well, maybe they just
want to stay alive.

522
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:06,923
Maybe they should shut up
and do their...

523
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:09,467
I'm just telling you
to watch your back.

524
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:12,128
Sorry, Detectives,

been checked out.

00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:13,796
Under what name?

526
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,340
Detective John Hawkins,
Manhattan South Homicide.

527
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:21,743
Son of a bitch,
he's covering his ass.

John, it's EIIiot.
You in there?

HAWKINS ON TAPE:
You just wanted her
to stop screaming,

532
00:27:32,124 --> 00:27:34,524
I didn't want her
to scream,

533
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:38,593
You tied her up,
grabbed her by the throat,
I don't,,,

534
00:27:38,664 --> 00:27:40,359
HAWKINS: It's open.
Damn it, Roger,
Stop screwing around,

535
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:44,493
I want the truth,
If I say it,
can I go home?

536
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:48,567
Tell me what happened,
Okay,

537
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:51,273
Okay, what?

538
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:53,367
I grabbed her,

539
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:56,046
You raped her,
I raped her,

540
00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:59,443
Then you put the flower
on her pillow and left,

541
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,849
I gave her the flower
and left,

542
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:05,213
You left her dead,
Dead,

543
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:11,621
Just spending some quality
time with my old friend,
the SoHo Strangler.

You and Roger?

545
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,833
Found a neighbor
that alibied him.

Puts Roger at home
when Jenny and Celia
were killed.

547
00:28:26,712 --> 00:28:29,545
I don't need any DNA
to tell me the rest.

548
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:33,010
We'II get the guy.

549
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:38,220
You know, when I first caught
this case, I had my shield
only for one year.

550
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:43,452
Wanted to show everybody
what a kick-ass cop I was.

551
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,499
Six murders Iater,
I'm still drawing blanks.

552
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:55,130
So, as usual,
the media's up our ass,
talking about taking me off.

553
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:57,840
Then we catch a break.

554
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:03,246
A neighbor sees
a flower delivery man Ieaving
Larissa Cutler's apartment.

555
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:07,650
I go down to the flower shop,
search his truck,
strike the mother Iode.

556
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,586
Women's underwear, porno,

557
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:12,681
the same kind of rope
used to tie their hands.

558
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,488
You made your case.

559
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:18,420
Not without a confession.

560
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:26,936
I wanted that so bad.

561
00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:34,846
I put Roger in the box
and I grilled him
over and over and over,

562
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:39,406
till I convinced myself
he'd been
in those apartments.

563
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:44,613
I fed him every detail
of the case.

564
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:50,084
And then I told him that
if he signed that confession,

565
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,290
he'd go home to his mother.

566
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,962
Poor dumb son of a bitch
believed me.

567
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,834
You have a chance
to make this right.

568
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:11,481
I took 18 years
from an innocent man.

569
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:13,776
God knows how many women
died because of it.

570
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,583
You can't make something
Iike that right.

571
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:20,517
Okay, so,
what are you gonna do?
Quit?

572
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:33,034
You wanna drink yourself
to death? I can't stop you.

573
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:37,231
But what are you
gonna tell the parents
of those girls?

574
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,971
You made a promise to them.

575
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:45,739
If you're the man
that I think you are,
you'II keep it.

577
00:30:56,295 --> 00:30:58,195
Hawk!
You don't have to shout.

578
00:30:58,264 --> 00:30:59,856
I think I found something.

579
00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:02,594
Believe me,
I've been over that stuff
till my eyes bled out.

580
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:04,329
If there was anything to find,
I'd have found it.

581
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:05,734
Arthur BIessard?
Huh?

582
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:07,830
Do you remember a guy
named Arthur BIessard?

583
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,432
Yeah.
He's one of the neighbors
that ID'd Roger.

Ann Chilsen's date book
three weeks before
she was murdered.

585
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:16,841
She had an appointment
with her tax man. "AB."

586
00:31:18,718 --> 00:31:21,448
I'II be damned. Come on.

587
00:31:25,858 --> 00:31:27,120
It's a Iong shot.

588
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:29,753
Everything's a Iong shot
till you connect the Iast dot.

589
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:33,060
What are we Iooking for?
These are my notes
on the strangler case.

590
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:37,193
I used to sketch faces
to keep the interviews
straight in my head.

591
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,295
Son of a bitch.

592
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:43,006
Who's this?
Artie BIessard.
Guy was blind as a bat.

593
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:47,503
Like the guy who Ieft
his contact on Celia Mitchum's
bathroom floor.

594
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,047
The Iast dot.

595
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:51,416
We traced the MO
from the 1983 strangulations

596
00:31:51,484 --> 00:31:52,542
to the current murders.

597
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:55,348
VICAP came back
with 12 more hits
from five different cities.

598
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:56,888
Arthur BIessard's
employment history

599
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,719
puts him in the vicinity
of seven of those murders.

600
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,316
They show the evolution
of Arthur's MO over time.

601
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:04,022
We're still contacting
Iocal PDs, but all we can
come up with is

602
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,463
Chicago is where he began
to mutilate his victims
to hide the bite marks.

00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:09,467
And he started slitting
throats in Atlanta.

604
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:12,732
BENSON: In every case,
the signature matches.

605
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:15,235
So, where is this
Arthur BIessard now?

606
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,869
Well, he quit his job
at some storefront tax outfit
in Hartford Iast month.

607
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,469
Hawk is out checking
with the Feds,

608
00:32:20,546 --> 00:32:22,776
see if they have any info
on subsequent employment.

609
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:24,406
AIready done.
Where?

610
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:27,941
26 Federal PIaza.
The bastard's working
for the IRS.

611
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:31,888
His desk is right over here
in the corner.

612
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:34,989
Where the hell is he?

613
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:37,823
Probably out in the field.
He's one of
our busiest auditors.

614
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:38,921
Oh, really?

615
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,022
Excuse me.
What?

616
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:41,191
Hey.

617
00:32:42,768 --> 00:32:45,396
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't you need
a search warrant?

618
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,863
Got it covered.

619
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:50,708
HAWKINS: Here we go.

620
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:53,370
Jennifer Walton.
Celia Mitchum.

621
00:32:53,913 --> 00:32:55,074
He's using their tax return
as a dating service.

622
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:59,050
Employment, marital status,
home address. He's even got
their photos from the DMV.

623
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,916
Got an appointment book.

624
00:33:00,988 --> 00:33:05,925
Beverly Parsons.
34 1/2 West 23rd Street.
5:00 p.m.

625
00:33:05,993 --> 00:33:07,324
It's 4:45.

626
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:10,761
HAWKINS: This is it.

627
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:12,493
(GLASS SHATTERING)

628
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,435
STABLER: Police! Don't move.
Oh, my God!

629
00:33:17,504 --> 00:33:19,495
Hi, Artie. Remember me?

630
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,239
Spread your Iegs.
What is this?

631
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,970
Arthur BIessard,
you're under arrest

632
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,807
for the murders
of Jennifer Walton
and Celia Mitchum.

633
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,574
Murder?
Did he hurt you?

634
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:29,979
No, I cut myself
when I dropped the vase.

635
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,540
Artie was helping me
clean it up.

636
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:35,315
Yeah, Artie's a real neat guy.
And a hopeless romantic.

637
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,755
Since when is it a crime
to bring a Iady flowers?

638
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:40,156
You got a date
with me now, boy.

639
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:47,332
BEVERLY:
Artie first contacted me
a week ago

640
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,892
about irregularities
on my tax return.

641
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,267
I'd just moved here
from Ithaca

642
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:53,636
and couldn't afford
to fly in my accountant,

643
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:55,174
but he said that was okay.

644
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:58,336
He thought the discrepancies
could be cleared up
without much trouble.

645
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,245
And then,
so, you met with him?
At his office.

646
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:04,772
He seemed really nice.
He'd found more problems
with my return,

647
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:06,910
and when he saw
how nervous that made me,

648
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:09,012
he offered to take me
to Iunch.

649
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:12,957
I felt sorry for her.
You know,
audits can be nerve-racking.

650
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:17,355
But when you're in a new city
and no family or friends,

651
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,729
it can be
downright terrifying.

652
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:23,534
You give that kind of
personal attention
to all your audits?

653
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,572
We're not all
soulless bureaucrats,
Detective.

654
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,770
He called me at the hospital,
I'm a pedes nurse,

655
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:34,610
and said he'd accidentally
double-booked.

656
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:38,845
He apologized and insisted
on making it up to me

657
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:40,717
by taking me to dinner.

658
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,277
Dinner was her idea.

659
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:47,589
Well, aren't there...rules
against fraternizing?

660
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:51,353
Her audit
was winding down,

661
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:55,424
and she seemed Iike
a nice enough girl.
So, I said, "What the heck?"

662
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,164
That's when things
got weird.

663
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:03,934
He started asking me
a Iot of questions
about my personal Iife,

664
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,376
and then tonight he showed up
at my apartment with flowers.

665
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:11,979
I shouldn't have Iet him in,

666
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:15,215
but I thought
I could Iet him down gently
without screwing up my taxes.

667
00:35:15,288 --> 00:35:18,655
So, why'd you come back,
Artie? Temptation too great?

668
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:22,323
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Come on.

669
00:35:22,562 --> 00:35:25,554
Roger Berry.
I put him away
for what you did.

670
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,998
His parole gave you
carte blanche
to murder again.

671
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:29,660
You knew he'd be
the prime suspect.

672
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:31,966
This time we've got
DNA evidence, Artie.

673
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:35,496
You know
what that means, Artie?
It means we've got you.

674
00:35:36,443 --> 00:35:37,933
This is crazy.

675
00:35:38,211 --> 00:35:39,473
You know what's crazy, Artie?

676
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:41,946
Sitting in your 8x10 cell
eating your Iast meal.

677
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,745
Or walking down the hallways
to that Iittle room
with the gurney.

678
00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:47,218
Are you trying to
make me confess?

679
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:48,777
You want to save your ass,
don't you, Artie?

680
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,289
I'm not going to Iie.
We can tie you
to both victims.

681
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,292
I did their taxes.
In their bedrooms?

682
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,760
That would be
a breach of ethics.

683
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:58,491
Keep it up, Artie.

684
00:35:58,598 --> 00:35:59,724
Keep it up,
and I swear to God,

685
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,994
I'II put your head
through that wall.

686
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:04,434
I'II be sure and tell that
to my Iawyer.

687
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:05,801
STABLER:
I didn't say anything.

688
00:36:07,474 --> 00:36:11,069
We searched Artie's apartment
and found a Iens case
with a single contact.

689
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:13,135
AIso found a receipt
from Jean's FIowers.

690
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,238
The same flower shop
where Roger works.

691
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:17,909
It's obvious
he was setting Roger up.

692
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:22,243
Any Iuck with Artie?
He Iawyered up.
Can we hold him?

693
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:23,914
Unfortunately,
we have nothing
to hold him on.

694
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,390
What about the flowers
and the contact?
Circumstantial.

695
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,051
Well, what about the DNA
from the hair?

696
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:30,028
He will argue
he was an invited guest.

697
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:31,222
That's a stretch,
isn't it?

698
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:32,993
CABOT:
He had Iegitimate business
with both victims,

699
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,624
just as he did with Beverly.

700
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:37,499
Circumstantial or not,
we've made cases on Iess.

701
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:41,735
This time we have to contend
with history. Roger Berry,
SoHo Strangler.

702
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:43,275
Roger didn't do it.

703
00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:45,208
His convictions are a matter
of public record,

704
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:48,270
which provides
a very compelling argument
for reasonable doubt.

705
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:49,906
He had access, opportunity,

706
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,814
and according
to his arrest file,
the same signature.

707
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:53,147
So, Artie just walks?

708
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,189
If we take this to trial
and he's acquitted,
he gets a Iifetime pass.

709
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:59,487
So, unless we can tie him
more definitively
to these murders,

710
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,254
the answer is yes.

711
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,534
Wait a minute.
What about the old murders?

712
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,767
Artie wasn't
as experienced back then
or nearly as neat.

713
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,808
You thinking he might have
Ieft a deposit?

714
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:19,367
It's 18 years ago,
but those evidence boxes
are still at Pearson PIace.

715
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:21,309
VARGAS:
We went over everything
with a fine-tooth comb.

716
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:24,680
The rope, Iingerie,
fingerprint slides,
all useless.

717
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:26,416
What about the bite marks?

718
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:29,922
Only subcutaneous bruising
of petechiae. Nothing we could
match to a suspect.

719
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,117
There's gotta be something.

720
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:34,120
We took a closer Iook
at this bed sheet.

721
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:36,424
It belongs
to the first victim,
Marcia Johnston.

722
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:37,929
The bookstore clerk.
VARGAS: Correct.

723
00:37:37,998 --> 00:37:39,158
According to the inventory,

724
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:41,666
a mixture of blood and semen
was typed from this spot.

725
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:44,226
We were able to extract
enough DNA to run a panel.

726
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,432
The only problem is,
is the sample is mixed.

727
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:49,873
Meaning what?
Meaning we need DNA

728
00:37:49,943 --> 00:37:53,208
from both the suspect
and the victim
to make an accurate analysis.

729
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,408
But the victim's been dead
and buried for 18 years.

730
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,848
Unbury her.

731
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:00,617
No. I won't allow it.

732
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:02,845
Let Marcia rest in peace.

733
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:05,816
I know how difficult
this must be for you,
Mrs. Johnston, but...

734
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:07,917
No, you don't.

735
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:12,991
There isn't a day goes by
I don't think
about my daughter.

736
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,833
There was a time
I couldn't even do that,

737
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:22,967
because I couldn't bear
the thought about
the horrible way she died.

738
00:38:25,712 --> 00:38:27,805
I finally got to the point

739
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:32,511
where I could Iook
at her picture
without breaking into tears.

740
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,057
Mrs. Johnston,

741
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:42,458
I put the wrong man away
for 18 years

742
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,054
for your daughter's murder.

743
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:46,689
Now I've gotta
carry that burden

744
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:50,532
along with the deaths
of all the other daughters
since then.

745
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,538
I promise to put
Marcia's killer away.

746
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:56,132
I can't do it
without your help.

747
00:38:58,012 --> 00:38:59,604
How many others?

748
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:02,314
Seven that we know of.

749
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:05,552
If I don't get it
right this time,

750
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:08,554
there's a man out there
that's gonna keep on killing.

751
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:11,318
What exactly will you
have to do to her?

752
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:15,294
We need to extract
a sample of DNA for analysis

753
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,164
from one of her bones.

754
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:20,757
And there's no other way?

755
00:39:20,935 --> 00:39:23,597
Unfortunately,
Marcia's our Iast hope.

756
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:25,928
My Iast hope.

BIessard's gonna be
awfully surprised to see us.

759
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:52,096
I can't wait to see
that son of a bitch's face.
Get the back.

Hawk, don't do this.

768
00:42:03,497 --> 00:42:06,523
Don't do what, partner?
STABLER: You know
this isn't right.

We both know
the system sucks.

it's just natural selection.

STABLER: Hawk, you do this,
you're no better than he is.

He sure as hell
won't kill anybody else.
