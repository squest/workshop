NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,233
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:05,399
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:08,410
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:12,005
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:13,946
These are their stories,

7
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:17,915
Damn it to crap, Brody.

8
00:00:17,987 --> 00:00:19,716
We're only a day
behind schedule.

9
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,780
Yeah, well,
I got drywallers starting.

10
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,827
So I suggest you shift
your Iazy ass into high gear.

11
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,158
Catch the hell up.

12
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,791
Maybe you should think twice
before insulting a man
wearing a tool belt.

13
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:34,325
Yeah, you know,
if you weren't married
to my sister...

14
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:38,440
What the hell is this?

15
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:41,940
That wasn't here
when we Ieft.

16
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,546
CONTRACTOR: Son of a bitch.

17
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:50,643
The Iittle girl's body
was discovered by the general
contractor and a carpenter

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,154
at 6:53 a.m.
This our point of entry?

19
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:56,680
Yeah, one nail holding a piece
of plywood. Didn't take
a Herculean effort.

20
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,354
And they both
handled the sword,
so it's contaminated.

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,398
She was killed with a sword?

22
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:03,796
No stab wounds,

23
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:06,699
but hematemesis indicates
internal bleeding.

24
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,000
BIunt force trauma.
Bruises, sternum to toe.

25
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:13,266
With this?
We'II check it
for trace evidence.

26
00:01:13,342 --> 00:01:15,037
Looks Iike it was made here
out of floor scraps.

27
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:16,203
Is this the victim's braid?

28
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:20,079
Looks Iike it.
I'd say cut with a knife,
not scissors.

29
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,777
Restraint marks on the wrists
and ankles. Where's the rope?

30
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:24,217
Didn't find any.

31
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,255
Signs of sexual abuse?

32
00:01:26,322 --> 00:01:30,588
Extensive bruising
and swelling in the pelvic
region. I'II run a kit.

33
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,150
What's her name?
Any idea who killed her?

34
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:35,163
AII right, guys, please.
That's enough. This way,
ma'am, please. Come on.

35
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:36,596
I went in to check on my...
I understand.

36
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,690
...my Iittle girl.

37
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:39,530
But Cassie wasn't
in her bed, and I...

38
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:41,092
How old is your daughter?

39
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,899
She's five.
She's my foster daughter.

40
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:44,337
Okay.
Can you describe her for us?

41
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:48,400
She's black. She got her hair
in Iittle braids.

42
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:49,843
She's, Iike, 40 pounds.

43
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:52,380
Why don't you come with me,
okay?

44
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,473
WOMAN:
Excuse me, sir. Pardon me.

45
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,450
Sound Iike we have an ID?
Yeah, it's bad.

46
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,454
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Captain Cragen,
can you give us anything?

47
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:01,422
We'II have a statement
shortly.

48
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:04,756
JANE: Oh, my God! No!

49
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:59,708
Victim is Cassie Adams,
aged five.

50
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:03,218
She was found beaten to death
at a construction site
across her street.

51
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:04,878
FIN: Someone snatched her
right out of bed.

52
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:07,616
Foster mom said they'd
been having problems
with her sleepwalking.

53
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,782
Is there a foster dad?

54
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:10,120
Everything but.

55
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:13,060
Foster mom,
foster grandmother,
the victim's two sisters.

56
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,689
I believe the grandmother
has a foster kid of her own.

57
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:17,756
Full house.
What's this, a sword?

58
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,892
Yeah, with the victim's braid
attached.

59
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:22,130
Some kind of ritual killing?
Or a gang symbol.

60
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:26,005
There's a crew on 149th Street
that wears a Sword
of Damascus tat.

61
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,236
Could be the prop
of some whack job.

62
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:29,778
Or an ex-con.

63
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:32,279
This is basically
a big old shiv.

64
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:34,578
Well, Iet's start with known
pedophiles in the area.

65
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,619
Canvass the block.
Let's find out
who had access to that site.

66
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:41,123
Oh, and check out this
address. It was on the victim.

67
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,624
We ran it, but there's
no phone connected.

68
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:45,160
Want us to interview
the foster family?

69
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:47,253
Benson and Stabler
are there right now.

70
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:52,195
(SWORDS CLANGING ON TV)

71
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,266
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Level 7,

72
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,867
Tanya, now when did you
Iast see Cassie?

73
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:03,673
When I went to bed.
Okay.

74
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:06,442
GIenn, honey,
turn that thing down.

75
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:07,709
WHITLEY: Grandma.

76
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:11,914
And did you hear anything
Iast night?
No.

77

(SOBBING)

78
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,359
STABLER: We're good?
Yeah.

79
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:20,118
Which one was Cassie's bed?

80
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:23,165
The bottom bunk.
Tanya has the top.

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,125
And Whitley's
is three feet away.

82
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:29,569
AII they know is she was gone
when they woke up.

83
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,766
Well, we'd Iike to take
everyone down to our precinct.

84
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,900
Fewer distractions,
they might remember something.

85
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:38,072
They have been through
so much. The dad died in jail.

86
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:41,173
The mom used to drag them out
panhandling.

87
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,979
She'd use them as sympathy.

88
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:46,249
Mother still in the picture?
No. Supervised visits.

89
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:48,688
We'd meet her at McDonald's
every two weeks.

90
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:53,559
It always really upset Cassie
for days after.

91
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,790
When was the Iast visitation?

92
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,492
Day and a half ago.

93
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,796
And it's only the mom
on these visits?

94
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:03,032
She brought her boyfriend
the Iast time.

95
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:05,573
Made the girls
very uncomfortable.

96
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,880
FIN: Do you know
a Cassie Adams?

97
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:16,076
How's that concern you?
Take that as a yes.

98
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:18,586
Why are you asking
about my daughter?

99
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:22,152
Child Services
didn't contact you?

100
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:24,891
About what?

101
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:30,358
We're very sorry to have to
tell you this, but your
daughter Cassie is dead.

102
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:33,695
No.

103
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:39,164
No! God, no! No, no, no!

104
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:43,678
No! No! No!

105
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:49,112
Anger management
an issue with her?

106
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:52,450
At ACS, yeah, man.
She was fighting Iike hell
to get them back.

107
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:56,480
So having a close friend
snatch one back
isn't out of the question.

108
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,319
You know, girl doesn't want
to go, puts up a struggle.

109
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:02,057
Accidents happen.

110
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:05,558
Why you talking to me
Iike I'm a suspect?

111
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:09,035
Account for your whereabouts
Iast night
and I'II adjust my tone.

112
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,266
I play sax at Harvel's.

113
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,171
I just got Tashandra a job
waitressing there,

114
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:15,437
and we were both there
until 3:00 this morning.

115
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:17,706
Tashandra Iives here with you?

116
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,647
Officially,
she's still at the shelter,
but she's spending nights.

117
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:23,583
Then why was Cassie
carrying this address?

118
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,515
I don't know.
You gotta ask Shandra.

119
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:29,353
I always wrote down
where I was for her.

120
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:32,087
It was a comfort.

121
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:35,257
I need to be with my babies.

122
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:36,559
They're okay.

123
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:39,931
They're with the detectives
trying to sort this out.

124
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:45,963
You know, Cassie's
my middle child, but she was
always the mother hen.

125
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:50,311
And I don't know
what Whitley and Tanya
are going to do without her.

126
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,279
How Iong have you been apart?

127
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:54,612
Ten months.

128
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:57,113
I'II get them back now,
won't I?

129
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:58,653
It's up to
Children's Services.

130
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:03,021
But it's their fault.
They stole my kids.

131
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:06,721
I thought if I had my girls
with me, I could protect them.

132
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:11,422
You tell them
that I need to protect
the two that I got Ieft.

133
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,331
That's not my call.

134
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:16,500
You have to take me
to see them.

135
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,238
I'm sorry, I really can't.
PIease.

136
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:24,473
PIease, don't make me
have to go to them and beg.

137
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:27,209
PIease.

138
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:34,648
Liv's upstairs with
the eight-year-old sister,
Wong's got the three-year-old,

139
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,156
and I'm running out of rooms.

140
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:39,388
I'II put up a "Do Not Disturb"
sign. Talk to the boy
in observation...

141
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:40,622
You Iousy bitch!
MUNCH: Tashandra...

142
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:43,859
What did you do to
my daughter? What did you do
to my daughter?

143
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,697
MUNCH: Tashandra, please,
this isn't helping.
How could you Iet this happen?

144
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,498
Calm down, ma'am,
okay, calm down.

145
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:52,007
No, no, I want to see
my daughters. Whitley! Tanya!

146
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:53,200
My office here. Let's go.

147
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:55,471
Here's your juice.

148
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:02,710
So Tanya, can you tell me
what happened Iast night?

149
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,043
I don't know.

150
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:10,016
Well, when you went to bed,
who was in the room?

151
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,023
Whitley and Cassie.

152
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:18,358
Tanya, we know that Cassie
Ieft the room Iast night,
but do you know how?

153
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,564
No.

154
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,408
Hey, GIenn,
tell me about Cassie.

155
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,340
She was always bugging me
to use my PIayStation,
but she was too Iittle.

156
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,851
I wish I had Iet her now.

157
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:44,422
It must have been hard
for you, all of a sudden
having three sisters.

158
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,220
No.

159
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:50,154
I Iike being a big brother.
Do you?

160
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,062
You Iook out for them?

161
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,432
I try to.

162
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:01,734
Did you ever go over
to the construction site?

163
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,936
Yeah.

164
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:06,174
How about Cassie?

165
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:11,114
She's not supposed to cross
the street by herself.

166
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,645
She'd ask me to take her.

167
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:15,917
Why?

168
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:19,255
She Iikes to talk
to one of the workers.

169
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,596
Did you and Cassie ever go
to the building site
without GIenn?

170
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,898
Mmm-hmm.

171
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:32,841
And when you guys
would go over there,
who would Cassie talk to?

172
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:35,172
Danny.
Who's Danny?

173
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:39,745
He's nice.
The other ones chased us away.

174
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,947
Oh. How is Danny nice?

175
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:47,146
He gave us gum
and showed us stuff
in the house.

176
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,456
CONTRACTOR:
Gotta be Danny Marston.

177
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,087
MUNCH: You don't mind him
conducting his Fun Time
Learning Emporium

178
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:55,187
on company time?

179
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:57,255
Hey, Danny's one of
the hardest workers I got.

180
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,631
Guy that's good with kids
must have a bunch of his own.

181
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,602
Not yet.
But he coaches Little League

182
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,002
and he volunteers
in a bunch of youth programs.

183
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,665
Where's Danny now?

184
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,869
I had to send my whole crew
home after you declared it
a crime scene.

185
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:10,241
Where's he hang his hardhat?

186
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:12,576
My secretary can give you
his address.

187
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:16,414
If he's not at home,
try the Youth Rec Center
on 123rd.

188
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,043
Guy's a saint.

189
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,082
MUNCH: Danny Marston?
Yeah.

190
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,127
Steal a minute
of your time?

191
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:27,219
Sure.

192
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:29,355
Hey, keep it going guys.

193
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,302
Little girl was found dead
at your place of work.

194
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,099
We understand that you and her
were buddies.

195
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,661
God, it's tragic.

196
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,935
I mean, she came around
every day.

197
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,239
Budding architect, asking me
hundreds of questions.

198
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:43,972
See, he wasn't being
inappropriately friendly,

199
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:46,571
he was schmoozing up
a future boss.

200
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:48,472
Inappropriate?

201
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:53,447
Listen, the kid never had
a father figure.

202
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:56,053
I mean,
most of the kids I work with
are in that situation.

203
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,116
You make toys
for all of them?

204
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:02,357
I made her a Iittle airplane
out of scrap.
Took all of two seconds.

205
00:11:03,232 --> 00:11:05,029
What?
Where were you Iast night?

206
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,466
Home.
FIN: Can anyone verify that?

207
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:08,798
No.

208
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:10,905
Why would they need to?

209
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:13,840
Maybe we should finish this
down at the squad room.

210
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:17,843
We're in the middle
of a game here.

211
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,710
You really want to
do this in front of them?

212
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:21,977
Damage their Iittle psyches?

213
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:26,318
Andre, take over here.

214
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:32,323
I am not a pedophile.

215
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:36,554
And I refuse to stop helping
kids in need just to avoid
being Iabeled one.

216
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,156
I didn't do it.

217
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:40,934
Tell me how
I prove a negative.

218
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:42,436
Tell the truth.

219
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:47,108
You've never seen anyone
at that construction site
after hours?

220
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:56,211
I never even thought of it
until I started getting
the third degree.

221
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:58,616
I Ieft my thermos there
Iast week.

222
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:00,678
When I went back, a couple
of kids had broken in.

223
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,018
Vandals?

224
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,693
No.
Who?

225
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:08,887
Cassie and an older kid.

226
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:13,199
Listen, I know it Iooks bad,
but I'm sure
it's just coincidence.

227
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:14,564
What is?

228
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:19,403
They both had sticks.
When I went in,
they were sword fighting.

229
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:22,470
You need to describe
this older kid to us.

230
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,877
A white boy she's always with.

231
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:31,509
I think his name's GIenn.

232
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:41,693
Her foster brother?

233
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:44,096
He had access to the home
and to the crime scene.

234
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,997
And he did fail to mention
that his sister's murder site

235
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:47,660
was also
their secret playground.

236
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:50,204
This family is still grieving
the Ioss of one child.

237
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:52,797
We're gonna need
a hell of a Iot more
before we take away another.

238
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,333
It could be that he had
motive. He was an only child,
a Iittle slow.

239
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:59,539
Three younger, cuter sisters
move in, attention
gets split four ways.

240
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:01,515
Fourteen years old,
raging hormones.

241
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,177
Look, before you place
this kid on death row,

242
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:07,051
Iet's see if we can place him
at the crime scene.

243
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:15,863
Why do we always
get stuck with Iooking for
the needle in the haystack?

244
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:18,229
Takes me back to
the Easter-egg hunts
of my youth.

245
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,097
You're Jewish.
Your parents hid eggs?

246
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:23,400
My point exactly. AII those
futile hours of searching.

247
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:28,542
Now, if you were still
a bright-eyed Iittle kid, what
would that Iook Iike to you?

248
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,634
A deathtrap.

249
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:32,874
You're pathetic.
That's the coolest fort ever.

250
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,183
You had a traumatic childhood
too, huh, Sherlock?

251
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:48,091
Mother Iode. Comic books.

252
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:50,898
Walkman.

253
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,331
Penknife.

254
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:55,433
That Iook sharp enough
to cut off a braid of hair?

255
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:58,166
If it is, you win
the chocolate bunny.

256
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,739
GIenn's been sent
to the Guidance Center
many times.

257
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,474
Fights?
Yeah.

258
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:04,606
He's a bully?

259
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:07,015
On the contrary.
He's the one bullied.

260
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:12,717
This is where he spends
half his day with the other
Special Ed students.

261
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,227
You know,
I've talked to GIenn. He's...
He's borderline.

262
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:19,752
He's a Iittle slower
than the average student,
a Iittle bigger,

263
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:23,767
and he won't fight back,
which makes him
a constant target.

264
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:26,633
That's gotta get to him.
It did once.

265
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:30,368
He threw a chair
across the room.
It exploded into pieces.

266
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:33,639
Are you doing anything
to protect
these targeted kids?

267
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:37,678
GIenn has a rich fantasy Iife
that he retreats to.

268
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:39,876
Whenever I try to discuss
his problems,

269
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:43,887
all he'II talk about is
this Camelot-type video game.

270
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,586
Camelot? Like, jousting?
Sword-fighting?
That kind of thing?

271
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:52,358
Yeah. His teachers have tried
to interest him in books
with similar mythical themes,

272
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,830
but there's something
about this game.

273
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,561
Graphic violence.

274
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:59,297
Read his case file.
It's nothing new.

275
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:02,833
GIenn was one of our
saddest cases.

276
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,739
It's a miracle he's adjusted
as well as he has.

277
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:05,833
Abuse?

278
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:08,379
While his mother was out
prostituting herself
for drug money,

279
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:11,074
the boyfriend was at home
molesting GIenn.

280
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,481
Sometimes he'd resort
to objects.

281
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,519
And when did you get him?
Not soon enough.

282
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:18,522
The abuse started at two.
We got him at four.

283
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,490
If you'd seen the emptiness
in that boy's eyes.

284
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:22,082
Did he bounce around
for a Iong time?

285
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,991
On that front he was Iucky.

286
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:26,360
We placed him
with Dorothy Rudd right away.

287
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:27,989
She's had him ever since.

288
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,830
She ever have any troubles
with him?
Not that I know of.

289
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,268
Women Iike Dorothy
are hard to find.

290
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:36,501
With a Iot of these kids,
the families have no idea
what they're getting into.

291
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:37,802
Still, with GIenn's
background,

292
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:40,811
weren't you at all concerned
about placing three
young girls in the house?

293
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,868
No.

294
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:46,179
My case worker met with
the boy, and he seemed
very excited about it.

295
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:51,188
Stainless steel.
Mass-produced.
Swiss Army knock-off.

296
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:55,488
Standard issue for any boy
over eight. Anything making
this one unique?

297
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,653
Say, maybe some kid carving
his initials in the handle?

298
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,128
Oh, better.

299
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:02,431
Ten-point gem.

300
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,400
I ran it, but he's not
in the system.

301
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:06,130
System doesn't
include juvies.

302
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:10,868
The size and shape
are consistent with a boy
on the Iarge side or a woman.

303
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:17,404
AIthough given these,
I'd stick with a Ionely,
frustrated adolescent.

304
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:20,713
An outcast with $4-a-day
cheese puff habit.

305
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:22,343
You Iift those
from the comic books?

306
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,910
Corner of every page.

307
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:27,049
The girl didn't die
from a paper cut.
Anything else on the knife?

308
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,958
Just a hair caught
in the fold.

309
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:37,201
It's the one on the Ieft.
The one on the right's
the victim's.

310
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:38,428
It's identical.

311
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:41,563
Which puts Cheese Puff Boy
at the crime scene
the night of the murder.

312
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,266
Now you've just got that
one Iittle hitch.

313
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:45,635
What's that?

314
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,701
The sword is not
your murder weapon.

315
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,610
But she was hit with it.

316
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:52,275
See the imperfections
in the wood?

317
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:56,418
With this Ievel of impact,
it would have picked up fiber
or soft tissue evidence.

318
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:57,648
Maybe he wiped it clean.

319
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,587
Pattern doesn't match.

320
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:02,717
BIeeds spread their mass out
differently depending
on the weapon.

321
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:06,958
These came from something
perfectly cylindrical
with no rough edges.

322
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:08,795
Broomstick?
Baseball bat? What?

323
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,165
Heavier than a broomstick,
narrower than a bat.

324
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:14,797
There was a pile of copper
piping at the crime scene.

325
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:16,067
Maybe.

326
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:19,668
Whatever it was, it was hefty
enough to cause these.

327
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:23,009
Subcutaneous bruises,
multiple fractures,

328
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:26,244
metacarpals, tibia, humerus.

329
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:27,443
STABLER: What killed her?

330
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,386
BIed out from a Iacerated
Iiver. A slow death.

331
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:32,985
Rape kit results in yet?

332
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:36,357
There were no fluids.
I found no evidence
of penetration.

333
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:38,259
I thought you said you did.

334
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:41,628
I said there was swelling.
It was from the beating.

335
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:46,294
Anything else?

336
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:48,965
Look at the different hues
from the trauma.

337
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,907
The most recent are
erythematous with welts.

338
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:56,572
The purplish areas with
extravasation were already
forming hematomas.

339
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,843
Meaning that she was beaten
over an extended period
of time.

340
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,646
At Ieast 1 2 hours.

341
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:06,457
Did you notice any bruises
on Cassie
when you put her to bed?

342
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:07,616
No. But she was...

343
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:11,492
Neither of us put her to bed.
She was already asleep
when we got home.

344
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:12,552
You were out?

345
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,860
Just for a few hours, yeah.

346
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:17,527
Where were you?
Delia Nathan's,
right up the street.

347
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,797
We play cards every Tuesday.

348
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:22,873
Why didn't
you mention this before?

349
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:24,772
Because it was a Iot earlier
in the evening.

350
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:27,073
We checked in on her
when we got home.

351
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,612
BENSON: Who was babysitting?

352
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,738
GIenn.

353
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:37,420
No, he didn't do
anything wrong.
She was tucked soundly in bed.

354
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,787
GIenn ever play rough
with the girls?

355
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:43,524
Well, he Iiked to wrestle.

356
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:48,123
He's big for his age,
and sometimes he didn't know
his own strength.

357
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:50,793
He did. He did play rough
with them sometimes.

358
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,633
We're going to need to
speak with GIenn.

359
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:56,164
GIenn?

360
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,209
GIenn, honey, please...
GLENN: Just a minute.

361
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:01,871
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Kill the Gorgon
or the princess shall die,

362
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:03,072
Hi, GIenn.
What are you playing?

363
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:05,275
GLENN: Come on, come on.
One more Ievel.

364
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,342
DOROTHY: GIenn, stop.
This is serious.

365
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,586
They need to talk to you now.

366
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:12,484
EIIiot.

367
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:15,682
Right down to the braid
of hair.

368
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:25,659
GIenn, we found your sword.

369
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,265
The one that you Ieft
with Cassie.

370
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:36,572
STABLER:
Okay, what's a Gorgon?

371
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:38,912
Gonna be okay, GIenn.

372
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:41,474
Can you tell us what happened
that night?

373
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:43,886
(MUMBLING)

374
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,622
Got to help her...
Save Cassie...

375
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,922
Were you watching the girls?

376
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:54,093
Cassie. Cassie. Cassie.

377
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:55,694
BENSON: GIenn.

378
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,733
GIenn, do you know
how Cassie got hurt?

379
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:02,364
STABLER:
Were you playing games?
Gorgon. Gorgon killed her.

380
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:06,205
PIease,
I know he didn't mean to.
It had to be an accident.

381
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:07,266
Mrs. Rudd...

382
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,870
Tell them, GIenn.
Tell them it was an accident.

383
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:12,815
(SHOUTING)
It was...
It's those video games.

384
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:15,318
DOROTHY: Stop it.
You're hurting yourself.

385
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:16,919
(SCREAMING)

386
00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:20,180
BENSON: GIenn.

387
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:25,184
DOROTHY: You're hurting him!
You're hurting him!

388
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,462
You're hurting him!

389
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:37,741
How's GIenn doing?
Psych unit at Hillview.

390
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:38,867
You read the report?

391
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:43,004
Yeah. Agitation, aggression,
paranoid delusions.

392
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:44,708
Your boy had
a psychotic break.

393
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:46,306
AImost took our
two-way with him.

394
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:49,581
His mind didn't short-circuit
for no reason. He's clearly
under tremendous pressure.

395
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:51,087
Guilty conscience?

396
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:54,454
Need to confess
versus self-preservation.
That'II make you crazy.

397
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,686
MUNCH: Damn it!
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
You have lost,

398
00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:00,162
Pathetic. Give me that.
Show you how to do this.

399
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:03,792
Maybe we should rethink
the squad room video arcade.

400
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:05,768
GIenn retreated
into that game.

401
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:09,136
Well, considering what he went
through his first four years
of Iife, who wouldn't?

402
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:12,335
Not to mention the physical
and emotional abuse
he's taken at school.

403
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,399
Let's just make this case.

404
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:15,503
The Super Mario Brothers
up there can re-canvass.

405
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,309
You two, go visit the boy.

406
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:21,883
BENSON: Mrs. Rudd.

407
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:25,579
What are you doing here?

408
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,648
We need to see GIenn.
No, you don't.

409
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,386
You stay away from him.

410
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,896
That's okay. You know what?
Why don't we sit down?

411
00:21:32,964 --> 00:21:35,899
Tried to get him a snack.
Stuck.

412
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:46,607
It's his favorite.

413
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:48,305
How's GIenn holding up?

414
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:53,114
I've never seen him Iike this.

415
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:55,383
GIenn is...

416
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:58,719
He's a sick boy.

417
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:02,951
And if we do this right,
we can make sure wherever
he goes, he gets help.

418
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:07,020
Maybe I was too old
when I took him in.
I thought I was up to it.

419
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,867
But I was being selfish.

420
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:13,661
It's just...
I Iove having kids around.

421
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:17,633
Mrs. Rudd, you do understand
that we need to talk to GIenn.

422
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:18,903
Doesn't he have any rights?

423
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,570
Yes, he does,
but he's a juvenile.

424
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,546
You can waive Miranda for him.

425
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:25,809
I don't know.

426
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:31,377
The Iast time you questioned
him, he was so upset, I...

427
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:37,724
No, I think I should
talk to a Iawyer.

428
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:43,155
Mrs. Rudd...
No, I can stand.
I don't need any help.

429
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:49,035
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Level Thirteen,

430
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:51,302
(ELECTRONIC VOICE SPEAKING)

431
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:56,370
Game's over. Looks Iike
Dorothy's going to Iawyer up
the kid.

432
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:57,210
How Iong have you been
playing that game?

433
00:22:57,282 --> 00:23:00,342
Your Captain's
found his calling.
He made it to the final Ievel.

434
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,513
I defeated the Gorgon,
freed the forest
from evil demons,

435
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:06,251
and rescued the dying princess
from her dungeon.

436
00:23:06,325 --> 00:23:07,383
Princess? Nice.

437
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:09,859
Oh, wait till you hear
how he Iifted the spell
she was under.

438
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:12,260
A sword
and a Iock of her hair.

439
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,861
It gets better.

440
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,901
I carried her
to the secret cave,

441
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:20,370
I tied the hair to the sword
and placed it at the entrance.

442
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,066
She's as good as new.

443
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:28,745
So if we follow the game,
then GIenn killed Cassie
and then tried to save her?

444
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:30,979
Killer's remorse?

445
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,008
What doesn't track is GIenn
identified with the boy hero,
not the Gorgon.

446
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:38,682
Wait, what exactly
is a Gorgon?

447
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:40,918
Are you familiar with Medusa?

448
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:45,354
GIenn's monster's a woman.

449
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:47,462
MUNCH: Captain!

450
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:52,161
That was Jane Rudd.
Guess who just
snatched her two other girls?

451
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,070
I was in the kitchen
when Tanya got in from school,

452
00:23:58,143 --> 00:24:01,510
and she comes in and she says,
"Oh, Whitley,
it's time to go."

453
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,480
And I said,
"Hey, go where, honey?"

454
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:05,517
And that's when I saw them
standing in the doorway...

455
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,779
Are you talking about
Tashandra and her boyfriend?

456
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,788
His name was Duke.
I don't remember

That's okay, we do. Why don't
you have a seat, Jane?

Don't worry about it.
We're gonna find them.

461
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:24,901
Did they say anything
that might tell us
where they were heading?

462
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,168
AII she did was curse at me.
God, I wish my mother
had been here!

happen to my other two?

STABLER: That doesn't mitigate
what you did.

490
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:59,489

you're Iooking at

That's a felony.
I didn't have a choice.

They were in danger. I had to
get them out of there.

That woman murdered
my daughter.

Mrs. Adams, I understand
that you're under

00:26:19,718 --> 00:26:21,913
What did she tell you?
Not a Iot.

498
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:25,445
But that's only because
that woman had her too scared.

We put them back with Jane.
May we see the file?

503
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:52,743
You know, there are over
500,000 kids in foster care.

504
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:56,113
It's not easy trying to find
a place for all of them.

505
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:59,487
Do you realize that a serious
allegation has been made
against her?

506
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:01,219
By Tashandra Adams.

507
00:27:01,293 --> 00:27:03,227
It's about the only thing
she hasn't tried.

508
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:05,320
STABLER: What's this Ietter
from the BIuebell Agency?

509
00:27:05,397 --> 00:27:07,194
That was a reference check.

510
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,495
Jane had two foster kids
before the Adams girls.

511
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:13,333
This other agency removed
them. Two months Iater,
she came here.

512
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:14,429
Why were they removed?

513
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:19,739
Seems Jane "experienced
difficulty understanding
her role as a foster parent."

514
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:20,835
What does that mean?

515
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:23,073
The children were found
with soiled clothes.

516
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:25,309
Jane missed appointments
with her case worker.

517
00:27:25,384 --> 00:27:26,442
But she was new.

518
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:27,746
But the Ietter goes on to say,

519
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:30,788
"We recommend that no more
children be placed with her."

520
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:33,518
You felt comfortable
placing three Iittle girls
with this woman?

521
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:36,459
We had her take
a parenting seminar.

522
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:41,358
A seminar?
And she moved back
in with her mother.

523
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:42,491
That was a provision.

524
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,899
Dorothy Rudd
has a Iong history with us.

525
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,200
Still, it was Jane's care
that you put them in.

526
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:50,867
Believe me,
if the BIuebell Agency
had sensed any real danger,

527
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:53,911
they would have taken steps
to have her decertified.

528
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,082
GRANT: We worded that Ietter
very carefully.

529
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:04,953
Phones call out, too. Did you
ever think of reporting Jane
to the state hotline?

530
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:08,481
The violations we had evidence
of weren't that extreme.

531
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,926
The woman's a hopper.
A what?

532
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:16,800
The city contracts out to 73
private foster care agencies.

533
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:18,392
We're not interlinked.

534
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,668
When we turned her down,
she had 72 more chances.

535
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:24,675
And you're sure she's unfit?

536
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:27,041
Yeah, I've been
in this business 20 years.

537
00:28:27,112 --> 00:28:30,138
I interviewed Jane personally.
The woman's not stable.

538
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:33,612
CABOT: We can't go after Jane
based on a case worker's
bad feeling.

539
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:35,482
We have Tanya's
revised statement.

540
00:28:35,554 --> 00:28:37,419
Obtained after Tashandra
took them.

541
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:40,219
They're tainted.
It'II never hold up.

542
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:41,657
We haven't talked to
Dorothy yet.

543
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:43,194
If she turned a blind eye
to the abuse,

544
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:45,627
then she'II protect
the daughter
over the foster son.

545
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:49,633
Then we gotta get to GIenn
now, before she gets
a Iawyer. AIex?

546
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:52,203
There is king for a day.

547
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:54,330
What, another video game?

548
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:56,432
It's where we get
a Iaw guardian appointed
who will play ball.

549
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:00,536
He'II Iet us talk to GIenn,
provided everything the boy
says is off the record.

550
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,275
And any Iaw guardian
will do this?

551
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,977
It might take a Iittle
sweet-talking.

552
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,289
CRAGEN: Hey, GIenn.

553
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:14,925
You know why I'm here?

554
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:21,460
I heard you were the guy
to see about video games.

555
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,829
You ever play Swordquest?

556
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:30,232
That's my game.

557
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,401
Mine, too.

558
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:35,847
I made it to Ievel 13.
Bagged myself a Gorgon.

559
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,485
I hate the Gorgon.

560
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,051
Is that who took Cassie
to the cave that night?

561
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:49,560
No.

562
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:51,628
It was me.

563
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:53,926
Why?

564
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,928
To protect her.

565
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,037
Who was hurting her?

566
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:07,339
GIenn.

567
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:13,048
It's my job to help kids
who have problems
with Gorgons.

568
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,815
You have one in real Iife,
don't you?

569
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:23,927
Who is it?

570
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:31,459
You don't have to worry.
Remember? I'm a Ievel 13er.
She'II never get past me.

571
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,304
What is it, GIenn?

572
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,246
The Gorgon.

573
00:30:47,787 --> 00:30:49,618
What's going on here?

574
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,166
I had no idea what a horrible
influence that video game was.

575
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,725
FIN: Actually,
it's very educational.

576
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:06,601
The monster in it is based on
Greek mythology.

577
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:10,335
A Gorgon, one of three sister
monsters with snakes for hair

578
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:12,934
and the ability to turn anyone
that Iooks at them into stone.

579
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:14,741
Stones can't talk.

580
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:17,282
Why would GIenn
call you a Gorgon?

581
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,511
His imagination.

582
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:25,085
If I'm guilty of anything,
it's of being too protective
of my children.

583
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:26,616
Come again?

584
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:30,458
I know I should have
turned GIenn in
when he first told me.

585
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,359
But he's my son.

586
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:36,901
You're a good mother.

587
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,800
But if you want to help
your son,

588
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:41,339
we have to know
the circumstances
that Ied up to it.

589
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:45,571
You have to understand,
GIenn Iives in a world
of his own creation.

590
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:48,205
FIN: In his mind,
he was rescuing Cassie.

591
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:50,712
Yes.
MUNCH: From what?

592
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,752
What was going on with Cassie
that he felt
she needed rescuing?

593
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:58,654
Cassie is prone to violent
tantrums. She'd been
out of control for two days.

594
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:00,521
Since seeing
her biological mom.

595
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:02,857
When she came back
she was saying
horrible things.

596
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:04,624
I couldn't get her to sleep.

597
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:07,928
When I finally did,
she wet the bed.
Next day, more tantrums.

598
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,992
With hypertension, that kind
of stress can't be good
for your blood pressure.

599
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:15,029
I've taken in 12 children
over the Iast years.

600
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:21,302
They all come damaged. Starved
for Iove and discipline.

601
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,372
You had to discipline Cassie.
We can understand that.

602
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,715
I had to send her
to the "time out" chair.

603
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:29,448
MUNCH: Did you hit her?

604
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:31,580
I spanked her.

605
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:34,021
With what?
My hand.

606
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:40,363
But poor GIenn
always wanted to rescue
a damsel in distress.

607
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:43,129
He was, from being beaten
to death.

608
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:49,673
It was GIenn who killed her.

609
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,772
He must have really knocked
her around when he moved her
over to that house.

610
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:57,545
That's what killed her.

611
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:01,810
The thing is, Cassie had
rope burns on her wrists
and ankles.

612
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:04,924
GIenn didn't tie her up.

613
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:09,989
No.

614
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:13,089
That was Jane.

615
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:19,530
BENSON: Thirteen broken bones.
We know about
the "time out" chair.

616
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:23,533
I told her to be good
or something bad would happen.
I told her.

617
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,204
STABLER: She just wouldn't
Iisten.
No, she was so headstrong.

618
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,442
She was always talking back.
She wouldn't do
as she was told.

619
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:33,008
And, oh,
the incessant questions,
it'd get to anybody.

620
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:35,020
So you tied her up.

621
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:37,352
She couldn't even
fend off the blows.

622
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:41,484
AII Cassie had to do
was be a good girl.
Is that too much to ask?

623
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:44,187
Like you were
when you were Iittle?

624
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:47,131
STABLER: What happened
when you weren't a good girl?

625
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:49,898
She used to do the same things
to you, didn't she?

626
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,337
Well, she wants the perfect
child, obedient and grateful.

627
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,637
She won't accept
anything Iess.

628
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:58,109
Jane, it's still not enough.

629
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,205
She tried to pin
this whole thing on you.

630
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:03,778
No, she didn't.
No, she didn't.

631
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,283
BENSON:
Oh, Jane, yes, she did.

632
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:09,413
We have a signed statement
saying you were the one
that tied Cassie up.

633
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:19,727
My mother made me tie her up.

634
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,166
Jane.
I never hit her, never.
Not once, ever.

635
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,401
But you knew
what was gonna happen.

636
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,070
How could you bring children
into that house?

637
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:34,909
I didn't want to.
I didn't want kids.

638
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:36,312
BENSON: Your mother
made you do that, too?

639
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:39,045
No, she wanted to be
a grandmother.

640
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:45,085
So you took in foster
grandbabies for her to abuse.

641
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,399
Jane, what happened to Cassie?

642
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:56,869
Cassie always fought her.

643
00:34:56,937 --> 00:35:01,306
Told her she hated her,
told her that
she was gonna tell.

644
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:06,609
She said the beatings
were not gonna
keep her quiet anymore.

645
00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:09,647
So my mother

646
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,980
beat her

647
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:15,544
all day Iong.

648
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:25,626
She used her cane, didn't she?

649
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:37,737
Counselor,
I got some more ammunition
for you on the Rudd case.

650
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:40,575
Warner says Dorothy's cane
matches the wound patterns,

651
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:42,114
and we found the rope
in the apartment.

652
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,877
Good. Jane just cut a deal.

653
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,542
Well, not too cherry,
I hope.

654
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,417
Five to ten,
conditional on her testimony
against her mother.

655
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:51,321
She's an accessory,
so her testimony needs
to be corroborated.

656
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:52,824
Well, you got GIenn.

657
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,861
Who's currently
in a psych ward.

658
00:35:54,928 --> 00:35:57,089
Did you guys have any Iuck
tracking down
other foster kids?

659
00:35:57,164 --> 00:36:01,601
Benson and Stabler did
find one. Definitely abused.
He can't face Dorothy.

660
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:05,126
Well, that's one down.
Dorothy's had a dozen
over the years.

661
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,173
Who have scattered to
the four corners of the earth.

662
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,936
Once they turn 18,
the system doesn't
want to know from them.

663
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,672
Good night.
Hey, honest opinion.

664
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:14,976
Can I put GIenn on the stand?

665
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:17,142
Well, I talked to his doctors.

666
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:21,847
He doesn't have any organic
mental illness, but I don't
think he's strong enough.

667
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:23,787
What if I prep the hell
out of him?

668
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,192
Unless you get this kid where
he feels completely safe,

669
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,558
you'II be putting him
at further risk.

670
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:35,825
That's where the judge
will be?

671
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,994
Yeah.

672
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:41,573
You want to try it out?

673
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,314
Now, the courtroom
will be full of people
supporting you.

674
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:52,818
There'II be your Iaw guardian,
and your friend,
Captain Cragen,

675
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:55,753
and I will be at that chair
right there.

676
00:36:57,724 --> 00:36:59,521
Will my mom be here?

677
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:02,256
Dorothy will be at that table
right there,

678
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:05,059
but she can't talk to you
and she can't touch you.

679
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,359
Are you sure?

680
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,468
Do you remember
what the Court Officers do?

681
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:11,299
Keep everybody safe.

682
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,967
Now, the other attorney
is allowed to ask you
questions,

683
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,305
but you just have to answer
them honestly, okay?

684
00:37:17,377 --> 00:37:18,674
Okay.

685
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:26,447
You know, GIenn,
if this is too much for you

686
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,852
or you decide you don't want
to do it, you don't have to.

687
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:32,618
You understand?

688
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:35,024
But it's to help Cassie,
right?

689
00:37:36,263 --> 00:37:37,594
Yeah.

690
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:41,097
Then I want to do it.

691
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:49,875
When did your mom put Cassie
in the yellow chair?

692
00:37:49,943 --> 00:37:51,433
Early in the morning.

693
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,979
And why that chair
in particular?

694
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:55,878
It's for punishment.

695
00:37:58,618 --> 00:38:00,745
What had Cassie done wrong?

696
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:04,955
GIenn, what had Cassie
done wrong?

697
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:09,859
She peed in her bed.

698
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:12,296
What was her punishment?

699
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:14,731
She had to drink
Iots and Iots of water.

700
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:15,825
Until?

701
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:19,736
She wet her pants.

702
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:23,132
Was that the end
of her punishment?

703
00:38:28,214 --> 00:38:29,272
No.

704
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,388
What happened next?

705
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:45,086
She was begging for help.
I needed to save her.
She was...

706
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:47,893
GIenn, just take your time.

707
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:50,959
I needed to help her.
Cassie was hurt.

708
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:56,070
Your Honor, I object to the
blatant ongoing intimidation
tactics by the defendant.

709
00:38:56,143 --> 00:38:58,407
I didn't do anything.
Liar!

710
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:04,578
You beat her.
You beat her the whole day.

711
00:39:04,652 --> 00:39:07,815
I took you in when no one
else wanted you!

712
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:11,080
Cassie was crying,
and you kept hitting her.

713
00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:14,855
She tried to run away
and you made Aunt Jane
tie her down.

714
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:17,894
She was so Iittle.

715
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:21,459
You were supposed
to protect her.

716
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,134
But you beat her
with the cane all day.

717
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:29,772
You killed her.

718
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:34,042
You killed her.

719
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:46,316
Who died?

720
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:49,295
Dorothy Rudd.

721
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:51,528
PIease tell me you're kidding.

722
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,965
Just got a call from Rikers,
massive heart attack.

723
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,831
Bitch didn't even suffer.

724
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,933
CRAGEN:
Anybody else feel cheated?

725
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:01,338
Prosecution abated by death.
It sucks.

726
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,776
That's it. No vindication,
nobody pays.

727
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:07,313
Jane'II do a couple of years.
SIap on the wrist.

728
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:08,609
Her deal is done.

729
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:09,979
What about the foster agency?

730
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,382
They signed Cassie's
death warrant the day
they placed her there.

731
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,284
No Iaws on the books
will Iet me prosecute them

732
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:16,084
even if they knew
the house was unsafe.

733
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:18,091
Tashandra Adams knew.
And you know
what bites the most?

734
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:20,423
She still doesn't have
her kids back.

735
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,060
Of course reunification
is our objective.

736
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:28,431
But she hasn't
met the criteria
of her discharge plan yet.

737
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:31,869
I checked. A Family Court
judge ruled that these kids
could be paroled to Tashandra

738
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:33,463
as soon as she obtained
appropriate housing.

739
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,065
Which she has not done yet.

740
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,973
Part of your obligation
is to help her do that.

741
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:38,807
I know what my job is.

742
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:40,346
And I know mine.

743
00:40:40,414 --> 00:40:43,042
Enforcing criminal sanctions
against agencies Iike yours

744
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:45,108
that knowingly place
their wards in unsafe homes.

745
00:40:45,186 --> 00:40:46,380
I had no idea.

746
00:40:46,454 --> 00:40:50,322
Well, the good people
at the BIuebell Agency
will testify that you did.

747
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:53,385
If Ms. Adams does not get
her children back immediately,

748
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:55,156
I will indict you
for child endangerment.

749
00:40:55,229 --> 00:40:56,491
That's blackmail.

750
00:40:56,564 --> 00:40:58,930
And if you drag your feet,
manslaughter.

751
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,439
Momma.

752
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:13,743
Don't cry. It's okay.

753
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:17,077
Why don't we give them
a Iittle privacy?
Yeah.

754
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:20,382
Can GIenn come Iive here, too?

755
00:41:22,556 --> 00:41:26,720
The boy that tried
to help Cassie,
what's gonna happen to him?

756
00:41:26,794 --> 00:41:29,422
He's in good hands. Bye.

757
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:35,762
What is going to happen
to GIenn?

758
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:37,997
Emergency foster placement.

759
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:40,131
Right back in the system.
