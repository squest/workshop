1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:00,232
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:03,795
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:05,099
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:08,109
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:11,704
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,476
These are their stories,

7
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:21,081
You sure you won't come up?

8
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:23,455
I've got an early session
tomorrow.

9
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:26,051
And after Iast
night, I better get some rest.

10
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,635
Good night.
Good night.

11
00:00:57,894 --> 00:01:00,988
OFFICER: Name's Cassie
Germaine, a cellist with
the Manhattan Symphony.

12
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:04,591
Boyfriend dropped her off
after a date. Perp jumped
her as she came in.

13
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,259
Tore her dress off.
Looks Iike he raped her.

14
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:07,529
Any witnesses?
None.

15
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:08,627
Who called it in?

16
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:10,729
The alarm was triggered
when she didn't
key in the code.

17
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:12,502
Where is she now?
Bedroom.

18
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:13,872
Guy did a number on her.

19
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:20,013
I blacked out. When I woke up,
my head was bleeding

20
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:25,646
and he shredded my clothes
and cut my hair.

21
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,020
Did he say anything?

22
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:29,850
No.

23
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,090
Mind if I show them?

24
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:37,826
I got to get her
to the hospital.

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,424
I'II ride along.

26
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,099
I got something here.

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,269
What's that?

28
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:53,747
See the Iens?

29
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:55,708
STABLER: That's a camera.

30
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:57,810
It's a micro-mini.
Found it in the debris.

31
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:00,578
Somebody watched
the whole thing?

32
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:02,283
Still watching.

33
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:06,852
See, it's wired into the Iamp.
Drawing juice off
the apartment electrical.

34
00:02:58,414 --> 00:02:59,506
Find any more cameras?

35
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:00,742
Not yet.

36
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,449
What's that gizmo?

37
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:03,746
It's an RF scanner.

38
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:07,252
Each camera transmits
on its own assigned frequency.

39
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:10,751
I'm picking something up here.
Hold this for me.

40
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,424
That's a good angle
for you, Morales.

41
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:22,829
What have you got?

42
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,536
Focused on the bed.

43
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,678
I've got hangnails
bigger than this thing.

44
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,337
FIN: Found another one.

45
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,043
Bird's-eye view
of the toilet and shower.

46
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:37,278
How many is that?

47
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:40,151
Four so far.
One in the Iiving room,
two in the bedroom, and this.

48
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:42,157
We've got ourselves
a high-tech peeping Tom.

49
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,419
Where's he peeping from?

50
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:45,790
Hard to say.
These cameras
use wireless transmitters.

51
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:48,557
With no hard Iine to trace,
he could be next door
or on the next block.

52
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:50,189
What kind of range
we talking about?

53
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,996
150, 300 yards,
depending on signal strength.

54
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,563
Well, that narrows our search
to a couple of thousand
apartments and offices.

55
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:08,747
Excuse me. They told me
you were all set in here.

56
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:09,978
I'm done.
Great.

57
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:11,781
You're free to go.
Thanks.

58
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,253
Thanks, Doc.

59
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:15,881
You ready to go home?

60
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,947
Yeah.

61
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:20,956
My boyfriend grabbed
a few things for me to wear.

62
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:22,926
You get the results
of the rape kit yet?

63
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:25,160
The swabs were negative
for seminal fluid,

64
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:28,761
no vaginal Iacerations,
but that's not unusual.

65
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,296
So was I raped?

66
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,701
Don't know that for sure yet.

67
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:37,337
But the fact that he cut
your hair and your clothes,
wrote on your body,

68
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:40,507
does tell us that it was
a sexually-motivated assault.

69
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:46,418
Cassie,
can you think of anybody
that might want to hurt you?

70
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:48,114
No.

71
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,627
Do you remember anything?
A voice? A smell?
Color of his shoes?

72
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:56,693
No. It all happened so fast.
I didn't see or hear anything.

73
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,227
Who else has the keys
to your apartment?

74
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:01,793
Nobody. Why?

75
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:07,169
We found cameras
hidden in your Iiving room,

76
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,303
your bedroom and your bath.

77
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:12,640
Somebody's been watching me?

78
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,216
How Iong?

79
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:18,480
We're not sure yet.

80
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:22,253
Is it the same guy
that attacked me?

81
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:24,919
It could be. That's what
we're trying to find out.

82
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:27,588
But I promise you,
we have swept
your entire apartment.

83
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:30,632
We found all of the cameras...
Where's my boyfriend?

84
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,635
He's outside.
He's waiting to take you home.

85
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:37,696
I don't think
it'II ever be Iike home again.

86
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,667
You go straight home?

87
00:05:39,742 --> 00:05:42,768
Wait a minute. You don't think
I did this, do you?

88
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,938
Because whoever hid those
cameras was spying on me, too.

89
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:48,973
Look. You know,
I'm just trying to get
a handle on what happened.

90
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:50,412
How about friends
and co-workers?

91
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:51,544
She mention
any problems with them?

92
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,349
Yes. Only one.

93
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:55,151
Robert Prescott,
our conductor.

94
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:57,522
He's been after her
since she joined the symphony.

95
00:05:57,593 --> 00:05:58,855
And when was that?

96
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:00,395
About six months ago.

97
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:03,091
Cassie said she set him
straight, but I'm not so sure.

98
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:04,189
Yeah? Why?

99
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,530
Because Prescott has a hard
time taking no for an answer.

100
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,536
You can ask Valerie Baxter.

101
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:09,730
I will. Who is she?

102
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:12,399
The violinist he was involved
with Iast season.

103
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:14,534
Rumor is he was abusive.

104
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,271
And what does this have to do
with Cassie?

105
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:19,712
Because about a month
after Valerie Ieft,
Prescott hired Cassie

106
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:22,649
and turned her into
his Iittle pet project.

107
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:25,448
Even went so far as to set her
up in Valerie's old apartment.

108
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,920
He set her up?

109
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:28,786
The bastard owns the place.

110
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:32,327
AII that rage
and he didn't rape her?

111
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:33,760
Maybe he didn't
have the chance.

112
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:37,458
Unis were there five minutes
after the security company
reported the alarm.

113
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,761
How's the boyfriend Iook?

114
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,893
Checked him out.
He was in a cab
during the attack.

115
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,062
And the conductor?

116
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:44,868
Well, according
to the building manager,

117
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,636
Cassie's apartment is owned
by Maestro Productions,
Incorporated.

118
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,109
AKA, Robert Prescott.

119
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,373
And the previous tenant
was a violinist
he was involved with.

120
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:54,007
She moved out
when the relationship
allegedly turned abusive.

121
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,711
Think the cameras were there
when Cassie moved in?

122
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:59,016
Prescott had ample opportunity
to plant them.

123
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:00,680
Any history between
him and Cassie?

124
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,986
Boyfriend says Prescott's
been chasing her for months.

125
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:05,083
Maybe he got tired
of being a couch potato.

126
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:08,028
Maybe he hired someone
to spice up his Iittle show.

127
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,327
Either way, this guy meant
to humiliate her.

128
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,630
He wrote "whore"
across her chest,
Iopped off all her hair.

129
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,795
And took a fistful with him
to relive the moment.

130
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,463
What did Prescott have to say?

131
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,202
Nothing yet. Secretary
says that he ducked out
early this morning

132
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:22,210
to Iook at investment
property upstate.

133
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:23,267
How convenient.

134
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:24,835
Won't be back
until Iate tonight.

135
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:27,144
Well, where does a guy
get this video hardware?

136
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:30,583
The Iab tracked
the serial numbers
to a shop on 35th and Third

137
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:31,915
called Quark International.

138
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:34,683
Everything for the novice spy
under one roof.

139
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:37,988
Just Iocated his
ex-girlfriend, Valerie Baxter.

140
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,391
New York School of Music.

141
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:43,922
Talk to her. She might be
able to fill in some details
until Prescott gets back.

142
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,637
He said I have a gift, but I
needed to Iearn discipline.

143
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,833
So he took you under his wing.

144
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:55,638
We'd work Iate together,
into the night.

145
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:58,236
He'd drill me
until my fingers bled.

146
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,941
Sounds demanding.

147
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:03,050
He was. But it worked.

148
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:07,753
I was feeling the music
on a deeper Ievel
than I ever thought possible.

149
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:10,451
When did the relationship
turn sexual?

150
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:16,921
About a month after we started
private sessions.

151
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:23,961
He made me feel special,
that I could become
a concert violinist.

152
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,430
We hear that he was abusive.

153
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,443
Not until I told him
I wanted out.

154
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,001
STABLER: What happened?

155
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:38,945
One night, after he'd fallen
asleep, I went to the closet
for an extra blanket.

156
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:46,392
I found a video camera
aimed through a hole
in the wall.

157
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,330
The red Iight
was still blinking.

158
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:54,934
On the shelf,
there was a row of tapes
with women's names.

159
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:59,302
I was just another chapter
in his tape collection.

160
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:01,839
So how did he react
when you ended it?

161
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:03,970
He turned vicious.

162
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,514
He berated me,
and threatened me.

163
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:11,052
I couldn't pick up
my violin without shaking.

164
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:15,516
We carry a full Iine
of surveillance
and security technology

165
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:18,492
for the discerning
professional
and private citizen.

166
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:22,156
Five hundred channels
and this is the crap
they put on?

167
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,290
Guess where the camera is.

168
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:27,065
I give up.

169
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:33,272
CT 30-59.
It's got a half-inch CCD chip,
auto-iris Iens,

170
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:36,641
and, with no front
element exposure,
it's virtually undetectable.

171
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:37,770
What about this?

172
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:41,247
A TRX-40 Iistening device
with digital recorder
and telephone interface.

173
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,375
This stuff's Iegal?

174
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,113
Absolutely. Since 9/11,
it's been flying off
the shelves.

175
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:48,156
Into whose hot Iittle hands
did these gems fly?

176
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:50,418
Three CT 30-10s,

177
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:56,691
30-57
and a Spymaster-4 receiver.
That's some serious equipment.

178
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,733
FIN: How serious?
Couple thou.

179
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,098
MUNCH: Cash or credit?

180
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,194
Good old American plastic.

181
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:05,398
The equipment was ordered
online and charged to a credit
card issued Iast month

182
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,840
to Mr. Herman Garfunkle
in Queens.

183
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,640
Imagine our surprise
when the Iovely Mrs. Garfunkle
told us

184
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:14,149
that her dearly departed died
three years ago
from a heart attack.

185
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:15,581
Well, who took delivery?

186
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:18,484
A PO box at U-Mail-It,
63rd and Broadway.

187
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:20,715
Paid for with Garfunkle's
credit card.

188
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,053
Within walking distance
to Cassie's apartment.

189
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,025
And Prescott's penthouse,
two blocks from there.

190
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,824
Within transmission range
of the cameras.

191
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:29,897
We need to get inside
his penthouse.

192
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:31,660
We don't have enough
for a warrant.

193
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,599
What about Valerie's
statement?

194
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,500
He videotaped her
without her consent.

195
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:39,371
It's not a crime if she
willingly engaged in those
activities while in his house.

196
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:41,932
She didn't have a reasonable
expectation of privacy?

197
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:45,708
The issue isn't
the government's intrusion
into our right to privacy,

198
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:48,773
it's the right of a private
citizen to keep the government
out of his bedroom,

199
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:50,751
and the courts still view that
as sacrosanct.

200
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,548
We're not talking about
his bedroom.

201
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:54,646
If he planted those cameras
in Cassie's apartment,

202
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:55,985
it's as good as
breaking and entering.

203
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:58,856
Not necessarily. He owns
the apartment.

204
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,326
He has certain rights
to entry.

205
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:03,763
AIex, we are talking about
a predator who's using
his position

206
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,630
to extract sexual favors
and terrorize women.

207
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,363
What if we found those cameras
in your bathroom?

208
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:10,268
CRAGEN:
He may have taped the attack.

209
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:13,206
We need a Iegitimate reason
to search his apartment.

210
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:17,909
Okay. But you have to Iimit
the warrant to the receiver

211
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,448
and any videos
or video equipment.

212
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:35,425
EIIiot. Camera's aimed
right at the bed.

213
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:38,193
Maestro's been very busy.

214
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,167
Here's Valerie's performance.

215
00:11:41,336 --> 00:11:43,600
Cassie's peepshow
can be any one of those.

216
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:44,696
When's Prescott due back?

217
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:46,900
Secretary said tomorrow
morning.

218
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,671
Looks Iike we have
a Iong night ahead of us.

219
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:54,437
When Valerie said a row
of tapes, I had no idea
she meant three dozen.

220
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,013
I've totally Iost count.
Where are we?

221
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:59,816
Tape number nine.
No, number ten.

222
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:06,426
He really seems to favor
that one position there.

223
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:08,360
At Ieast he's consistent.

224
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,625
"Boring" is the word
I think you're Iooking for.

225
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,189
FIN: Wait till you see this.

226
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,599
BENSON: What you got?
More romping around?

227
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,741
STABLER:
Will you Iook at that?

228
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,434
BENSON: It's Cassie.

229
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,978
MUNCH: In the flesh.

230
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:26,640
Time code says
this was recorded Iast month.

231
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:29,206
Apparently, our victim's been
keeping a few secrets.

232
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:30,581
Why didn't she tell us?

233
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:31,778
Maybe she was embarrassed.

234
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,287
FIN: Or afraid to.

235
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:35,585
I guess the maestro
wants her to know who's boss.

236
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:38,182
Let's just get them
both in here. Different times,
different rooms.

237
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,455
Find out what the hell's
going on.

238
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,800
BENSON: It's time to start
telling the truth, Cassie.

239
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,531
I told you the truth. I don't
remember anything else.

240
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:52,199
We're talking about
you and Prescott.

241
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:55,441
We found a videotape
of you two.

242
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,500
Where?

243
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:57,875
In his bedroom.

244
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:59,846
Why didn't you tell us?

245
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,379
He threatened
to ruin my career.

246
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:05,249
I think we need to start
at the beginning.

247
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:11,088
I met Robert
about eight months ago
at the Casals Competition.

248
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:15,920
When I won, he offered
to bring me to New York.

249
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:17,431
Was sex part of the deal?

250
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:18,488
No.

251
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:22,900
He placed me with
the best instructors.

252
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,996
He introduced me
to all the right people.

253
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:28,174
He even set up my debut.

254
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:30,939
Whenever I needed him,
he was there.

255
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:35,177
I guess I fell in Iove.

256
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,775
When did the relationship
turn sour?

257
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:43,449
One night, I stopped by
his apartment to surprise him
with a birthday gift.

258
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:46,893
He was in bed
with another woman.

259
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,497
I told him it was over,
that I was quitting
the orchestra.

260
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,296
Wasn't about to
Iet that happen.

261
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:57,202
He said he'd
invested too much in me
and then he showed me the tape

262
00:13:57,272 --> 00:13:57,241
and threatened to show it to
all his friends in
the business if I didn't stay.

263
00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:00,938
I said I'd press charges
and he said, "Go ahead."

264
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:02,274
It would be his word
against mine.

265
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:03,644
How Iong ago was this?

266
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:04,875
A Iittle over a month.

267
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,974
Has he threatened you since?

268
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,075
Not exactly.

269
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:09,643
What exactly does
"not exactly" mean?

270
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:13,518
I've been getting phone calls
and flowers.

271
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:15,985
Yeah? What kind of flowers?
What's that?

272
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:20,225
After every concert,
I come home and they're
waiting for me at my door.

273
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:23,665
AII the card ever says is,
"AII my Iove, Me."

274
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,364
And the phone calls?

275
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:29,737
The minute
I walk into my apartment,
my phone starts ringing.

276
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:32,003
When I answer, he hangs up.

277
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:35,171
I thought it was Robert
trying to intimidate me.

278
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:39,341
Cassie, how do you think
he knows when to call?

279
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:45,746
He's watching me
with those cameras.

280
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,126
I know he's cruel. I never
thought that he'd hurt me.

281
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,860
Do you remember
the name of the florist?

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,365
Farrelly's.

283
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:57,696
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

284
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,938
Prescott's here
with his Iawyer.

285
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:05,206
Okay. We'II take him
in Interrogation.

286
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:07,507
You and Munch,
can you give Cassie
a Iift back to rehearsal?

287
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:09,069
No problem.

288
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:13,215
That's quite
a video collection you've got,
Mr. Prescott.

289
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,981
Private acts between
consenting adults.

290
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:19,349
They consent
to being taped?

291
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:21,182
Of course.

292
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,454
STABLER: Not according to
Valerie Baxter.

293
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:27,194
In case you hadn't noticed,
Valerie is a very fragile
young Iady.

294
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:28,562
Thanks to you.

295
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:31,693
Valerie had visions
of stardom.
I tried to help her.

296
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,069
There was only
so much I could do
with the raw material.

297
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,971
And you did it
every which way you could.

298
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:38,600
Careful, Detective.

299
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:41,976
I assure you, Detective,
a good time was had by all.

300
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,439
BENSON: You having a good time
with Cassie Germaine?

301
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:45,983
I'm enjoying working with her.

302
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:48,281
She is a very talented
young Iady.

303
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:49,843
Now, you own her apartment.

304
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:52,981
It is a tax write-off for
my Ioan-out company.

305
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:56,585
I rent it at a Ioss
to visiting musicians
and new hires.

306
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:00,961
I also sublet apartments
on West 66th and 69th Street.

307
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,757
You put cameras in them, too?

308
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:05,894
STABLER: Not to mention
sending her flowers
and Iove notes.

309
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:08,667
I don't know
what you're talking about.

310
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:10,632
Where were you
night before Iast?

311
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,200
Are you insinuating
that I had something to do
with her attack?

312
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:14,302
Did you?

313
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:18,475
I am producing her New York
debut this Friday.

314
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,882
I am going to make
a big star of her.

315
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,785
Why would I want to hurt her?

316
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,118
Because she told you
to get Iost.

317
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:28,819
And we all know how well
you handle rejection.

318
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:32,021
You didn't answer
our question. Where were you?

319
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:35,123
As a matter of fact,
I was with a young Iady.

320
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,191
We need a name.

321
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,802
Since you already
have the tapes,
you already have the answer.

322
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:47,975
Her name is on the Iast tape.

323
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:50,913
It's time-coded
and it's dated.

324
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,581
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

325
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:56,013
EIIiot?

326
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:04,658
That guy's a piece of work.

327
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,459
Munch and Fin called
from the concert hall.

328
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:09,022
There's been another attack.

329
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:15,996
Just walked in,
heard the scream
all the way from the Iobby.

330
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:17,132
What had happened?

331
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,369
They came back from a break,
found a message for Cassie.

332
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:20,433
What kind of message?

333
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:22,343
See for yourself.

334
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:26,648
FIN: It was stuck between
the strings.

335
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:28,151
Looks Iike
it's written in blood.

336
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:30,147
BENSON: Whose blood?

337
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:39,455
Where's Benson?

338
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:41,624
She's staying with Cassie
until her friend shows.

339
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,189
Anything on your flower man?

340
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,031
Store clerk remembered
the guy.

341
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:47,469
Said he never gave a name,
always paid cash.

342
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,665
Description?

343
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,574
White, medium height,
blond scraggly hair,
medium build.

344
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:54,076
I set her up
with a sketch artist.

345
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:56,705
I still say Prescott could
have hired somebody.

346
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:57,907
No, I don't think so.

347
00:17:57,982 --> 00:18:00,109
The attacks were too personal
for a surrogate.

348
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:03,018
The cards,
the flowers, the cello.

349
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:04,214
These are intimate gestures.

350
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:05,381
Unfortunately,
we've eliminated

351
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:06,583
the only two men
she's been involved with.

352
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:08,751
Maybe it's an erotomanic.

353
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:11,955
He believes that
he's in a relationship
that doesn't exist.

354
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,658
Sounds Iike me
and my four ex-wives.

355
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,164
He might not even be
in the orchestra.

356
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:17,667
She might not even know him.

357
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:19,464
What flipped his switch?

358
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:22,062
A Iook, a smile,
a casual hello.

359
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:24,475
But to him, it's the beginning
of a beautiful Iove affair.

360
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:27,534
Reminds me of a case
a few years back.
A guy thought this newscaster

361
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:29,773
was sending him secret signals
through the television set.

362
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:30,872
What happened?

363
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:34,350
Well, he followed her home
one night, she told him
to get Iost, and he shot her.

364
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:38,048
So, if our guy was Iooking in
while she made Iove
to her boyfriend...

365
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:40,023
"Love, Me" turns to
"Die, Bitch."

366
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:41,615
He might not stop
until he kills her.

367
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:43,524
So where do we find
this straggly-haired freak?

368
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:46,894
Probably somewhere near
the receiver that picked up
the video signal.

369
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:48,865
Where are the tech guys
on the door-to-door?

370
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:51,663
SIow-going without warrants.
They've got thousands
of square feet to cover.

371
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:54,000
I'II ask the squad commander
to double the sweep teams.

372
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:56,006
Meanwhile, what's the purchase
date on the equipment?

373
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:58,042
Third of Iast month.
AII right.

374
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:01,476
Focus on anybody in and out
of her apartment
between then and now.

375
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:04,606
This guy had to be
in Cassie's apartment
to plant the cameras.

376
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:06,411
I want to find out how.

377
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:12,448
The entire building
got a security overhaul
in January,

378
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:15,459
so each apartment's
got its own alarm
and security code,

379
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:18,052
so nobody's getting in
without the tenant's
permission.

380
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:19,756
What about maintenance?

381
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,799
We always give prior
information about that,

382
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,629
so that way,
if the tenant can't be home,

383
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,033
then I stay in the apartment
until the work is done.

384
00:19:26,104 --> 00:19:27,594
Now, that's policy.

385
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:30,505
Any visits
to Cassie Germaine's
apartment in the Iast month?

386
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:34,773
Yeah. Here we go. 304.
The plumber unclogged
a kitchen drain.

387
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:37,576
That was on Tuesday.
And there was a security tech

388
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:40,413
that came up to her apartment
to check on
the new alarm system.

389
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:41,577
That was on the 8th.

390
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:42,881
How Iong was he up there for?

391
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:44,819
An hour, I guess.

392
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,314
You guess?

393
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:49,121
Turns out I had
a Iittle problem
with the heating system in 102

394
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:51,162
about the same time.

395
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:52,491
So much for policy, huh?

396
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,759
I can give you
the tech's name.

397
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,823
It's right on the work order.

398
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:58,368
Ray Campbell.

399
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:03,702
Ever since 9/11,
it's been boom time
in the security business.

400
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,710
Had to hire a slew
of new guys.
Some good, some not.

401
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:09,508
Which is why we got to go back
and shake out the bugs
every now and again.

402
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:11,048
How Iong has Ray
been with you?

403
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:13,413
About 10 years.
He's one of my best men.

404
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:17,386
Well, apparently, he made
a follow-up call to
Cassie Germaine's apartment.

405
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:20,117
Do you know what the problem
was with her alarm system?

406
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,658
I don't remember.

407
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:23,057
But then again,
we've been so damn busy.

408
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:24,219
Yeah.

409
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:28,264
That's odd.

410
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:30,261
Looks Iike the work order's
not in the system,

411
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,168
and I have Ray
at another Iocation that day.

412
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:34,637
Nearby?

413
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:35,798
Next block.

414
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:37,231
Where's Ray now?

415
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:38,297
He's out on a job.

416
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:40,344
I'd Iike to talk to him.

417
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:43,244
Ray Campbell?
Yeah?

418
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:44,975
Detective Stabler.

419
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,042
What can I do for you?

420
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:52,215
Well, the 8th of Iast month,
did you do a job
at 262 West 65th Street?

421
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,882
I work a Iot of jobs
in that area.

422
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,119
Well, how about this job?

423
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:01,065
Yeah. No. I mean no.

424
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:02,258
Which is it?

425
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,198
Look, I installed a system
there a few months ago,

426
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,828
but I ain't been
back there since.

427
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:08,269
Is that your employee number?

428
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,398
Yeah. But that is not
my signature.

429
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:12,136
Well, whose is it?

430
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:16,577
Well, maybe it's the same guy
who stole
the rest of my stuff.

431
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:18,714
What stuff?

432
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:21,445
About a month ago,
somebody broke into my truck.

433
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,511
Took some tools, jacket, hat.

434
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,550
I didn't even think
to check the paperwork.

435
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,958
I mean, why the hell
would anybody
want that, right?

436
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:34,424
He posed as a security tech
to gain access
to the buildings.

437
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:37,491
Now, only three addresses
serviced by that company

438
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:40,162
fall within the broadcast
range of the cameras.

439
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:41,865
One of them
in Cassie's building.

440
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,100
And a tech just finished
sweeping that.

441
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:47,110
Which means the receiver
has to be in one of
the other two buildings.

442
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:49,510
I got the managers to fax me
their work orders.

443
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,810
Take a Iook at the signatures
on the bottom there.

444
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:52,907
They don't match.

445
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:56,215
One's a forgery.
Signature's the same
as the phony work order

446
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:59,745
from Cassie's building,
and it includes a charge

447
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:02,292
for an unauthorized DSL Iine
in the basement.

448
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,385
He could send out
a video signal over that.

449
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:05,554
Munch and Fin are with a tech.

450
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,394
Have them get over
to that second building now.

451
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:14,797
Why do we always get stuck
with the glamorous gigs?

452
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:17,602
Because Cragen Iikes
our can-do attitude.

453
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:19,902
Yeah. If I wanted to go
crawling through dark,
smelly places,

454
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:21,842
I would have joined
the Department of Sanitation.

455
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:23,642
Guys, over here.

456
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:24,841
FIN: What's that?

457
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:29,216
Looks Iike a
telephone junction box, and
that's probably a DSL Iine.

458
00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:32,085
MUNCH: Like what hooks
my computer up
to the World Wide Web.

459
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:34,590
MORALES: Can you give me
a hand here, please?

460
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,527
There's your receiver,
connected to a Iaptop,

461
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:40,791
and those four outputs
correspond
to the four cameras.

462
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:42,730
And what's that Iaptop for?

463
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,427
It's probably running
a video-streaming program

464
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:46,333
and transmitting
the pictures over this.

465
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:48,964
FIN: To where?
Anywhere he can
plug in another computer.

466
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,975
You mean
he's sending his video out
over the Internet?

467
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:54,307
Welcome
to the information age.

468
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:56,813
Turns out our perp's
hosting his own website.

469
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:59,408
Picked up a video signal
using a receiver Iocated in
a building on the next block

470
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:03,319
and then sent it out over
a DSL Iine charged
to the security company.

471
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:04,822
How many hits to the website?

472
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,552
According to
the Internet service provider,
a Iot of hits,

473
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:09,184
but only one computer
doing the hitting.

474
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:10,353
Whose is it?

475
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:13,796
It's a guy named
Terry Willard. 23rd and Lex.

476
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:19,361
Terry Willard?
New York City detectives.
Open up.

477
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:21,633
He's not in any trouble,
is he?

478
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:25,006
This is a warrant.
Could you open that door,
please?

479
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:37,752
Would you stand to the side,
please?

480
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:40,024
FIN: Any idea where Terry is?

481
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,185
AIMEE: Probably at work.
What did he do?

482
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,094
BENSON: It's just part
of the investigation.

483
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:54,102
You got a key for this?

484
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:55,197
No.

485
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:01,804
Guys, check this out.

486
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:11,953
Now that's devotion.

487
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:15,255
He's almost finished
with another roll.

488
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:17,761
More pics to add
to his collection.

489
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:21,156
Indiana University, 1997.

490
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,530
He's been stalking her
since then.

491
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:26,126
FIN: Talk about your groupie
from hell.

492
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,831
And Terry's her number
one fan.

493
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:36,205
We'II bring the computer
back to the Iab

494
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,647
and see what Morales
gets off the hard drive.

495
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:41,049
Check the DVDs, too.
He might have recorded
the attack.

496
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:43,246
Yeah. We'II clean up here.

497
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,560
He's a good man.
Sweet, gentle.

498
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:51,788
You seem to know him
pretty well.

499
00:24:51,864 --> 00:24:53,491
We've become quite close.

500
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:55,065
How close?

501
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,395
He's my boyfriend.

502
00:24:58,537 --> 00:24:59,697
Since when?

503
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:00,760
Thanksgiving.

504
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,964
Neither one of us
has family here,

505
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,942
so I suggested we go to
a coffee shop on the corner.

506
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:08,279
That was our first date.

507
00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:10,842
You ever been in that room?

508
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,817
It's his office.
There was never any reason.

509
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,713
He ever talk to you
about a friend of his
named Cassie?

510
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:18,312
Maybe from college?

511
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,291
He doesn't have many friends.
He's too busy with work.

512
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,918
What kind of work does he do?

513
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:25,520
He's a partner at an
Internet company in SoHo.

514
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:28,623
It's really taking off,
which is why his hours
are so crazy.

515
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,860
STABLER: What's the name
of the company?

516
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:31,061
Webtrends.

517
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:35,095
His office is in one of those
big, glass buildings
by the river.

518
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:37,366
We Iaid Terry off
a couple of months ago.

519
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:39,342
So he's not a partner?

520
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:41,743
Hardly. Terry's not really
a people person.

521
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:44,077
But he's
a hell of a website designer.

522
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:45,480
So then why Iet him go?

523
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:48,918
We had to dump 90%
of our people
when the stock tanked.

524
00:25:48,987 --> 00:25:53,390
A few months back, all these
cubicles were filled with
designers and support staff.

525
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:56,018
Now we're flirting
with Chapter 11.

526
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:58,629
Well, this was Terry's
workspace.

527
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,889
He went ballistic
when we gave him the bad news.

528
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:02,228
He have a temper?

529
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:05,759
That's the thing.
He was so quiet,
you forget he was even here.

530
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:08,533
The Iast few weeks
he seemed distracted.

531
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:09,665
Yeah? Over what?

532
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,776
Probably heard the rumors.

533
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:14,744
We would have kept him on,
but his work habits
became so erratic.

534
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:16,678
I mean, he Ieft us no choice.

535
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:17,806
STABLER: Erratic? How?

536
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:19,475
Missed days at a time.

537
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,883
He'd come in all bleary-eyed
Iike he'd been up all night.

538
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:25,151
I guess when the ax
finally dropped, he snapped.

539
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:30,452
MORALES: These four images are
a composite from the hardware
in Terry's apartment.

540
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:31,826
FIN: How'd he do it?

541
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:34,297
He downloads the images
from all four cameras
into his computer,

542
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:37,665
where he edits the video
and transfers it to a DVD.

543
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:39,064
His director's cut.

544
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:41,571
He's finished 20 days,
complete with music.

545
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,870
Is this the day of the attack?

546
00:26:45,544 --> 00:26:48,377
Yeah. This is the morning,
still unedited.

547
00:26:48,513 --> 00:26:50,743
MUNCH: Fast-forward
to that night.

548
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:56,784
That's where he blitzed her.

549
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:01,119
MORALES: Door was shut.
Lost all the Iight.

550
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:04,486
Sorry. You might be
interested in this, though.

551
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:09,894
"The Legend of
Cassie and Terry."

552
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:13,734
An online journal.
Love story begins
four years ago at Indiana U.

553
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:15,329
Hears her playing the cello.

554
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:17,238
Must have struck a chord.

555
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,209
Follows her to competitions
all over the world,

556
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:21,711
but the story takes a sad turn
when Terry goes to prison.

557
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,804
For what?

558
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:26,044
Credit card fraud
to pay for the trips.
Does a seven-month stretch.

559
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:29,383
But by the time he gets out,
Cassie's graduated
and moved away.

560
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:31,945
So he contacts
an online search engine,

561
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,219
buys her social security
number for 45 bucks,

562
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:36,556
and uses it to trace her
work address to the Symphony.

563
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:39,324
FIN: Any fool can do it.
AII you need is a computer
and an Internet hook-up.

564
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:42,333
Yeah, but is there anything
in this journal
that ties him to the attack?

565
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,767
Nothing that
makes him the doer.
No Ieads on his whereabouts.

566
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:46,827
Girlfriend hasn't
heard from him for two days,

567
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:48,202
so he knows
we Iike him for this.

568
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:49,900
MUNCH: Lucky he's
still in town.

569
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:51,704
And we know that how?

570
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:54,905
He has a half-dozen
online accounts,
all under fictitious names.

571
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,312
Uses public computers
in coffee shops

572
00:27:57,382 --> 00:28:00,647
and bookstores up and down
Broadway to visit his sites.

573
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:03,244
We told Morales
to keep the sites
and the credit card active

574
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:05,289
so we could track
his movement.

575
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:08,622
If he ever stays online
Iong enough, the service
provider can trace the hit.

576
00:28:08,694 --> 00:28:10,252
And if he doesn't?

577
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:12,057
Well, he's under our radar.

578
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,995
Unless we can flush him out.

579
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:17,866
Tell Benson and Stabler
to bring in Cassie
for a Iittle chat.

580
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:20,998
CASSIE: That's him?

581
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:22,370
It's a four-year-old mug shot.

582
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:24,033
His appearance
may have changed.

583
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:26,669
He followed you here
from college.

584
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:29,043
Why?
BENSON:
He's obsessed with you.

585
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:32,379
But I don't know him.
I've never seen him before.

586
00:28:32,451 --> 00:28:34,180
HUANG: He thinks he knows you.

587
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:37,983
He's concocted a whole story
in his head about your
having a Iove affair.

588
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:41,514
The cameras were a way of
furthering that delusion
without risking rejection.

589
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:42,685
How do you know?

590
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:45,229
He kept a journal
with intimate details

591
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,992
of a four-year relationship
between you two.

592
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:49,465
How can he be jealous
when I've never met him?

593
00:28:49,534 --> 00:28:51,331
That's part of his sickness.

594
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:53,564
He believes that
the two of you are in Iove.

595
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:55,765
Well, isn't there any way
to stop him?

596
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:58,242
We think so, but we're going
to need your help.

597
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:01,474
Now, Terry visits a website
he dedicated to you

598
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:04,038
twice, sometimes
three times a day.

599
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,509
Well, what would I have to do?

600
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:10,716
We'd Iike you to include
a message to him
in your press interviews.

601
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,489
Dedicate the performance
to him.

602
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,356
Tell him it's your way
of Ietting him know
how much he means to you.

603
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:17,020
But this guy is crazy.

604
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:21,192
We'II cover every entrance,
we'II grab him before
he ever gets close to you.

605
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:23,929
You haven't caught him yet.
Why should I trust you now?

606
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:27,905
Cassie, this is our best
chance of getting him
into a controlled situation

607
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,134
on our terms.

608
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,802
But we can't do it
unless you agree.

609
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:01,203
MORALES:
We've got a camera positioned

610
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:03,469
at each entrance
to the auditorium.

611
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:06,011
They're hooked up
to the facial recognition
software,

612
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:08,103
which is Ioaded into
this computer.

613
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,944
I didn't know
we could afford this stuff.

614
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,143
Well, as each person passes
through the choke point,

615
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:14,379
the camera takes a series
of still shots of their face.

616
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:18,514
The software scans that face,
and compares it to
known felons in a data bank.

617
00:30:18,591 --> 00:30:21,856
Could be a busy night.
These theater folks
are a motley crew.

618
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:25,056
Well, for today, I've entered
only one face into the bank.
Terry Willard.

CRAGEN:
What if he's disguised?

620
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:28,156
Well, we've Iowered
the recognition threshold

621
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:31,203
to allow for differences
between his mug shot
and his current appearance,

622
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,172
including changes
in facial hair, glasses,
weight Ioss and gain.

623
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:37,869
Technology's answer
to racial profiling.

624
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:39,969
And Big Brother's new toy.

(BEEPING)

626
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,241
What do you got?
A hit.

627
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,619
Aisle two. The man
in the beard, behind the woman
in the red dress.

628
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:55,256
Sir, come with us, please.

00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,493
MORALES: Hold on. We've got
another hit. Aisle four.

630
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:01,192
MUNCH: How many Terry Willards
are out there?

631
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:03,428
There might be a few.
I set a Iow threshold.

632
00:31:03,502 --> 00:31:06,130
Go ahead.
I'II wait for the next one.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

634
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:18,015
I can't do this.

635
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,381
We're checking everyone.

636
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:21,283
If he's here,
we're going to get him.

637
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:23,754
Don't worry. Just think
about the music, okay?

638
00:31:23,823 --> 00:31:26,053
I'II be in the front row.

639
00:31:26,158 --> 00:31:28,023
You're going to be great.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

641
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:48,105
Sorry for the inconvenience.

642
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,543
False alarm.
Same here.

643
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:53,414
So much for Big Brother.

644
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:56,011
Detectives. Found these
outside the dressing room.

645
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:58,579
They're addressed
to Miss Germaine.

STABLER: A dead rat.

649
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:05,895
How the hell
did he get in here?

650
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:07,856
Go ahead.

651
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:12,032
Where? AII right, we got it.

652
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,093
What?

653
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:14,161
Another hit.

654
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:29,587
Excuse me, sir.
I want you to come with me.

655
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,282
No.
Sir, I want you
to come with me.

656
00:32:31,357 --> 00:32:32,449
No.
Sir.

657
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,726
Leave me alone.
She invited me.

658
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:37,456
Cassie invited me.

659
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:42,132
There's no one Iike Cassie.

660
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:44,465
Now, you guys don't seem
to run in the same circles.

661
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:45,834
How did you meet?

662
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:48,203
I was taking a shortcut
through the school of music

663
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:50,174
when I heard someone playing.

664
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:51,704
The cello?

665
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,211
I moved to the open door
and I saw her, alone,
on stage.

666
00:32:54,281 --> 00:32:56,272
I stood there Iistening,
and when she finished,

667
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,047
she Iooked up and saw me,
and then she smiled.

668
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,144
Connected.

669
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,190
From then on,
I knew we'd be together
for the rest of our Iives.

670
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:06,157
But it hasn't always
been easy.

671
00:33:06,226 --> 00:33:09,923
I mean, the traveling,
prison, the dead-end jobs.

672
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:12,022
You've sacrificed a Iot
to be with her.

673
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,567
Not a sacrifice
if you care about somebody.

674
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:16,864
Well, what he means,
it must have cut awfully deep

675
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:19,405
to watch her making Iove
to another man.

676
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,302
It wasn't her fault.

677
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:23,466
How do you figure that?

678
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,704
He got her drunk
and took advantage of her.

679
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,077
Come on, Terry.
I know you Iove her,
but you're not an idiot.

680
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:30,241
She knew you were watching
and she Iaughed in your face.

681
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:31,784
No. It wasn't Iike that.

682
00:33:31,852 --> 00:33:34,446
He makes those sacrifices,
she treats him Iike
he's yesterday's trash.

683
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,682
I'd want to slap
the hell out of her, too!

684
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:38,588
I'd never hurt Cassie.

685
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:42,651
I Iove her. It was horrible,
the way he beat her.

686
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:49,935
How did you know
she was beaten?

687
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:52,028
I saw it.

688
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:55,472
With the cameras you put
in her bedroom to spy on her?

689
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:00,013
I found her website
on the Internet.

690
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,176
You were just surfing the web
and you happened
to come across her website?

691
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,275
I don't think so.

692
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:07,252
Terry, we know about
your Iittle scam
with the credit cards.

693
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,151
We know you bought
the cameras.

694
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:12,191
What about the cello? The rat?

695
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,563
I don't know
what you're talking about.

696
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:19,496
Why are you running, Terry?

697
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:22,126
Aimee said you were
trying to put me in jail
for something I didn't do.

698
00:34:22,202 --> 00:34:24,397
Aimee, your other girlfriend?

699
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,772
She's not my girlfriend.
She's my Iandlady.

700
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:29,899
CRAGEN:
That's not what she said.

701
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:31,000
Then she's Iying.

702
00:34:31,078 --> 00:34:32,636
Well, you know something,
Terry? I think you're Iying.

703
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,441
You're playing her 'cause
you can't pay your rent,

704
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:36,311
and you're playing us because
you think we're stupid.

705
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:37,407
No!

706
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:39,884
Hey, we can't help you
unless you help yourself!

707
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:44,151
Tell us the truth, and maybe
I can convince the D.A.
to go easy on you.

708
00:34:44,224 --> 00:34:46,692
If not, it's out of our hands.

709
00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:52,824
I've already told you
the truth. I'd never hurt her.

710
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:56,729
Never.

711
00:34:58,572 --> 00:35:01,336
We don't have any evidence
tying him to the assault
or the vandalism.

712
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:02,875
No forensics. No witnesses.

713
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:04,240
What about the cameras?

714
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,903
He used a phony
credit card to buy them.

715
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,607
We still can't prove
it was Terry who used
the card to make the purchase.

716
00:35:08,682 --> 00:35:10,843
His fingerprints
were in Cassie's apartment.

717
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:12,384
AII right. Trespassing.

718
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:14,545
Counselor, he stalked her.

719
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,187
Stalking requires proof
he tried to frighten her.

720
00:35:17,257 --> 00:35:19,657
AII of our evidence shows
he tried to remain hidden.

721
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:22,820
In fact, Cassie hadn't even
seen him until you arrested
Terry at the concert.

722
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:24,796
Well, what about
that case in Jersey?

723
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:28,028
Landlord got 30 years
for planting cameras
in a tenant's apartment.

724
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:29,693
He transmitted sound.

725
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:31,794
That elevated the charges
to wiretapping.

726
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:33,999
Terry did not record
or transmit sound.

727
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:35,063
So where does that Ieave us?

728
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,700
Since you found the clothing
from the security company
in his apartment,

729
00:35:37,777 --> 00:35:40,211
I can try and up the ante
to burglary of the van.

730
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,577
That it?

731
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:45,744
Till the Iaw catches up with
the technology, I'm afraid
that's all I can do.

732
00:35:47,954 --> 00:35:50,388
At Ieast we pulled the plug
out of Terry's
Iittle operation.

733
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:53,984
I read somewhere that once
an image gets on the Internet,
it can never be destroyed.

734
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,255
A hell of a way to achieve
immortality.

735
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:59,958
I just got a call from Cabot.
Aimee posted Terry's bail.

736
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,661
He's in jail for planting
cameras in another woman's
apartment

737
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:04,260
and she comes to his rescue?

738
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:05,668
How blind can Iove be?

739
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:08,105
I'm going to get
a uni on Cassie.
I don't trust this guy.

740
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:09,836
CRAGEN: Too Iate.

741
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:14,242
Cassie Germaine's been shot.

742
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,182
WOMAN ON PA: Dr, Thomas,
call the pharmacy, Dr, Thomas,
please call the pharmacy,

743
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:22,016
How's she doing?

744
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:23,715
Still in surgery.
What happened?

745
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,851
She came by to pick me up
on the way to work, and I'd
forgotten my wallet inside

746
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:30,260
and I'd just opened my door
and I heard shots

747
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,264
and I ran back out there
and I found her Iying there.

748
00:36:32,332 --> 00:36:33,560
Kevin Wilson?

749
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:34,725
Yes.

750
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:36,860
Hi. I'm Dr. Barrett,
Cassie's surgeon.

751
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:38,165
Is she going to be okay?

752
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,865
It Iooks good.
She was very Iucky.

753
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,498
Can we speak with you
one second, Doc?

754
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,669
Sure.
Hold on. So fill us in.

755
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,076
Two slugs to the back.
One hit the Ieft kidney,

756
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:48,444
the other barely
missed her heart.

757
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:50,642
Excuse me.
Any idea what caliber?

758
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:55,086
Small. Maybe a.22.
And, given the stippling,
I'd say it was close range.

759
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:56,452
When do you think
we can talk to her?

760
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:58,218
Soon as she's out of recovery.

761
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,383
Okay.

762
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:03,785
That was Munch.
Internet service provider
got a hit on Terry's website.

00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:06,832
Where?
Internet cafe
two blocks from here.

764
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:08,660
Okay. Why don't you go ahead?

765
00:37:08,735 --> 00:37:10,703
I'II stay with Cassie,
see if she can make an ID.

766
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,139
He's still online.

767
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:20,907
AII right. Well, Iet's go.

768
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:39,457
John.

769
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,106
Enjoying the show?

770
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:52,906
I'm not doing anything here.

771
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,971
Aren't you a Iittle young
to be watching that?

772
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:57,573
A guy was sitting here, okay?

773
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,175
He Ieft his computer on,
so I decided to check it out.

774
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:00,776
What guy?

775
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,222
He had scraggly hair.
He was sort of wigged out.

776
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:07,886
He was blubbering about
some chick Ieft him over
another man or something.

777
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:10,054
Is this the guy?
Yeah.

778
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,290
Where'd he go?

779
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:13,127
Took off about 10 minutes ago.

780
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,394
CIerk says our guy Ieft this.

781
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:17,292
Aimee SIocum.

782
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,667
Either she's the dumbest woman
in the world,

783
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,296
or he's a Iot slicker
than he Iooks.

784
00:38:20,373 --> 00:38:22,603
STABLER: Don't you have
some homework to do?

785
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:24,868
He can't get far without cash.

786
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:26,002
Unless someone's helping him.

787
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,944
Aimee.
She keeps bailing him out.

788
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,140
Why don't you sit on her?

789
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:33,015
I'II hook up with OIivia,
see if she got anywhere
with Cassie.

790
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:35,314
MUNCH: Aimee?

791
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:38,152
I'm in kind of a hurry.

792
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:40,385
I'm making dinner
for a friend in Brooklyn.

793
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,586
Want us to give you a Iift?

794
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:42,923
I have a cab waiting.

795
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:44,623
We're Iooking for Terry.

796
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:47,531
He hasn't been home
since he got out of jail.

797
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,329
How did he get this?

798
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:51,497
Where did you find that?

799
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:53,540
At an Internet cafe
where he was visiting
his favorite website.

800
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:55,632
You know,
Cassie's Greatest Hits.

801
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,644
There must be
some kind of mistake.

802
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:00,112
Someone shot Cassie
this morning.

803
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:04,017
Not Terry.
He's the gentlest man I know.

804
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:06,576
We just want to make sure
he doesn't hurt you.

805
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,019
You've got him all wrong,
Detective.

806
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:09,920
If you hear from him,
you'II Iet us know, right?

807
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,153
I will. Now if you'II
excuse me, I'm Iate.

808
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:17,188
Do you believe
that song and dance
about a friend in Brooklyn?

809
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:18,754
Hell, no.
Let's tail her.

810
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:26,469
I was waiting in the garage
for Kevin and I felt a sharp
pain in my back. That's...

811
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:29,166
My Iegs buckled.

812
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,074
BENSON: Did you see anybody?

813
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,636
No. By the time I Iooked up,
he was gone.

814
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,341
Okay. We've posted
a uniformed officer outside,

815
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,009
so no one's coming in.

816
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,485
Detectives?

817
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,016
AII these are for her?

818
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,115
What the card says.

819
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:46,420
Hold on.

820
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,258
"Together forever.
Love, Me." Where is he?

821
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,460
Delivery guy
just dropped them off.

822
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:56,800
Hey, hey. Stop.

823
00:39:56,871 --> 00:39:57,929
What did I do?

824
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:01,202
AII right. Let me see some ID.
Who sent the flowers?

825
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:02,264
Not a clue. I just deliver.

826
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:03,367
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

827
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:04,706
Benson.

828
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:05,768
Girlfriend's on the move.

829
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:08,610
She's changed cabs twice,
rode all over hell and back.

830
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:11,651
Finally Ianded at some dive
in Spanish Harlem.

831
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,016
I'd make book on it.

832
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:14,384
She's in Room 602.

833
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:15,945
We got the hotel room.

834
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:24,223
That's the room.
I'II take the fire escape
in case Terry bolts.

835
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:26,163
I'II take the alley.

836
00:40:29,904 --> 00:40:32,805
Aimee, it's Detective Benson.

837
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:34,101
Go away.

838
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,304
Aimee, we're not
going anywhere.

839
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:38,640
Now open up the door.

840
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:56,623
Aimee, where's Terry?

841
00:40:56,697 --> 00:40:57,857
He's gone.

842
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:00,957
Why are you still here?

843
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:02,593
I had to take a shower.

844
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:09,773
I was going to take him home
to Oklahoma,
so we could make a new Iife.

845
00:41:10,377 --> 00:41:13,869
But Terry wouldn't
Ieave that whore.

846
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,710
You mean Cassie?

847
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:20,717
I warned her
to Ieave him alone.

848
00:41:21,622 --> 00:41:24,523
So you attacked her.
You cut her hair.

849
00:41:25,092 --> 00:41:27,117
Well, she wouldn't Iisten.

850
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:29,320
So you shot her.

851
00:41:29,497 --> 00:41:32,022
I had to stop her.

852
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,090
I'm the only one
who really Ioves him.

853
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,993
BENSON: Hell of a way
to show it.

854
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:48,841
I didn't know what else to do.
She has so many men.

855
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:52,179
Terry is all that I have.
