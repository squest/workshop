1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:00,602
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,197
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:05,399
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:08,376
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:12,005
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:14,072
These are their stories,

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,245
Syd.

8
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:23,851
Syd.

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,392
Oh, this isn't gonna work.

10
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:35,429
Syd.

11
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:40,474
Oh, what...

12
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:42,369
What the hell are you doing?

13
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,505
If you want me to stay,
this is not gonna be...

14
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:46,639
Syd.

15
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:50,451
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:54,848
Where's Dr. Warner?
Melinda's at an ME conference,

17
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,755
so you're stuck with me
till the end of the week.

18
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:58,987
So what's on the menu
for today, Justin?

19
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:02,998
Looks Iike
autoerotic asphyxiation.
Sydney Green, early 30s.

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,824
Husband found her.
STABLER: And he is where?

21
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:10,202
He was flipping out.
So the unis drove him
to your precinct.

22
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,132
We cut her down?
Husband did.

23
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,835
Said he turned off
the music, too.

24
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,104
Dead how Iong?

25
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:17,772
Rigor was just setting,
so three, four hours tops.

26
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:19,508
Okay. Any fluids?

27
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,944
None apparent, but I don't
expect to find any.

28
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:23,918
Autoerotics Iike to fly solo.

29
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:26,079
Is that why you're Ieaning
toward accidental death?

30
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:29,784
Skin pics, plus the sex toys
and the mirror. It's a gimme.

31
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:31,626
But it's not official
till I cut her open.

32
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:34,254
Well, until then, Iet's work
it as a sexual homicide.

33
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,094
Female asphyxial deaths
are on the rise
across the country.

34
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,861
If that's what this one was.

35
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,061
I'II Iet you know.

36
00:01:42,638 --> 00:01:44,572
No sign of a break-in
or a struggle.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,303
The candles, the music,
that strikes me as
a seductive scene.

38
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:50,743
Maybe she wanted
to treat herself.

39
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:54,579
Most women don't go this far,
but they do Iike to
self-serve.

40
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,177
STABLER: I guess you want
something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

41
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:47,734
How Iong has your wife
been asphyxiating?

42
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:48,861
No, that's crazy.

43
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:51,338
Look, Sydney had never done
anything Iike that before.

44
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:53,637
She's not that kind of person.

45
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:55,843
And how Iong were you married?

46
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,004
Six months.

47
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:00,705
We were having problems.

48
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,616
We decided to separate.

49
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:05,847
How Iong were you together
before you got married?

50
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:08,117
Just a few months.

51
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,886
That's quick.

52
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,950
That's why we separated.

53
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,792
Look, I...

54
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,326
It's only been a couple of
weeks. I just went over
to get a few things,

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,460
and that's when I found her
Iike that.

56
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:22,663
Where were you before that?

57
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,170
Working. I'm an artist.
I have a Ioft
over in AIphabet City.

58
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:32,078
And how come
you two weren't getting along?

59
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,483
Irreconcilable differences.

60
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:38,042
STABLER: What does that mean?
Cheating?
No.

61
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:41,951
Look, just 'cause two people
Iove each other doesn't mean
they can Iive together.

62
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:43,855
Why? Why are you asking me
these questions?

63
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:45,223
I mean,
somebody killed my wife.

64
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:46,488
Who wanted the divorce?

65
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:50,259
We hadn't decided to file,
but I wanted the separation.

66
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,690
We got married too fast.

67
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,634
So then it is possible
that your wife hid
her sexual practices from you.

68
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,867
Our sex Iife wasn't
the problem. When... Can I...

69
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:04,908
Do you know when
you'II release my wife's body?

70
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:07,310
We'II Iet you know.

71
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:14,213
Any alarm bells going off
on the husband?

72
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,484
Several.
He's hiding something.

73
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:18,459
Getting off while choking
isn't something you share
with friends and family.

74
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:20,654
People are always shocked
when they get
that kind of news.

75
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,391
I still think the victim
was entertaining.

76
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:25,457
She had a new man,
or hubby got there
earlier than he said.

77
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:27,229
Well, if she had a partner,
it's manslaughter,

78
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:29,635
whether the ME rules it
an accident or not.

79
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:33,072
Did the victim have
any visitors
besides the husband?

80
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:38,236
The visitors' Iog Iisted
a Pam Adler and Amelia Chase,
arrived around Iunchtime.

81
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:39,872
Pam Adler,
the criminal attorney?

82
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,974
Yeah. Rose, Adler & KIein.

83
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:45,020
She cross-examined me
on a drug bust
where a cop got killed.

84
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,577
Accused me
of police brutality.

85
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:48,521
Don't tell me the perp
went to the hospital.

86
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:51,424
Drug dealer's still alive,
the cop isn't.

87
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,557
We'II take the Iawyer since
Fin's got history.

88
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,858
Go.

89
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:01,494
It's terrible. Did she suffer?

90
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:04,128
STABLER: We really
can't answer that.
Were you two close friends?

91
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:06,800
Yes. We met at Vassar.

92
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:11,169
We had our whole Iives
ahead of us.

93
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,178
And now she's dead.

94
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:19,588
I just can't stop thinking
about her. First the divorce
and now this.

95
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,751
We heard it was
a trial separation.

96
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:24,793
Six-month-old marriage
and nothing but fights.

97
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,853
Sydney couldn't take it
anymore, so she called
an attorney I know.

98
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,523
Have you seen Sydney recently?

99
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:33,124
She was supposed to meet
Amelia and me for Iunch.

100
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:36,433
When she didn't show,
we went over to her apartment.

101
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:41,204
Sydney said that she
wanted to be alone,
but I think she had company.

102
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:42,839
What made you think that?

103
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:44,106
She had on a robe.

104
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,140
Candles were burning,
music was playing, and
the bedroom door was closed.

105
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,585
Do you have any idea
who might have been with her?

106
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:57,422
No. The divorce was hitting
her hard. She was depressed.
Andrew was no prize.

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,889
STABLER: You don't Iike him?

108
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:04,323
He's an artist
with questionable talent
who married a meal ticket.

109
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:07,794
They met on
a Caribbean vacation.

110
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,101
AIthough where
the Iittle bastard got
the money, I'II never know.

111
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,607
I at Ieast convinced Syd
to sign a prenup.

112
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:16,736
Is there anything else
that you can tell us
about her husband?

113
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:20,407
Is there something
I should know?
Are you thinking foul play?

114
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:24,943
Cause of death is still
pending so the Iaw says
we treat it as a homicide.

115
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:29,523
What you know about the Iaw
I could fit
in the palm of my hand.

116
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,222
How much was Mrs. Green worth?

117
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:33,886
I don't have a clue.

118
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:38,627
But call her divorce attorney,
he should have
a complete Iist of her assets.

119
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:42,828
Thanks for waiting. This was
sudden, just a tragedy.

120
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:44,634
What was Sydney Green's
financial status?

121
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:47,574
She made a killing
in junk bonds but Iost
her shirt in the tech market.

122
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:48,632
There's nothing Ieft?

123
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:51,578
Apartment's mortgaged,
Iife insurance
will cover her debts.

124
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,638
The husband
might clear 50 grand.

125
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:54,978
That's still a Iot of money.

126
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,608
In Manhattan? Don't kid me.

127
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:58,983
Would he have walked away
empty-handed
had your client Iived?

128
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:02,285
Absolutely. There was a prenup
and tax returns show
a Ioss after they married.

129
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,986
Was Andrew Green aware of his
wife's financial situation?

130
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,790
She handled the money,
so I don't see how.

131
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,956
Her secretary said
she should be done by now.

132
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:13,229
These day traders
Iive pretty good,
short hours, spa days.

133
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,701
What the hell
is she doing in there?

134
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,169
Beauty treatments take time.

135
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:19,605
Mud bath,
cellulite dissipation,
an exfoliating facial.

136
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:22,473
Time and money, some women
Iearn early how to waste both.

137
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:24,035
Your ex-wives made you bitter.

138
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:25,774
Not bitter, just resigned.

139
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:28,078
The receptionist said
the police
were Iooking for me.

140
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,242
You the detectives?

141
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:32,185
Yeah, we'd Iike to talk to you
about Sydney Green.

142
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:35,417
I still have
some errands to run.
Do you mind if we walk?

143
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:36,981
How well did you know her?

144
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,788
I met Sydney at OIdman.

145
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:41,261
She made a fortune in junk
and got out early.

146
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,491
Kept her toe in trading
for herself.

147
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:46,797
We remained friends, although
she was a Iittle too risque
for my taste.

148
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,598
Can you get more specific?

149
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,935
I'm not interested
in titillating you, Detective.

150
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:52,906
And we're not here
to carry your bags.

151
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:54,567
Just speak up and we're gone.

152
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:55,837
I don't understand.

153
00:07:55,911 --> 00:08:00,109
I mean, when Pam gave me
the news, I just naturally
thought it was an accident.

154
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:01,809
Why would you assume that?

155
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,078
I mean, she Iived on the edge.

156
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:05,450
That's how she worked,
how she Iived,
a big risk-taker.

157
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:07,079
Was she an adrenaline junkie?

158
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:08,384
Nothing that extreme.

159
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:12,291
But, you know, she got a rush
from gambling,
risky stocks, kinky sex.

160
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,658
What kind of kinky sex?

161
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,253
Like Iooping ropes
around the neck.

162
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:16,423
Sick stuff Iike that.

163
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,558
I mean,
she even tried to sell me,
but I wasn't buying.

164
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:21,467
MUNCH: Doesn't sound Iike
you had much in common.

165
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:23,266
You know, in some ways
we were kindred spirits.

166
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,670
How so?

167
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,571
There aren't too many women
in our business.

168
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,109
And we both Iike
to make Iots of money

169
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:31,578
and show up the entitled men
while we were doing it.

170
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:35,113
Amelia Chase said
our victim was a choker.

171
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:37,516
Were they close enough for
such an intimate confidence?

172
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:41,181
Supposed to be kindred sisters
fighting male dominance
in the market.

173
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:44,784
Yeah. They were so close
she seemed real broken up
by her friend's death.

174
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,192
You think she or the Iawyer
had anything to do with it?

175
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:49,857
Last people to see her alive,
but what's the motive?

176
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:50,956
How does the husband Iook?

177
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,022
STABLER: Pretty strong.

178
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:53,295
He's got a negative
bank balance,

179
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,769
and his credit report shows
Iots of bad debt write-off.

180
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:57,271
The wife cut
the purse strings?

181
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,704
She may not have had a choice.

182
00:08:58,774 --> 00:08:59,763
She was broke, too.

183
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,275
Why kill her?

184
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:02,810
Fifty grand's
better than nothing.

185
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,436
Would that cover his debt?

186
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:06,003
BENSON: And then some.

187
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,178
Have we heard
from the ME's office yet?

188
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,274
FIN: Not yet.

189
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:12,013
AII right, well,
Iet's get down to the morgue,
Iean on the Assistant ME.

190
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:14,419
We gotta know. Check with
Green's neighbors, all right?

191
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,479
Find out how he's Iiving.

192
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:19,153
If he still Iooks good,
bring him in
for a hard interview.

193
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:22,395
You were drowning in bills.
Did you kill her
for the money?

194
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:24,159
Money? There was no money.
We were broke.

195
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:26,724
But you stand to inherit
50 grand from her death.
That's plenty.

196
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:28,565
BENSON: You said
that she never choked.

197
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:30,537
You said that she wasn't
that kind of person.

198
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:32,904
But somebody else tells
a completely different story,

199
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:34,442
that she did it all the time.

200
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,307
Okay, which is it,
murder or accident?

201
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:38,312
Now, if she choked,
then you either knew about it

202
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,472
or you killed her outright.

203
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:42,711
In that case, you're gonna
do some time yourself.

204
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:48,618
Andrew, the system
will go a Iot easier on you
if it was an accident.

205
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,625
But you need
to tell us the truth.

206
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:02,697
We told everyone
we met on the islands,
but we really met in rehab.

207
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,636
We just didn't want
anybody to know.

208
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:05,833
STABLER: Which rehab facility?

209
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:07,034
NarcAnon.

210
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,568
Addiction to painkillers.

211
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:11,373
We already knew the worst
about each other.

212
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:14,109
I would've stood by her side
through anything.

213
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:17,914
If she would only come clean,
maybe she'd still be alive.

214
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:20,087
Came clean about what?

215
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:23,613
Sydney was using drugs again,
Iosing control.

216
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,418
She had a bachelor party,
and she and her friends

217
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:31,660
attacked the male stripper.

218
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,258
Was it reported to the police?

219
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:34,359
Yeah.

220
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:38,570
They were waiting for us on
our doorstep when we
returned from our honeymoon.

221
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:40,404
BENSON: How badly
was this guy hurt?

222
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:41,807
They raped him.

223
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,806
That's why we were fighting.

224
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,709
If somebody killed my wife,

225
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:51,682
it was probably him.

226
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:05,160
Excuse me.
Looking for Peter Smith.

227
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:09,103
Is this about...
Yeah.

228
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:13,637
I'm gonna take a break.
I won't be Iong.

229
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:18,078
So, did you find out the names
of the other women
who raped me?

230
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:21,239
Do you know a woman
named Sydney Green?

231
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:23,284
You know I do.
Have you been
in contact with her?

232
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:24,842
Have you seen her
since the alleged rape?

233
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,080
AIIeged?

234
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:29,386
No, I haven't seen her
or talked to her since she
and her friends attacked me.

235
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,483
You sure about that? I mean,
I show your photo around

236
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,461
and somebody from her building
IDs you, I'm not gonna
be so pleasant.

237
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,125
Listen,
you're not here to help me,
so what's this about?

238
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,331
Sydney Green is dead.

239
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,630
And you think I killed her?

240
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,332
You had a reason.

241
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:46,567
Cops treated me Iike dirt.
They made fun of me,

242
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,837
brought me to the hospital,
told the nurse it was a scam.

243
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:52,210
I've got reason to be angry,
but I didn't kill anyone.

244
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,647
We need an account
of your movements
two days ago.

245
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:57,185
I was at the animal shelter
until Iate evening.

246
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:59,243
Check with my supervisor.

247
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:04,820
Sydney Green's building
has security. If he did it,
how did he get in?

248
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:08,690
MUNCH: So, what's the verdict?

249
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:10,493
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

250
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:12,625
She tightened the rope
around her neck, Iike so,

251
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,398
and using an arm to support
her weight on the bed,
she Ieaned at a slight angle.

252
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:19,236
But she miscalculated,
Iost control and passed out.

253
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:21,503
Her body goes slack
and acts as a counterweight.

254
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:23,738
We call it
gentle strangulation.

255
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:24,938
That's comforting.

256
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:27,944
STABLER: We sure this is
an accidental death?

257
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:31,008
The Assistant ME's convinced.
He played it out
and it Iooked good to me.

258
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:33,919
We don't have a suspect.
Peter's alibi panned out.

259
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:36,514
No sign of a struggle.
No sign of a break-in.

260
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:37,718
Do you want this
to be a homicide?

261
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:38,987
I...

262
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:41,387
I don't know,
but something's off.

263
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:44,227
You can always take it up
with Warner when she gets back
from her conference,

264
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,164
since you got so much
free time.

265
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,430
Fine. Officially it's closed.

266
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:51,200
Not quite. We still have
an open rape case.

267
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:53,265
No.

268
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,068
I already talked to Cragen
who already spoke with Cabot,

269
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:59,546
and she'd Iike to see us
in her office, so, yeah.

270
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:02,876
STABLER: Was he drugged?

271
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,009
CABOT: He doesn't need to be.

272
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,644
Was there even a weapon?

273
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:06,745
None Iisted.

274
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:10,219
Happened at
the bachelorette party.
Mob attack isn't unheard of.

275
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:13,022
CABOT: Did the uniforms
follow up on
the suspect's complaint?

276
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,029
They asked a few questions,
and then they dropped it.

277
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:16,997
Because they didn't buy it
and neither do I.

278
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:18,760
And more importantly,
neither will a jury.

279
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:21,826
Well,
if the attack took place,
I'II make sure that they do.

280
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:25,271
First male rape victim
with female perps, that adds
up to a Iot of attention,

281
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,398
doesn't it, Counselor?

282
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:28,067
I am not interested in that.

283
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:29,667
He is the first man
to come forward.

284
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:32,578
The statute for rape one
was changed in January,
Detective.

285
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:35,378
What about his inability
to complete the act
against his will?

286
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,418
An erection is
a physical response, EIIiot.

287
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:38,851
If he was aroused,
he consented.

288
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,513
Well, the Iaw disagrees
with you.

289
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:42,420
So interview the victim
and get his statement.

290
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:44,516
Well, it was your predecessor
who declined to prosecute.

291
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:48,290
So maybe you should find out
why before we chase our tails.

292
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:52,298
The alleged victim,
Peter Smith,
works as a male stripper.

293
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:56,531
His shtick is dressing as
a motorcycle cop with a badge
covering the family jewels.

294
00:13:56,605 --> 00:13:58,835
One of the party guests
took photos. Check the file.

295
00:13:58,907 --> 00:13:57,238
So you decided
not to prosecute

296
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:59,243
because you disapprove
of the victim's profession?

297
00:13:59,311 --> 00:14:00,505
Get off the soapbox, AIex.

298
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:03,707
The guy claimed three women
cuffed him to the bed
and had a party.

299
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:05,682
The bride claimed he was a pro
Iooking to score.

300
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,218
Did Peter Smith have
a solicitation history?
No.

301
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:09,617
Well, then why didn't you
pursue it?

302
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:12,248
I'm not wasting taxpayer money
on a no-win.

303
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:15,384
He just wasn't believable.
Even his Iive-in girlfriend
wasn't buying.

304
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,655
The defense calls her
as a witness,
there goes the case.

305
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:20,425
So the victim reports
the crime, and you just
Ieave him twisting.

306
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:23,695
If you want to jeopardize
your standing on
a flimsy trial, be my guest.

307
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:25,633
Okay. I need your notes.

308
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:26,898
Done.

309
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:28,462
You clear this with Villani?

310
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,873
I don't have to. Sex crimes
is my purview. See you.

311
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:34,907
Peter and I broke up
a Iong time ago,

312
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,948
and I wasn't at the party.
So what can I tell you?

313
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:38,812
We're just Iooking for some
background. That's all.

314
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,408
You don't believe Peter
was raped, do you?

315
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:41,474
Join the club.

316
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,043
What makes you think
that he wasn't?

317
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:45,954
He's a guy. Men don't
get raped by women.

318
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,589
Men can be victimized.

319
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,786
Sure.
When I first met Peter,

320
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:52,557
he was being kept by some
woman 12 years older than him.

321
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:55,532
She was paying for his tuition
at NYU Drama.

322
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,591
His parents are well off.
Why wouldn't they support him?

323
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:58,795
Because his father said

324
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,634
he wasn't gonna shell out
25 grand a year
for a drama degree.

325
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:02,934
Can't say I blame him.

326
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:05,340
What do you think your ex's
motive is for coming forward?

327
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,676
Attention. Peter cheated on me
with a casting director
to get a part in a play.

328
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,545
He'II do whatever it takes
to get ahead.

329
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:15,347
Making an accusation of rape
is pretty drastic,
don't you think?

330
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,682
It's not gonna be
easy for him.

331
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:19,019
The tabloids will pay
big money for the story.

332
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,218
Interviews on talk shows,
pundit commentary on
the evening news.

333
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:24,694
He probably thinks
it's worth it.

334
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:27,755
Doesn't prove anything,
EIIiot.

335
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,163
Except maybe we should
keep digging.

336
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,600
Why? Because she told you
what you wanted to hear?

337
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,470
It's not our job
to judge the victims.
That's up to the jury.

338
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,603
I can give you an assessment
of your rape victim,

339
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:39,610
but bear in mind,
I haven't examined him yet.

340
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:43,978
How did Peter Smith
Iet three women
get the better of him?

341
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:46,774
The guy works out.
He takes care of himself.

342
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,876
And yet you tell women
not to fight back.

343
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:50,080
That's different.

344
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,213
Why?

345
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:54,615
Because he's a man.

346
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:56,684
Because he's stronger.
He can overpower them.

347
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:58,524
Men are taught differently.

348
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:02,896
You know, "Oh, it hurts,
but don't cry. Be a man.
Internalize the pain."

349
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,198
Does the victim
have any siblings?

350
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,999
Three sisters.
There you go.

351
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:09,666
A Iifetime of instruction
on how to treat women.

352
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:13,438
Never hit a female.
No manhandling.
If you're angry, walk away.

353
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:18,471
Yeah, but if he felt trapped,
if they attacked him,
it's self-defense.

354
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,177
Why not just fight back?

355
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:23,084
Because he had no control
over the situation.

356
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:28,353
His self-esteem
and his pride were violated.

357
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:33,161
I wouldn't be surprised
if there were more
male victims out there.

358
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,631
Female rage
is a growth industry.

359
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:38,568
The price of equality.

360
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:41,970
STABLER:
Are you still a stripper?

361
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,507
No.

362
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:48,612
Not since the rape.
I used to book birthdays
and private parties.

363
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:50,644
It Ieft me free to audition
during the day.

364
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:51,739
BENSON: So you're an actor.

365
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:53,147
I gave it up.

366
00:16:55,253 --> 00:17:00,452
Okay, so you show up
in your cop outfit.

367
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:03,953
Why don't you just run us
through what happened?

368
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:07,698
I got there Iate. There were
about 30 women or so,

369
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:12,095
pretty sauced and hungry
for entertainment.
I danced for them.

370
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,001
Did you have anything
to eat or drink?

371
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:15,198
Soda.

372
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,834
I asked the bride-to-be
for my payment.

373
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,968
She said to follow her,
the checkbook
was in her office.

374
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:24,448
Did you feel different
after that drink, you know,
Iike you'd been drugged?

375
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:26,006
Should I have been?

376
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:27,847
Do you need a reason
why this happened to me?

377
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,649
Why I wasn't man enough
to protect myself? Would
that make you feel better?

378
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:31,882
Peter.

379
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:36,190
What happened then?

380
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,024
We get to the room,
but it was dark.

381
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:40,462
She made her way to the desk
and turned the Iamp on.

382
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:43,831
It was a spare bedroom,
and two other women
were waiting.

383
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:45,392
Did they call
each other by name?

384
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,770
No. One of them had
a Ietter opener.
She tried to stab me.

385
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:54,574
The other two
were pulling me back.
They cuffed me to the bedpost.

386
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:59,043
I started yelling, but Sydney
turned the stereo on Ioud.

387
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:03,317
Then what?

388
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:17,598
They yanked my pants off
and tossed them.

389
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,594
Underwear, too.

390
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:26,336
I didn't want to,

391
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:29,639
but my body...

392
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:34,112
I can't explain it.

393
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:36,210
Arousal does not mean consent.

394
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:40,483
And rapists use the body's
response against the victims
to mess with their head,

395
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,220
to make them believe
that they were asking for it.

396
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,125
Does this type of thing happen
to women, too?

397
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:47,130
Yeah. It happens a Iot.

398
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,767
What about the other guests?
Where were they?

399
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:55,773
Still partying,
until Sydney Ieft the room.
I guess she cleared the place.

400
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,603
Did you ever say no?

401
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:01,704
I yelled it. I screamed it.

402
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:05,311
I even threatened
to go to the police.

403
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:08,750
One cold bitch said
that what I knew about the Iaw

404
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,414
wouldn't fit
in the palm of her hand.

405
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:18,886
Pam Adler was in that bedroom.

406
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:22,228
Which means Amelia Chase
is probably the third member
of this rape troika.

407
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,268
I'm not so sure
he's being entirely candid.

408
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:25,495
He was raped, EIIiot.

409
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,265
He's an actor. He's trained
to make us believe.

410
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:30,466
Three women at the same time,
most guys would
call that Iucky.

411
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:34,706
So we're saying that men
are sex hounds and only women
can feel violated?

412
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:35,871
That's gender bias.

413
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:37,938
Most women don't report rapes.
What's his angle?

414
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:40,450
We can't ask that question.
Wouldn't ask a female victim.

415
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:42,509
We question female victims
all the time.

416
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:45,055
CRAGEN: This pans out,
the press is gonna
feed on this guy Iike carrion.

417
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:46,215
And maybe that's the point.

418
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,350
Front page splash,
this guy's an instant star.

419
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:50,360
You think that he's doing this
for the fame?

420
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:52,293
Some people
will do anything for it.

421
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:54,422
CRAGEN: Doesn't matter.
He's a complaining witness.

422
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:57,366
So bring in Adler and Chase
and do a Iineup.

423
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:03,206
You can't come in here.

424
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:05,265
FIN:
Consider the market closed.

425
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:09,006
I can't talk now, Detectives.
But if you'd Iike to wait
in reception...

426
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,672
No. No. No. No.
Not you, KIaus.

427
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:13,342
Deutsch marks are up
three points. Will it hold?

428
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:15,511
We need you down
at the precinct, Miss Chase.

429
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,111
I'II call you back, KIaus.

430
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:18,621
When?
Now.

431
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,658
For what reason?
FIN: A Iineup.

432
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:22,317
Am I under arrest?

433
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:23,655
MUNCH:
Depends on what happens.

434
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,158
Then I'm not coming with you.

435
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,595
That's fine, but when
we come back to get you,

436
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,326
it's gonna be midday
on the trading-room floor.

437
00:20:33,972 --> 00:20:36,167
Remember,
Iet me do all the talking.

438
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:39,142
Don't react to anything
that's being said about you.

439
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,609
Put your poker face on.
You got it?

440
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:43,146
Counselor, good afternoon.

441
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,406
I'm due in court,
so whatever it is
it's just gonna have to wait.

442
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:47,815
I don't think so.

443
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:48,909
What's this about?

444
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:50,955
Rape in the First Degree.

445
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:52,353
You're not serious.

446
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,224
Ask for a continuance.
If not, get Bob down here
to sit first chair.

447
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:02,694
Shall we?

448
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:06,895
Carolyn Maddox.

449
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,370
AIexandra Cabot
for the People.

450
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:11,272
So I've read.
People v, Hightower,

451
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:15,335
You Iost due to shaky evidence
and the inexperience
of a rookie.

452
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:17,940
Defense counsel of record
was Pamela Adler.

453
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:20,177
I hope this isn't petulance,
Counselor.

454
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:23,015
Your main concern should be
the Iineup, Miss Maddox.

455
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,555
Good.
You didn't jump for the bait.

456
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:29,081
I think you'II make
a formidable opponent.
Let's do it.

457
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,203
Number three.

458
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:47,369
BENSON: Are you sure?

459
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,637
Take your time.

460
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:54,140
"What I know about the Iaw,"
remember?

461
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,946
I'm positive, number three.

462
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,921
That's two for two.

463
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:02,717
Read Miss Adler her rights.

464
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:09,997
Looks Iike we're gonna be
famous. See you in court.

465
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:19,368
"File numbers 434, 546 and 47.

466
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:22,038
"Rape in the First Degree.
Sodomy in the First Degree.

467
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:24,741
"Unlawful Imprisonment
and Assault in the Third."

468
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:26,750
Is this accurate, Counselor?

469
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:28,512
I wouldn't waste
the court's time, Your Honor.

470
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,053
I'm not entirely sure
about that,

471
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:32,851
since you're trying to set
a very unusual precedent.

472
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:36,553
My sentiments exactly. Perhaps
someone's Iooking for ink.

473
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:37,855
Objection.

474
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:40,397
Save your strength,
Miss Cabot. You'II need it.

475
00:22:40,465 --> 00:22:42,092
How do you plead?
Not guilty.

476
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,066
Not guilty.
Are we severing?

477
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:45,363
Not at this time.

478
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,233
Any objection to recognizance?

479
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:48,636
None, Your Honor.

480
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,237
Next case.

481
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:54,470
I admit to having
intimate sexual relations
with the alleged victim,

482
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,378
a venal young man
who wants to be famous.

483
00:22:56,548 --> 00:23:00,177
My only crime is being
a confident,
assertive professional

484
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:02,550
with a healthy
sexual appetite.

485
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:03,985
If Peter Smith succeeds,

486
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:08,288
it will only numb the public
to the real plight
of rape victims everywhere.

487
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,486
By the time she's through,

488
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:11,028
she'II have victims'
advocates,

489
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:14,088
feminists and enlightened men
burning you in effigy.

490
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,497
Thanks for the heads up.

491
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,467
This indictment's Iudicrous.

492
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:20,232
Your client can spin
all she wants. We both know
what happened that night.

493
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:22,432
The grand jury
believed the victim,
another jury will, too.

494
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:26,171
You're making a mockery
of women who are
preyed on by men.

495
00:23:26,678 --> 00:23:28,839
They're the enemy,
not my client.

496
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:31,041
I guess I just heard
your closing argument.

497
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:34,847
There won't be a trial.
See you in chambers.

498
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:44,158
You wanted to see me?

499
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:47,164
AIex, it's a pretty
high-profile case.

500
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:49,427
You sure
you haven't bitten off
more than you can chew?

501
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:50,559
I don't think so.

502
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:54,538
But I guess since I've been
summoned here you don't agree.

503
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,405
Well, I have some doubts.

504
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:57,703
May I ask why?

505
00:23:57,776 --> 00:24:01,143
Using a male stripper
in the first real test
of the rape statute

506
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:02,874
is not a very
judicious choice.

507
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:04,381
His profession is irrelevant.

508
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,213
Are you asking me
to dismiss the charges?

509
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:07,547
No.

510
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:10,953
But I hope you won't mind
if Stan sits first chair.

511
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,623
You say that as if
I had a choice.

512
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:16,524
Oh, come on. We'II tag team.

513
00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:20,998
I just want you handling cross
on the female defendants
if they elect to testify.

514
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,360
I don't want to Iook Iike
Rick Lazio bullying Hillary.

515
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,533
You want me to run
for coffee, too,

516
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:29,073
or am I just the female
attorney by your side
for the cameras?

517
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:31,234
You're a highly skilled
attorney.

518
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,073
I have every faith
in your abilities.

519
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:34,772
But I'm still sitting
second chair.

520
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:37,941
You also have a personal
history with Pam Adler.

521
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:40,080
People will question
your motives.

522
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:41,983
I Iost an important case
to her once.

523
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,885
That does not mean
I have an agenda.

524
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:47,289
I don't Iike to play politics,
but we can't be naive.

525
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:50,322
If they find a way to use it,
they will.

526
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:51,957
Preemptive strike?

527
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,024
That, and just making sure
that our complaining witness
is protected

528
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:59,262
and represented
to the best of our ability.

529
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:02,307
We speak for him, so Iet's
keep our eye on the ball.

530
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:08,237
They want us to think
it's a motion to dismiss.

531
00:25:16,755 --> 00:25:19,280
They're trying to challenge
the Iaw.

532
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:24,459
This is a deceptive
attempt by the defense

533
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,657
to argue constitutional Iaw
in front of you.

534
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:29,064
This should only be heard
in an appellate court.

535
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,068
I intend to prove merit
for dismissal.

536
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,936
The Iegislature saw fit
to change the Iaw
for political correctness.

537
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:36,133
The old rape statute said

538
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,836
that only a man can be charged
with Rape in the First.

539
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,071
That's gender bias.

540
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:41,635
People v, Liberta,

541
00:25:41,914 --> 00:25:45,680
A bias pointed out by
a wife-raping convict
trying to get out on appeal.

542
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:49,084
Mr. Liberta did not win
that appeal and the only thing
the brief accomplished

543
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:51,418
was to force the Iegislature
to change the Iaw.

544
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,981
And they were so outraged
by the bias in the Iaw

545
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,495
that it took them 23 years
to do it. PIease.

546
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:00,296
Counselors?

547
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,732
It's still a constitutional
argument,

548
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:06,100
and it should only be heard
if Miss Maddox
Ioses the trial.

549
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:10,408
If it's all right with you,
I'II hear the argument anyway.

550
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:15,276
And trust me when I say,
be prepared,
be diligent and be very brief.

551
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:23,947
Rape is a violation of body
and mind, a violation that
comes through penetration.

552
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:25,853
Women can't rape men.

553
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:29,690
A woman can be prosecuted
for sodomy one by fellating
a man against his will.

554
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:31,752
She's not the penetrant,
but she's still guilty.

555
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,889
I contend that arousal
implies consent.

556
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:37,163
A physiological response
does not override a vocal,
"No."

557
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:40,295
Most men do not
maintain an erection
through fear, Counselor.

558
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:43,830
But some men do.
What do you propose,
a tumescence exam?

559
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,736
Save the wit for your friends,
Miss Cabot.

560
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,442
Medical studies document

561
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:53,075
that some female victims
experience arousal
during their attacks.

562
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:55,642
Rape is not about sex.
Rape is about violence,

563
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:57,018
and rape is about control.

564
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,286
No woman has ever
been brought to trial
under this charge

565
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,452
because we're the victims,
not the perpetrators.

566
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:05,087
It was not that Iong ago
that the court reacted
with disbelief

567
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:07,427
that a mother could murder
her own child.

568
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:09,626
Now she's the first person
we suspect.

569
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:12,670
Your Honor, women do not have
the anatomical equipment

570
00:27:12,738 --> 00:27:14,968
to be equal to men
under this Iaw.

571
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:17,803
The Iaw makes no room

572
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:20,709
for selective equality
under the First Amendment.

573
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:23,771
Either women are equal to men,
or they aren't.

574
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:25,677
Motion to dismiss is denied.

575
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:34,821
So, this means we go to trial?

576
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:36,019
It's a minor victory.

577
00:27:36,128 --> 00:27:37,459
Now comes the hard part.

578
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:39,224
It's already started.

579
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:41,925
I'm getting harassed.
Nasty phone calls.

580
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,164
Women following me,
shouting at me. Chased
by reporters and cameras.

581
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:47,804
Well, it's only
going to get worse,

582
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:50,535
because now the defense
has a chance to dig around
in your background,

583
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:52,076
poke holes in your story.

584
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:54,169
So anything
you want to change,
you'd better do now.

585
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:57,010
My father told me my private
Iife was inadmissible.

586
00:27:57,082 --> 00:27:58,811
Putting the victim on trial
isn't allowed.

587
00:27:58,884 --> 00:27:59,942
It isn't.

588
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:03,613
But I have to be honest
with you, there are ways
to get around it.

589
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:07,552
You seem very concerned.
Is there something
you haven't told me?

590
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:08,650
No.

591
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:14,489
Okay. Go home, get some rest.

592
00:28:17,135 --> 00:28:19,501
Is there any way
I can get a ride?

593
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:21,664
I know the vultures
are waiting out there.

594
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,970
Yeah, I'II take care of it.

595
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:31,407
VILLANI: What time did
Peter Smith show up
at the party, Miss Guevere?

596
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:35,613
I can't be sure
after all this time.
But around 10:00, maybe.

597
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:37,416
What happened then?

598
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:40,016
He did his dance.

599
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:44,126
He was shaking his stuff
in our faces,

600
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:50,027
and we'd slide dollars
into his thong. It had
a big badge in the front.

601
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:54,933
Were the defendants
present at that time?

602
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,804
To be honest,
my attention was elsewhere.

603
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,574
So, when did you notice
their absence?

604
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:02,443
When poor Sydney came out
and told us all to Ieave.

605
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:05,177
To Ieave?
Why do you think she did that?

606
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:06,650
Objection. Speculation.

607
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,609
Sustained.

608
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:10,121
VILLANI: I'II rephrase.

609
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:12,754
Was this something
that Miss Green usually did?

610
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:15,385
I mean, did she usually
invite people over
and then put them out?

611
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:19,488
No, she'd had parties before
and never acted Iike that.

612
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,768
I thought it was rude
at the time,

613
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,435
but I needed to get home
and relieve the babysitter.

614
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:29,966
Nothing further.

615
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:35,974
I have no questions
for this witness.

616
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:42,815
VILLANI: So, how did
Pam Adler, Sydney Green
and Amelia Chase subdue you?

617
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:46,358
One of them had
a Ietter opener.
She tried to stab me.

618
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:50,755
I kept backing up.
I just thought
she'd had too much to drink.

619
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,663
So, did you try to subdue her?
Did you try to get the weapon?

620
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:57,931
I couldn't. By this time,
the other two
were pulling me back.

621
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,236
I still thought I was okay.
Women get a Iittle drunk,

622
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:04,970
blow off some steam away from
their husbands for a night.

623
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:06,944
I usually handle it
and shrug it off.

624
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,037
But this was different?

625
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:09,843
Objection, Ieading.

626
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,547
What happened to make
this time different
than all the other times

627
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,214
when you had Ieft a job
unscathed?

628
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:21,483
When they cuffed me
to the bedpost.

629
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:22,917
It was so quick.

630
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,054
Who cuffed you to the bedpost?

631
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:34,468
For the record, the witness
is pointing to the defendant,
Amelia Chase.

632
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:36,670
And nothing further.

633
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:40,377
Objection.
Objection.

634
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:42,075
Approach.

635
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:52,451
I find an accused rapist
cross-examining
the victim repulsive.

636
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:53,651
Explain yourself.

637
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,559
Your Honor, Miss Adler
is a member of the bar
in good standing.

638
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:57,926
She's the co-counsel
of record,

639
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:01,194
and she's protected
by the constitution
to run her own defense.

640
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:04,031
This is an intimidation tactic
used to undermine the witness.

641
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:05,832
She is asking him
to relive the rape.

642
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,668
Objection, alleged rape.

643
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,970
It's an aggressive
psychological ploy.

644
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,306
That may very well
be the case, Mr. Villani,

645
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:15,176
but I don't have the power
to bar her from cross.

646
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:17,882
You take one step
over the Iine

647
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,078
and I will hold you
in contempt for the duration.

648
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:23,653
Step back.

649
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:38,193
Mr. Smith, do you go to a gym,
work out on a regular basis?

650
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,068
Objection, relevance.

651
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:43,201
My Iine of questioning
is within the scope.

652
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:44,570
I can clearly prove

653
00:31:44,644 --> 00:31:49,240
that this man is more than
capable of protecting himself
from three women.

654
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:51,011
PETROVSKY: Sustained.

655
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:54,714
Move on, Counselor.

656
00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:03,385
Mr. Smith, did you file
a civil suit for five million
dollars against Sydney Green?

657
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,692
Sir, don't Iook at them.
Look at me.

658
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:11,431
Did you file a civil suit?

659
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:12,732
Objection. Badgering.

660
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,102
PETER: I needed information.

661
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:15,435
ADLER: Yes or no?

662
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:16,770
That's not how it was.

663
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:21,471
Your Honor, please order
the witness to answer.

664
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:24,782
Sir, you have to answer
the question for the record.

665
00:32:30,556 --> 00:32:31,614
Yes.

666
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,061
Defense exhibit, Your Honor.

667
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:49,136
A copy of the civil suit filed
by the alleged rape victim,
four months ago.

668
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,733
I didn't want money.
I wanted names.

669
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:55,944
Your Honor, I move
for immediate dismissal.

670
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:08,291
What went wrong?

671
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,296
Your suspicions
were confirmed, Detective.

672
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,231
We were blind-sided
by a civil suit
filed by our rape victim.

673
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,427
I'm sorry, Miss Cabot.
I didn't think it mattered.

674
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:17,231
Everything matters.

675
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,568
You jeopardized this trial.
What else did you Iie about?

676
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,629
Nothing.

677
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,175
Now why would anybody
believe that?

678
00:33:23,243 --> 00:33:25,643
Why didn't you tell us
about the Iawsuit, Peter?

679
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,442
Detective Stabler's
been on my ass
from the very beginning,

680
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:29,641
Iooking for any reason
to drop it.

681
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,276
If I'd have told you
about the suit, he would've
said I just wanted money.

682
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:34,582
Well, isn't that what
this has been about all along,

683
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:36,019
a payday for you,
a Iittle media attention?

684
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:40,788
No. I wanted my
rapists' names. The cops
didn't treat me seriously.

685
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:42,692
How else was I supposed
to get the information?

686
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:45,197
If you'd won, you would've
received a monetary award.

687
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:47,790
If I won, the money
would have gone
to the animal shelter,

688
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,063
and my rapists' names
would've gone
on the public record.

689
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:51,195
That's very noble.

690
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:52,795
But I still don't see
how we're gonna prove

691
00:33:52,873 --> 00:33:54,500
that your motives
are anything but venal.

692
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,042
What if we talk
to the civil attorney,
get some corroboration?

693
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,304
Can we put him on the stand?

694
00:33:58,378 --> 00:33:59,675
This is just a spin.

695
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,977
What have you got
against me? I was raped.

696
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,414
Sydney Green
was coming forward.

697
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:07,715
What? Sydney Green called you?

698
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:11,749
My Iawyer. After you accused
me of killing her,
I called him.

699
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:13,918
He said Sydney had agreed
to give me the names,

700
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:17,589
but the death
nullified the suit.
So what did I do wrong?

701
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:25,504
Turns out Peter
was telling the truth.

702
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:28,132
The Iawyer said
he didn't want the money,
just the names.

703
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,766
Did he confirm Sydney Green's
compliance?

704
00:34:29,843 --> 00:34:30,969
The day before her death,

705
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,944
she contacted the Iawyer
to set up a meeting.

706
00:34:33,013 --> 00:34:34,105
STABLER: That's convenient.

707
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:36,274
BENSON:
Sounds Iike motive for murder.

708
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,316
Saves the trouble
of a high-profile trial,
maybe even a prison sentence.

709
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:43,379
I re-interviewed Andrew Green.
He didn't know
about the civil suit.

710
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,824
But Pam Adler had a copy
of it. How did she
even know it existed?

711
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:48,724
The record gets expunged
when abated by death,

712
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,660
so Adler had to have
a prior copy.

713
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,257
Sydney Green calls up
her friends, tells them she's
giving in, they kill her.

714
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:57,599
I thought the medical examiner
ruled the death accidental.

715
00:34:57,671 --> 00:34:59,696
No harm in taking
a second Iook.

716
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:04,205
Justin's a good pathologist
but not very imaginative.

717
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:05,972
You find something?

718
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:09,538
Female autoerotics are rare,
so it's hard to rule
on cause of death.

719
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:11,982
Which is why the first
suspicion was homicide.

720
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:14,680
But in this case,
that's what it should've been.

721
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:16,381
What did he miss?

722
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:19,516
Most women don't use porn.
They fantasize.

723
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:24,759
AIso, autoeroticism is
habit-forming. If your victim
frequently choked herself,

724
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:29,097
where's her towel
or silk scarf, something
to keep the rope from chafing?

725
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:32,868
It's vanity. No way to explain
the ring around the collar.

726
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:34,099
Some women don't use a buffer,

727
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,337
so they'II wear a turtleneck
or a scarf, something
to hide the evidence.

728
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,570
Well, if she were strangled,

729
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:40,636
wouldn't there be some
evidence of a struggle,

730
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:41,840
damage to the body?

731
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:44,884
It didn't take Iong
for the victim
to succumbed to hypoxia.

732
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:47,977
And the ropes
were tied properly,
so whoever staged this

733
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:49,851
is a practicing autoerotic.

734
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:53,017
Okay. Well, Doc,
you wanna take a Iook
at the crime scene?

735
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:54,185
Sure.

736
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,491
So the phone dump
shows two calls,

737
00:35:57,564 --> 00:35:59,225
one to each woman
the morning of the attack.

738
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:02,860
She gives them the news that
she's caving in to Peter's
demands to save her marriage.

739
00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:04,665
They decide to kill her.
They come prepared.

740
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:08,902
Quickest way to do that is
a blitz attack right here,
not in the bedroom.

741
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,670
You be the victim.

742
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:13,443
Okay.

743
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,008
They say, "Come on, Sydney,
Iet's talk about this.

744
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,244
"There's gotta be another way
that we can handle this,

745
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:21,651
"so we can deal with it,
okay?"

746
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:26,090
AII right. You did say
there was no struggle.

747
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,959
Exert a Iittle pressure,
and anoxia would occur
almost immediately.

748
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,488
As soon as she's out cold,
they carry her
into the bedroom.

749
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:38,402
Truss her, string her to
the fan, and the hypoxia
takes care of the rest.

750
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,697
We're thinking they staged
the scene, candles,
music, sexy teddy?

751
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:45,643
Maybe they didn't have to.
She was waiting
for her husband.

752
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:46,838
A Iittle make-up sex.

753
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,881
Looping the ropes
would have taken some time.

754
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:51,383
Not if you know
what you're doing.

755
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:57,683
CSU didn't dust for prints.

756
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,920
Not the whole beam.
Just the area around the fan.

757
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,633
This better be good,
Miss Cabot.

758
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:08,895
It is.

759
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:12,337
Your client is under arrest
for the murder
of Sydney Green.

760
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:13,667
So Iet's horse trade.

761
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,537
Depends on what you have.

762
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,009
PIead out to murder two
and all current charges.

763
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:19,978
In exchange for her testimony
against Pam Adler,

764
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:23,038
I'II give 12 and a half
for the homicide,
7-to-15 for the rape.

765
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,380
Your generosity overwhelms me.

766
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,216
It's a good deal, Mr. Harper.
Your client would be
advised to take it.

767
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,188
What are you basing this on?

768
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:33,124
Miss Chase's prints were found
at the crime scene.

769
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:35,353
My client was a friend.

770
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:39,125
She's been to the apartment
several times.
Prints will never hold up.

771
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,360
The victim was strangled,
Mr. Harper.

772
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:44,733
Your client's prints
were found on the bedroom
ceiling above the bed.

773
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:48,865
We also searched her apartment
and found autoerotic
paraphernalia.

774
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:54,010
It's all circumstantial.
We're done here.

775
00:37:55,348 --> 00:37:58,317
Ask your client
to remove the scarf
from around her neck.

776
00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:00,353
Oh, now, please...
Stop.

777
00:38:01,788 --> 00:38:03,847
Crunch your numbers again.

778
00:38:04,457 --> 00:38:08,587
By the time I get out of
prison, I'II be eligible for
senior citizens' discounts.

779
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,324
If I take this to trial,
you'II get Iife.

780
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,210
Tell me about the rape.

781
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:29,574
Sydney was getting married.
Neither one of us
Iiked the guy.

782
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:31,514
He seemed beneath her.

783
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:36,221
So Sydney planned her own
shower, booked a male stripper
as entertainment.

784
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:40,055
CABOT: So Peter Smith
entertained the Iadies
and then what?

785
00:38:40,894 --> 00:38:42,156
Pam pulled me aside,

786
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:45,857
said she'd worked out
an arrangement with the guy
for a private performance.

787
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:48,230
I thought, "What the hell?"
He was hot.

788
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:49,632
What happened then?

789
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:53,431
Pam and I went into
Sydney's office to wait.

790
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:54,940
After Peter followed
Mrs. Green into the bedroom,

791
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:56,738
what happened next?

792
00:38:57,178 --> 00:38:59,703
We cuffed him to the bed
and raped him.

793
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,308
I got his keys out of his
pants pocket and released him
when we were done.

794
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:07,582
Pam threw some cash at him
and he Ieft.

795
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:10,048
Thank you. Nothing further.

796
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:17,161
Do you know
how the Iaw defines Rape
in the First Degree?

797
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,291
Sexual intercourse
through forcible compulsion.

798
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:26,335
And is it your testimony that
that's what happened?

799
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:27,533
That's correct?

800
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:28,700
Yes.

801
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:36,715
Three women raped a 6-foot,
170-pound man.

802
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:39,410
Is that what you did?

803
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:40,476
Yes.

804
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:47,094
Well, did any of you
have a gun, a knife,
a weapon of any kind at all?

805
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:49,152
Pam had been waving
a Ietter opener.

806
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,788
Well, was it sharp?

807
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:53,023
No.

808
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,125
Did my client say anything
to the stripper?

809
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,032
Did she give him orders?

810
00:39:57,104 --> 00:40:01,837
No. She Iunged at him
a couple of times,
and he kept jumping back.

811
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,646
Who handcuffed him to the bed?

812
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,514
I did.

813
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:19,788
So you raped the stripper,
not my client. My client
paid for his services.

814
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,691
Objection.
Is there a question?

815
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:23,093
Sorry.

816
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:27,298
Did paying Mr. Smith
seem Iike the act of a rapist

817
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:29,697
or that of
a satisfied customer?

818
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,794
Objection.

819
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:34,773
Was it your testimony
that Miss Adler made
arrangements for Mr. Smith

820
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:36,605
to have a private performance?

821
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:37,939
That's what she said but...

822
00:40:38,012 --> 00:40:39,912
And did you see her
give him money?

823
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,073
A simple yes or no will do.

824
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:44,910
Yes.

825
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,261
On the charge of Rape
in the First Degree,
how do you find the defendant?

826
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:04,736
Not guilty.

827
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,174
On the charge of Sodomy
in the First Degree?

828
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:10,008
Not guilty.

829
00:41:10,478 --> 00:41:12,708
Unlawful imprisonment?

830
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,838
Not guilty.

831
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,547
And Assault
in the Third Degree?

832
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,746
Guilty.

833
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:22,513
The defendant is free to go
until sentencing.

834
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:24,424
Court is adjourned.

835
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:38,536
Peter, I'm sorry
we didn't get them both.

836
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:40,940
One's better than none.

837
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,975
Congratulations, Counselor.

838
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,640
You put up a good fight, AIex.

839
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:53,414
Well, I didn't get the ruling
I wanted, but maybe next time.

840
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:05,631
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)

841
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:08,634
You're under arrest for
the murder of Sydney Green.

842
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:11,330
I'II beat this charge, too,
Counselor. Just watch me.

843
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:14,806
AII of your
courtroom knowledge
won't get you out of this one.

844
00:42:16,443 --> 00:42:18,240
MAN: How did this happen?

845
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:24,749
Looks Iike next time's now.
Feel Iike bargaining
over a drink?

846
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:27,048
My best offer is 25.

847
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:29,089
Sixteen,
you can pick up the bar tab.

848
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:31,556
That's crazy.
She'd be out in 12.
