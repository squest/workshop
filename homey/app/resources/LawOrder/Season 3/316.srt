NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,932
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:05,167
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:08,301
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:11,745
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:13,782
These are their stories,

7
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:15,841
(BELL RINGING)

8
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:18,379
It's not as serious
as it sounds.

9
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:21,150
If Kathleen doesn't pull her
grades up, she'II have to
go to summer school.

10
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:22,782
I find that pretty serious.

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,622
We're working on it.
She's making progress.

12
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:26,559
And why am I now
just hearing about this?

13
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:27,653
Because you work really hard,

14
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,563
and most nights
you're not home
until the kids are in bed.

15
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:35,134
Kathleen,
who are you talking to?
A friend.

16
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:36,193
Get off the phone.
Dad.

17
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:38,001
Now. Now.

18
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:39,839
I'II call you back.

19
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,139
It isn't what you think.
I was getting help
on a math assignment.

20
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:44,202
Hey, I got news for you.
Things are going to change
around here.

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,680
No mall, no friends,
no phone until further notice.

22
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:48,580
That's not fair. Mom?

23
00:00:53,022 --> 00:00:56,981
You know, it is abundantly
clear to me, you are a parent
and I am a paycheck.

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,324
You're a good father,
but you're overreacting.

25
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,828
You know, we're pretty Iucky.

26
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:03,365
We've never had
any real trouble
with the kids.

27
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:05,162
Trouble's relative.

28
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:08,260
I heard about a girl today
who was raped by her teacher.

29
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:11,238
She's scared to death,
refuses to go to the police,

30
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:12,569
won't even tell her family.

31
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:14,166
Now that's what
I call trouble.

32
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:15,335
Who are you talking about?

33
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,571
I don't know her.

34
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:17,635
She get medical attention?

35
00:01:17,713 --> 00:01:20,773
My friend Carol
at St. Matthew's,
she did a rape kit.

36
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,115
She says she doesn't want
to report it and she's got
to keep it confidential.

37
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:25,449
She shouldn't have told me.

38
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:28,081
Carol's bound by Iaw
not to release
any of that information

39
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:29,181
if that's what
the victim chooses.

40
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:32,716
Yeah, but that's ridiculous,
'cause the girl's only 14.

41
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:35,359
Grown women think twice
about reporting it.

42
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,991
After a violation Iike that,
you know, it's tough
to know who to trust.

43
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:40,661
She should at Ieast
tell her parents.

44
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:43,803
Maybe they're not around.

45
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:47,934
Nope. From what I understand,
she comes from a good home
with both parents.

46
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:54,179
Well, my experience says
Mom and Dad
are the Iast resort.

47
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,282
What school she go to?

48
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,045
Why?

49
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,455
Maybe they have a decent
counselor to help her out.

50
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:08,888
If this girl doesn't want
to talk to her parents
or the police,

51
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:11,263
why would
she tell a counselor?

52
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:15,927
This girl is going to develop
disciplinary problems
or depression.

53
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,737
If she's Iucky enough,
the school will have
qualified teachers

54
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,799
to recognize the symptoms.

55
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:24,309
Well, Tucker Junior High's
got a good reputation,

56
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,245
so I hope you're right.

57
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:28,408
It's too quiet upstairs.

58
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,189
Hey, EIIiot.
What're you doing here?
Are you on a case?

59
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,460
No. Actually,
I'm here to see you.

60
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:46,058
What about?

61
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:48,035
I need her name, Carol.

62
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:50,765
I can't believe
Kathy broke my confidence.
It wasn't deliberate.

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,864
I don't care.

64
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:54,102
I promise I won't tell anyone
where I got the information.

65
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:56,577
Look. You know
I can't give it to you.
And even if I did,

66
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:59,945
you can't do a damn thing
about it without Iosing your
job, and costing me mine.

67
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:01,711
I'II keep you out of it.

68
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:04,947
Carol, you have to want
to help this girl. She's 14.
She's been raped.

69
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:09,355
As far as you're concerned,
Detective Stabler,
this girl doesn't exist.

70
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:09,444
OIivia, I need a favor.

71
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,079
Okay.

72
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:12,279
Bear in mind I don't have
any money.

73
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:14,755
I'm an underpaid
detective, just Iike you.

74
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:19,286
What I want is risky.

75
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:21,258
Well, Iet me decide.

76
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:25,296
I need you to check
an ER sign-in Iog.

77
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,965
Why can't you do it?

78
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:32,297
A 14-year-old girl
was raped by a teacher.

79
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,674
She got the exam
at the hospital, but she
didn't want to report it.

80
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:38,942
Kathy knows the nurse
who works there, but if she
sees me snooping around...

81
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:40,949
She absolutely
is not supposed
to give out that information.

82
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,952
I know. I just got to
make sure that it's real.

83
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:45,943
And then what?

84
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:49,618
Convince her to come forward.

85
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,356
Not a good idea, EIIiot.

86
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:52,485
She's just scared, OIivia.

87
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:55,530
She's a kid who doesn't know
that there are people out
there who want to help her.

88
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:58,624
And if she doesn't
want to tell us,
then we can't make her.

89
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:02,501
So she just sits
in the classroom
being taught by her rapist.

90
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,730
What hospital?

91
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,309
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)

92
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:11,640
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Can I help you?

93
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:14,410
OIivia Benson,
Special Victims. I'm here
to interview the rape victim.

94
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,451
We didn't call
any assaults today.
You sure?

95
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,350
I just go where they tell me.

96
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:19,718
What's the victim's name?

97
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,984
Munch, Margaret K.

98
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,484
No one here by that name.

99
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,422
Okay. Mix-ups happen.
Victims' names get mangled,

100
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:32,831
which hospitals
they're sent to,
even precinct assignments.

101
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:34,460
You must see a Iot of victims.

102
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:37,870
They're traumatized enough.
They don't need
to wait for me.

103
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:39,465
How can I help you?

104
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,703
Let me take a Iook
at the sign-in sheet
for the past two days,

105
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:45,679
and I'II call the precinct,
verify the information
I've got.

106
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,478
Thanks.

107
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,689
(BELL RINGING)

108
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:59,424
You suspect a teacher
of raping one of my students,

109
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:02,259
but you don't even know
the girl's name?

110
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,259
Are you sure she isn't Iying
to cover something else?

111
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:09,998
Well, I won't know that
unless I talk to her. She was
probably absent yesterday,

112
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:13,098
so if I could take a Iook
at the Iist
of absentee students

113
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:14,301
I think I'II find my victim.

114
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:16,868
Sounds to me Iike your victim
doesn't want to be found.

115
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:19,414
And are you comfortable
having a teacher
using his authority

116
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,507
to prey on children
under your responsibility?

117
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,415
That doesn't even
deserve a response.

118
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:26,614
I give you my word
that I won't approach anyone
until I'm sure I'm right.

119
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,852
I promise that I'II
handle this with discretion.

120
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:36,094
You're sticking your neck
way out there, aren't you?

121
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:39,167
Ma'am,
under the circumstances,
wouldn't you?

122
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:48,466
Okay, here it is.
Cynthia Wilmont.
Signed in at 9:45 a.m.

123
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,944
According to this Iist,
she had a note from home
explaining her absence.

124
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:54,813
Well, it's got to be
a forgery. I used to do it
all the time. Everyone does.

125
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,751
Except, of course, your kids.
I'm sure that you're
very intimidating.

126
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,618
Yeah, I'm real scary.

127
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,120
Okay, so how do we
play this one out?

128
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:07,424
I can't Iet you do anything
else. If it hits the fan,
I want you covered.

129
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:09,054
Well, it's a Iittle Iate
for that, EIIiot.

130
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:12,066
If anyone goes digging,
they go straight back to me.

131
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:15,035
I had to show my ID
to get access
to the sign-in sheet.

132
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:19,006
Well, if we talk to this girl,
I'm going to need
to cover our ass.

133
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:23,738
Have you Ieft anything out?

134
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:26,748
No. That's everything.
Our rape victim's an eighth
grader at Tucker Junior High.

135
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,078
Her name is Cynthia Wilmont.

136
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,347
I just didn't
want to pursue it
without talking to you first.

137
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,047
Now that's the first
sensible thing
you've said,

138
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:34,384
because you're
going to have to drop it.

139
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:35,481
Captain.

140
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:39,426
No. You have Ieft the city,
the hospital and yourself
open to a Iawsuit.

141
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:41,326
We're talking about
a minor here.

142
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,627
Now, there's got to be a way
to circumvent that.

143
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,100
Once you talk to the girl,
she's going to know
the nurse gave her up.

144
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,602
You open that can of worms,

145
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:51,196
victims advocates
will want your blood,
and I will give it to them.

146
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:54,242
I'd think they'd be the first
ones who'd want us to
catch this hump.

147
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,074
EIIiot, it's hard enough
to get adult women to report.

148
00:07:57,146 --> 00:08:01,207
If victims feel no confidence,
they won't even go in
for the exam.

149
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:03,711
Now, you are
going to drop this

150
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:06,755
until she is ready to come
forward on her own.

151
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:09,047
It's her teacher, Captain,

152
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:11,419
and he gets away with this,
he's not going stop.

153
00:08:11,494 --> 00:08:14,952
At the very Ieast, Iet's just
get him out of the school.

154
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,034
You have the victim brought
to the principal's office
for a sit-down.

155
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:26,836
If she doesn't want to talk,
you back off.

156
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:28,935
AII right.

157
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:32,469
And you go
behind my back again,
it goes in your jacket.

158
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,788
I guess you found her.

159
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:44,849
An eighth grader,
Cynthia Wilmont.

160
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:50,624
Sheila, can you get
Cynthia Wilmont to come
to my office, please?

161
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,564
We'd also Iike a Iist
of her teachers.

162
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:56,264
Now, that I can't do.

163
00:08:56,772 --> 00:08:57,830
Unofficially.

164
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:01,536
You need a subpoena
before I can give you
information about a teacher.

165
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,078
You do know what we're trying
to accomplish here, don't you?

166
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:06,944
And I applaud your efforts,
but whoever this person is,

167
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:09,382
he has rights
until he's been accused.

168
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,612
Especially since it's Cynthia.

169
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,951
Have you noticed any change
in her behavior?

170
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:17,390
She hasn't been brought
to my office on any
disciplinary action.

171
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,654
Other than that,
you'II have to talk
to her teachers,

172
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:22,492
and that I can't allow
until you have
an actual complaint.

173
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:27,002
Cynthia Wilmont is Iaying down
in the nurse's office
with a stomach ache.

174
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:29,227
You might
want to do this Iater.

175
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:32,502
If she doesn't want
to speak with us, we'II Ieave.

176
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:39,180
Take the detectives to the
nurse's office

177
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:41,546
and make sure
they have some privacy.

178
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,811
BENSON: Thanks.

179
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,115
(DOOR OPENS)

180
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:49,383
SHEILA: These people
need to talk to Cynthia
in private for a minute.

181
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,153
Sure.
We'II be right outside.

182
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:52,557
Thank you.

183
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:58,429
Hi, Cynthia.
I'm OIivia Benson
and this is EIIiot Stabler.

184
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,001
You're cops.

185
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:03,364
You're right. We know
you're not feeling well,

186
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:04,997
but we were wondering
if, maybe, there was something

187
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:07,167
that you might Iike
to talk to us about?

188
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:08,573
CYNTHIA: Like what?

189
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:11,111
Well, has anyone
been bothering you Iately?

190
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,340
No.

191
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,510
STABLER: Do you Iike
all your teachers?

192
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,811
Why are you asking me that?

193
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:17,613
BENSON:
Because we want to help you.

194
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:20,246
Did somebody tell you
that I'm in trouble?

195
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:21,619
It's not true.

196
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:29,326
Cynthia, you can tell us
if somebody touched you,
no matter what.

197
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:32,161
I don't understand.

198
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:35,435
Did anything bad happen to you
the day before yesterday?

199
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:36,698
No.

200
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:38,171
Then why aren't
you feeling well?

201
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:42,542
Are you going to talk
to my parents?

202
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,169
Absolutely not.

203
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:47,704
Why should I believe you?
Why should I believe
anything you say?

204
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:48,875
Because it's true.

205
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:50,578
Yeah, I've heard that before.

206
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:53,986
That nurse promised me
that she wouldn't say a word.

207
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,690
No one else knows,
not even my best friend.

208
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,558
So she had to have told you.

209
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:03,397
She Iied and now so are you.

210
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:07,731
Cynthia, if you tell us
who did this, we can make sure
he never does it again.

211
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:10,328
I'm fine. No one
did anything to me.

212
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:14,233
(BELL RINGING)

213
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,867
She's scared to death.

214
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:17,411
Got any suggestions?

215
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,775
None that'II make her happy.

216
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,372
We cannot go to her parents.

217
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,781
About my kid,
I'd want to know.

218
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:24,478
This isn't about you
or her parents.

219
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,578
She's a child
who doesn't know
what she's doing,

220
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,714
and we need her testimony
to go after this bastard,

221
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,849
before he makes a habit of it.

222
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:32,951
You expect her to come forward
when most women won't.

223
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:34,928
Either she's a kid,
or she's an adult, EIIiot.

224
00:11:34,997 --> 00:11:36,555
You can't have it both ways.

225
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:41,000
Hey, Kath.

226
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,469
OIivia.

227
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:45,735
I'II update the captain.
Nice to see you.

228
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:49,341
You're angry.

229
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:52,403
Actually, I'm not,
and that's what scares me.

230
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,582
You know why
I had to pursue this.

231
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,848
I know I Iost
a good friend today.

232
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:01,787
But you Iost something
much more important,

233
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:05,020
and either
you don't realize it
or you don't care.

234
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:07,119
Now you know that's not true.

235
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:09,221
You played me, EIIiot.

236
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:10,797
You carried on
that conversation,

237
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:13,562
drawing information out of me
Iike I was your witness.

238
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:17,935
You know what happens
to rape victims when they
don't deal with the trauma.

239
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:23,137
This girl's got drug and
alcohol abuse in her future,
just to dull the pain,

240
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:25,976
and then comes
the inability to connect,

241
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:28,949
the promiscuity
because she thinks
she had it coming to her.

242
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:32,009
Either way, she's screwed
until she gets help.

243
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:38,216
A teacher is responsible,
and you know I just
can't Iet this slide.

244
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:44,825
I know you too well for that
but everything has a price,

245
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,460
and I just hope
that you can pay it.

246
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:55,133
EII, Carol Porter just called
from St. Matthew's.
Cynthia's been admitted.

247
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,940
Somebody tossed her
down a flight of steps.

248
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:09,647
We're Iooking for a minor,
female. Her name
is Cynthia Wilmont.

249
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:11,352
Came with multiple injuries
from a fall.

250
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:14,862
She's in the O.R.,
getting a pin
in a badly broken arm.

251
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,490
You have any idea
how it happened?

252
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:22,867
I don't have the whole story,
but Cynthia claims
she fell down the stairs.

253
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:25,429
At school?
Couple of blocks from home.

254
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:27,566
Good Samaritan found her,
called a bus.

255
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:30,737
She's got a black eye,
a broken arm
and fractured ribs.

256
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:33,782
Her injuries
don't sound consistent
with an accident.

257
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:36,682
Did you go to the school
and question her?

258
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:37,878
Why do you ask?

259
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:40,319
Because she blames me,
Detective.

260
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,380
She became agitated
when I entered the exam room.

261
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,152
I was ordered to Ieave
to calm her down.

262
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:46,990
Carol, I am so sorry
you got caught
in the middle of all this.

263
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:49,496
That makes me feel
so much better.

264
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,101
You're still pursuing this?
Unofficially.

265
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,196
What else can you tell us?

266
00:13:57,175 --> 00:13:59,735
Look, if it wasn't
an accident, then maybe
our presence at the school

267
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:03,372
did cause the rapist to panic.
Trying to intimidate her.

268
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,579
I think she's
been raped more than once.

269
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:08,118
What makes you say that?

270
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:10,086
She came in
with abdominal pain,

271
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:13,215
so the doctor was obliged
to do a vaginal exam.

272
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,655
She's got
pelvic inflammatory disease,
caused by gonorrhea.

273
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:18,787
Did you do an STD screen
with the rape kit?

274
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:20,889
Sure, but once it moves
to the fallopian tubes,

275
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:22,058
the test can come up negative.

276
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:23,896
Well, doesn't it take weeks
to develop PID?

277
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:25,300
If the gonorrhea
goes untreated.

278
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,304
MAN: Nurse.
Excuse me.

279
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,373
Well, after this beating,
Cynthia's just
going to dig in.

280
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:33,411
There is no way
she's going to talk to us.

281
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:35,912
Well, she doesn't
have a choice anymore.

282
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:39,246
We find out who assaulted her,
we'II find her rapist.

283
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:42,150
Her parents should be
in the waiting room.

284
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:47,215
First they call and tell me
my Iittle girl's been hurt.

285
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:50,993
Then they tell us she has
gonorrhea. I mean,
have you all gone crazy?

286
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:54,759
Public health has to be
notified to contact anybody
that Cynthia's been with.

287
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,767
My daughter did not
give this to anyone.

288
00:14:56,835 --> 00:15:00,134
Well, she didn't get gonorrhea
from the toilet seat.

289
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:05,272
STABLER:
Did anyone have a problem
with your daughter?

290
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:07,868
She get into a fight
with someone recently,
or an argument?

291
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:08,970
No.

292
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,943
Does your daughter
have any boyfriends?

293
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:14,042
No.

294
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,715
Where were you and your wife
when this happened?

295
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:23,555
I was at work.
She was at home. Why?

296
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:26,896
Just routine questions.

297
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:30,263
STABLER: Does Cynthia
have any close friends
we could talk to?

298
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:33,703
You could try Amy Bergen,
maybe she would
know something.

299
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:35,899
She's Cynthia's best friend.

300
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:41,206
Should have told Cynthia's
parents right away, instead
of going to the school.

301
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,303
We could have prevented this.

302
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,746
Depends on who's responsible.
I want to check
the parents out.

303
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,716
You think
they tossed their daughter
down a flight of stairs?

304
00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:49,583
Her father seemed pretty upset
about his daughter having sex.

305
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:51,246
She didn't. She was raped.

306
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:54,690
And what if she fabricated
the rape to cover up
sexual activity?

307
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,885
We've had Iots of cases
Iike that.

308
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,452
Well, you saw that girl.
She was afraid of someone.

309
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,929
Maybe it's Dad.

310
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,397
What, you think he raped her?

311
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,764
We've seen it
too many times before.

312
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:05,063
Cynthia does have the clap.

313
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,865
Daddy gave it to her,
Mommy's got to have it.

314
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:08,633
You really see her covering
for her husband?

315
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:10,675
I don't know.
I just think we should
check the whereabouts

316
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:12,733
of the parents
during the assault.

317
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:15,302
First Iet's check out
the best friend.

318
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:21,650
This is terrible. I should
call Darlene. See if there's
anything I can do.

319
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,745
You sure Amy knows
something about this?

320
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:26,950
If Cynthia had tension
with someone,
Amy probably knows who.

321
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,289
If you don't mind,
we'd Iike to speak
to her alone.

322
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:30,419
Why?

323
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:33,623
Kids tend to keep secrets,
especially from their parents.

324
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:35,290
She might shut down
in your presence.

325
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:36,766
I don't think I Iike this.

326
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:40,635
Her best friend
is in the hospital.
First door on your right.

327
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:47,874
Shut the door, please.

328
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:53,482
I know who you are.

329
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:56,952
I saw you at my school
and Cynthia said
you were asking questions.

330
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:58,819
Did she tell you why?

331
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:01,954
Is it true that
somebody beat her up?

332
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:03,790
Looks Iike it.

333
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,163
Do you have any idea
who might have
done this to her?

334
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:10,133
I promise I don't know
anything about that.

335
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:12,535
Your friend needs help.

336
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,602
Does Cynthia have a boyfriend?

337
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,074
Tommy Kessler.

338
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:22,238
Do you know if
they're having sex?

339
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:24,713
We fool around
but we don't go all the way.

340
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:27,183
"We"? What do you mean, "We"?

341
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:35,519
Amy, you are not in trouble.
What we say here
does not Ieave this room.

342
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:41,292
Okay, we have a club.

343
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:42,833
Tommy and his best friend,
Nick,

344
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:46,098
they throw parties
and we fool around,
but that's all.

345
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:48,605
STABLER: What do you mean,
you fool around?

346
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:52,273
We do stuff for beer.

347
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:55,943
Like what?

348
00:17:57,715 --> 00:18:00,240
Well, Tommy
gets together a group,

349
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:04,778
and the girls do the guys,
and they supply the beer.

350
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,355
You're talking about oral sex.

351
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,228
Do you use condoms?

352
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:21,266
That's gross.
We don't have sex.
I told you that.

353
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:24,740
Well, when was the Iast time
you had one of these parties?

354
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,505
Day before yesterday,
and it was
the best one so far.

355
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,069
STABLER: Cynthia there?

356
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:34,578
Yeah, she goes to every one.
She has to if she wants
to stay Tommy's girl.

357
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:36,176
And why's that?

358
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,893
Well, Cynthia's my best friend
and I Iove her,

359
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:47,053
but she's no hottie, you know?

360
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:54,869
I hate talking
to kids this age.

361
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:57,203
That's 'cause
you can't smack them
if they give you Iip.

362
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,401
Who says I can't?

363
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,535
Then what is your issue
with the pubescent set?

364
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:03,877
The stink of pimple cream
turns my stomach.

365
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:06,342
Where is this Iittle player?

366
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,417
Over there.

367
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,051
(CHATTERING)

368
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:12,948
FIN: Tommy Kessler?

369
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:21,027
We need to talk to you, too,
Nicky. Come here.

370
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,124
Cops. That's cool.

371
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:25,729
So what's up, brother?

372
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:27,031
Your cancer.

373
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:30,571
I feel you.
Oh, you "feel" me?

374
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:33,975
Don't hit him. Let's talk
about Cynthia Wilmont.

375
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,471
Heard she got hurt.
She okay?

376
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,379
She got jacked up.
What you know about it?

377
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:41,646
We saw her Ieave school
but we went the other way.

378
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:45,186
That's how it happened,
Tommy?

379
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:46,245
Yeah.

380
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:48,316
What happened
a couple nights ago
at your party?

381
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:50,452
Cynthia service anyone,
besides you?

382
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,962
Oh, man. I knew
this would happen.
TOMMY: Shut up.

383
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:55,963
MUNCH: Who was the Iucky guy?

384
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:59,335
It doesn't matter.
Look, everybody does it.

385
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:04,606
It's not sex, so a guy
doesn't get pissed if his girl
chicken heads someone else.

386
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:10,311
Better tell him, Tommy.
I don't want trouble
with my parents.

387
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:15,912
I didn't have money for brew,
so Cynthia offered
to try to get us some.

388
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:17,011
So you pimped her?

389
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:19,989
No. She's my girlfriend.
She Iikes to do me favors.

390
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:22,151
Who else was she with
that night?

391
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:29,529
Nick, because it was
his birthday. And there
was this older guy, he...

392
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:31,330
Tall, he had brown hair.

393
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,302
I've seen him before.
My sister Mia knows him.

394
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:34,633
MUNCH: How old?

395
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,197
Well, not grandpa old, Iike
you, but old.

396
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:38,936
Twenty, thirty
or something. I don't know.

397
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,275
And Cynthia went off with him
in exchange for what?

398
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,010
I don't want to say.

399
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:49,710
You know I want
to smack you, right?

400
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:54,454
It was for some ex.
We were celebrating.

401
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,125
Swing parties for kids.

402
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:06,762
And since when is oral sex
not sex?

403
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:08,396
Since Bill CIinton said so.

404
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:11,067
Well, Tommy says
the older guy's
got to be our teacher

405
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:12,973
and his sister
can tell us who he is.

406
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:14,978
But if he taught junior high,
Tommy would have known him.

407
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:19,779
Are you sure? Maybe there
is no teacher and Cynthia's
just covering up.

408
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:22,547
It's still statutory rape,
whether or not
it was consensual.

409
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,349
Doesn't matter.
Without a complaining witness,

410
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:25,719
the rape doesn't exist.

411
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,884
Unless we can tie this man
to the assault, we have
nothing to charge him with.

412
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,394
Tommy knows more
than he's telling.
You catch that Iook?

413
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:35,023
I wish I could catch
the Iittle bastard in the act
and charge him for pandering.

414
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,033
He's got Cynthia
hooking for alcohol and drugs.

415
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:38,534
Yeah, what about the drugs?

416
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:41,037
The ecstasy's been consumed
so the evidentiary Iink
is gone.

417
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:43,972
Is there any way
to get the rape kit
without a 61?

418
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,407
If we can prove
an adult was with the minor,

419
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,239
her parents can request
a rape kit be released.

420
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:50,748
But once we ID the perp,
Tommy's statement isn't enough
to get a warrant for his DNA.

421
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:53,181
We'd need
a corroborating witness,
or Cynthia to come clean.

422
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:54,741
So we'II talk to her again,
all right?

423
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,980
I would wait
until she's released
from the hospital.

424
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:59,819
In the meantime, Munch, Fin,
talk to Tommy's sister.

425
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:04,089
Get an ID on this adult
with a penchant
for crashing teenage parties.

426
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:12,326
Parents around?

427
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:15,463
My mom's Iaying down
and my dad's working Iate.

428
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,301
They don't need to know
about this, right?

429
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,811
Thought it was no big deal.
Everybody does it, right?

430
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:25,004
Don't sweat it, kid.
We're here
Iooking for your sister.

431
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:27,810
Mia's in her room studying.

432
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:31,479
Mia.
MIA: Go away, you Iittle snot.

433
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:35,185
(SNIFFING)

434
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:42,755
You know,
I'm going to break your...

435

(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

436
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,301
Damn, what kind of weed
you toking on in here, girl?

437
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:54,638
Make yourselves at home.

438
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:55,940
We plan to.

439
00:22:59,618 --> 00:23:00,812
What?

440
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:04,185
Let's chat about you and your
brother's sex parties.

441
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,653
I don't know
what you're talking about.

442
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:09,626
We could wake your mom,
if you want us to.

443
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:11,856
You could try.

444
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,830
She's not sleeping.
She's passed out.

445
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,161
MUNCH: You had a party
two nights ago.

446
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:18,601
Your brother's girlfriend,
Cynthia Wilmont, was here.
Remember her?

447
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,604
That mousy skank
is his girlfriend?

448
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:22,230
Skank?

449
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:25,743
Hey, she gets around.
What else am I
supposed to call her?

450
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:27,676
Hey, you can't do that
without a warrant.

451
00:23:27,746 --> 00:23:29,043
Yes, he can.

452
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:32,743
Probable cause is defined as
reasonable knowledge
of a criminal act.

453
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:35,582
See, the Ionger you stall,
the more time I have
to find your stash,

454
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:37,713
and when I find it,
I'm taking you in.

455
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,054
You're not
going to juvie, sweet pea.

456
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:42,284
What do you want to know?

457
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:44,056
Who attends
your Iittle soirees?

458
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:47,922
Just friends from school.

459
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,731
I Iet my brother bring
his friends 'cause he
threatened to squeal.

460
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:54,295
Turns out they party harder
than high school kids.

461
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:58,207
Smoke a Iittle weed, Iisten
to some tunes, one thing
turns into another, right?

462
00:23:58,277 --> 00:24:02,304
You Iook Iike you did
some damage in your day.
Where's the crime?

463
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:05,205
IIIegal drugs
and statutory rape.

464
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,445
Who got raped?

465
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,010
A witness statement
from one of your guests

466
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:12,386
places an adult
at this shindig.

467
00:24:13,592 --> 00:24:15,719
You must mean Ross McKenzie.

468
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,258
Describe him.

469
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:23,290
He's 24, built,
kind of cute, very cool.

470
00:24:25,471 --> 00:24:27,769
Hey, if you think he raped
anybody, you're crazy.

471
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,102
And why's that?

472
00:24:29,174 --> 00:24:31,574
Well, 'cause he can have
anybody he wants.

473
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:33,668
He's a substitute teacher
at my high school

474
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:36,942
and he's only interested
in mature women Iike me.

475
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,875
Well, I guess we found
our teacher.

476
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:41,715
What do we have
so far on this creep?

477
00:24:41,787 --> 00:24:45,086
Ross McKenzie, 24,
assigned to Harrison High.

478
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:48,217
Described by
one of his students
as the epitome of cool.

479
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:50,625
You'd think
with all that Iegal
nubile flesh around there,

480
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:51,993
he'd sample that instead.

481
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:54,089
Evidently he Iikes them
a Iot younger.

482
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:57,863
Board of education has him
Iisted as a substitute teacher
for the Iast two years.

483
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,597
One arrest. No convictions.

484
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:03,163
A bust fell apart three
years ago for soliciting
an eight ball of coke.

485
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:05,210
MUNCH: From entrapment?
Yeah.

486
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:07,837
Which is why
he didn't have to put it
on his school application.

487
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:10,074
Well, if he's our perp,
how did he know
that we talked to Cynthia?

488
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:11,410
He doesn't teach
middle school.

489
00:25:11,483 --> 00:25:15,317
Kids talk. Tommy could
have told his sister.
She informed McKenzie.

490
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:19,050
Well, if this teacher
did do it, then he definitely
wasn't working that day,

491
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:21,684
since the high school Iets out
after Cynthia was attacked.

492
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,786
So check with
the Harrison principal
on McKenzie's whereabouts.

493
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:28,492
If this pans out, haul him in
for a hard interview.

494
00:25:32,738 --> 00:25:36,196
The kids Iove him.
He Iistens to their music,
he talks their talk,

495
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:38,140
and they call him
by his first name.

496
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,178
Well, what's wrong with that,
if the kids Iearn?

497
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:44,181
BIur the Iine between
student and teacher
and chaos will ensue.

498
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:45,807
What's McKenzie done exactly?

499
00:25:45,884 --> 00:25:48,352
We're still Iooking into it.
Was he working Monday?

500
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,821
Not here, but that doesn't
mean he wasn't working
at another school.

501
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,554
In case you haven't heard,
we're short on qualified
teachers, money and supplies,

502
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:58,789
which just causes us
to Iower our standards.

503
00:25:58,864 --> 00:25:59,853
You don't Iike him.

504
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:01,695
I can't afford
to dislike anyone.

505
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:04,895
But I take issue with
Iax rules and fraternizing
with the students.

506
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,870
BENSON: Has anyone
Iodged a complaint
against him?

507
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:09,271
Not yet, but it's
only a matter of time.

508
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:10,638
Where's McKenzie now?

509
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,011
He has a free period.
You should find him
in the teacher's Iounge.

510
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:21,148
BENSON: Ross McKenzie?
Yeah?

511
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:24,247
Detectives Benson and Stabler,
we'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

512
00:26:24,323 --> 00:26:25,347
What's this about?

513
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:26,448
It's a sensitive subject,

514
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:28,823
so we'd Iike to take this back
to our precinct.

515
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:31,158
Well, I've got classes.
Have somebody cover for you.

516
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:32,856
Not until I find out
what this is about.

517
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:34,592
Well, I guess we can
interview you right here.

518
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:38,500
We need answers about
drug distribution and
sex parties involving minors.

519
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,935
You ready?

520
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:43,099
Okay, okay. Just give me
a couple of minutes
to talk to the principal.

521
00:26:43,175 --> 00:26:46,269
BENSON: It's already done.
Why don't you grab your coat?

522
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:52,310
You Iike substitute teaching?

523
00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:54,376
Right now it pays the bills.

524
00:26:54,453 --> 00:26:56,580
I mean, my sights are set
on a college professorship.

525
00:26:56,655 --> 00:26:58,646
Maybe a nice cushy tenure
somewhere small.

526
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:00,351
Were you working on Monday?

527
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:01,790
No.

528
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,122
Where were you all day?

529
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:05,186
I was home doing
a Iesson plan. Why?

530
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:07,458
Now, you only teach
high school kids?

531
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:08,556
It's safer that way.

532
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:11,159
My teaching methods
are considered
a Iittle unorthodox.

533
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:14,933
Is that because
you get too familiar
with the student body?

534
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:17,201
You've been talking
to the principal.

535
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:19,539
See, he hasn't changed
the curricula since the '70s.

536
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:22,808
If you want to reach the kids,
you to have to meet them
at their Ievel.

537
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:25,441
And partying with them
does that for you?

538
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:28,749
Where's this coming from?
I don't party
with my students.

539
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,788
Really?
Then what were you doing
at the Kessler apartment

540
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:32,619
a couple nights ago?

541
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,950
Relieving parental concerns.

542
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:37,120
So you're a chaperone?

543
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:40,858
Yes, I've done it before.
Mia asks me to cover
so her friends can attend,

544
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:42,695
because the mother
isn't capable.

545
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:46,602
A witness put drugs
and alcohol at this party.
Where were you?

546
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,767
No one did anything
Iike that in front of me.

547
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,501
For a chaperone,
you're not very observant.

548
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:53,772
Well, I also don't have eyes
in the back of my head,
Detective.

549
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,643
I mean, Iisten. If the kids
want to do something,
they're going to find a way.

550
00:27:56,715 --> 00:28:00,276
Were you aware
that there were
14-year-old minors there?

551
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:04,311
Sure. Mia has to watch
her brother
'cause of the home situation,

552
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:08,816
and she said that he could
have friends in his room,
to keep him quiet,

553
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:10,794
but they weren't
any of my responsibility.

554
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:13,262
How do you explain
the hits of ecstasy
you gave them?

555
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:14,958
They Iied to you.

556
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:18,432
Kids tend to do that
when their backs
are against a wall.

557
00:28:18,503 --> 00:28:19,868
Adults, too.

558
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:29,102
We've got nothing
to tie him to the assault.

559
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:31,706
You said that we needed
a corroborating statement
to pursue the drugs.

560
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,182
What about the other boy,
Nick Radsen?

561
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:34,309
Not good enough.

562
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:37,446
He was a recipient
of Cynthia's services.
I would argue intent.

563
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:39,422
Well, that puts us back
at square one.

564
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:42,051
Call me when you
get something.

565
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:45,062
Cynthia was just released
from the hospital.

566
00:28:45,397 --> 00:28:47,297
Persuading her to talk
is not going to be easy.

567
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:50,266
Tell her what you know.
Give her details.
It might force her hand.

568
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:52,701
EIIiot, have a sit down
with the parents.

569
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:56,265
You can't tell them
about the rape, but you can
tell them what we do here.

570
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:04,575
Public health official's
been here three times.

571
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,140
He wants a Iist of names.

572
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:11,184
So he went to Amy and
she's so scared she spilled
her guts about sex parties.

573
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:13,589
Fourteen-year-old sex parties,
for God's sake.

574
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,752
Amy's parents blame Cynthia,

575
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:18,490
so now she's Iost
her best friend
along with everything else.

576
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:20,691
Neither one of you
could have prevented this.

577
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,428
What the hell
do you know about it?

578
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:26,666
I'm a detective
that works sex crimes.
My squad, all we handle

579
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:29,173
are sexually based crimes.

580
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:33,406
Child abuse, abandonment,
and rape cases.

581
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:40,842
You're saying
my Iittle girl was raped?

582
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,979
Law's pretty clear
about what I can and can't do.

583
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:48,584
Let's just say,
hypothetically, if a
14 year-old girl were raped,

584
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,757
and she doesn't want to report
it, I can't investigate it.

585
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,390
I can't make an arrest.

586
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:58,164
Cynthia was raped
and won't talk?

587
00:29:58,237 --> 00:29:59,704
Is that what you're saying?

588
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,070
I'm not allowed
to answer that question.

589
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:13,108
This is good news.

590
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,380
What?

591
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:18,253
How can you bring yourself
to think that,
much Iess say it?

592
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:21,293
If Cynthia got gonorrhea
from being raped,

593
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,818
then it wasn't her fault.
She didn't do anything wrong.

594
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:30,997
CYNTHIA: What's
gonna happen now?

595
00:30:31,337 --> 00:30:32,634
Nothing.

596
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,229
Even though I know
what happened that night,

597
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:36,741
I still can't do anything
if you won't talk.

598
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,572
You know?

599
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:40,111
Yeah, most of it.

600
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:44,874
I know that Tommy
makes you do things that
you probably don't want to.

601
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:47,181
That's not true. I Iove Tommy.

602
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:52,454
Well, I know
that he traded you
to a man for drugs.

603
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:55,652
Now, that doesn't sound to me
Iike he cares about you
very much.

604
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,526
Tommy wouldn't do that.
He's my boyfriend.

605
00:30:59,098 --> 00:31:02,192
The most popular guy in school
and he picked me.

606
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:05,435
And that's important to you?
Being part of the in crowd?

607
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:06,801
It's everything.

608
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:09,433
But it's not worth
your safety or your health.

609
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:11,203
Well, it doesn't matter now.

610
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:13,142
My parents know
about the parties.

611
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,611
My dad won't even Iook at me.
I think he hates me.

612
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:19,480
Cynthia, your dad
doesn't hate you.

613
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,076
He's just upset.

614
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:24,145
They just want
what's best for you.

615
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,321
Look at my mom.

616
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:28,952
She's beautiful.
If I Iooked Iike her...

617
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:31,929
There's nothing wrong
with the way you Iook.

618
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,855
You are beautiful, too.

619
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,366
Right. On the inside.

620
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:39,497
Pretty girls always say that
to make the ugly ones
feel better.

621
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:42,097
Everyone has doubts
and problems,

622
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:44,574
even the ones in the so-called
popular crowd.

623
00:31:44,644 --> 00:31:46,043
Not from where I'm sitting.

624
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,809
Your friends
are scared and in pain,
just Iike you, Cynthia.

625
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:53,545
But they don't have
half of your resilience
and half of your courage.

626
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:54,711
Sure.

627
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:58,689
You were raped and you went
to that hospital
all by yourself.

628
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:00,055
Do you know
that there are grown women

629
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,720
who couldn't
cope with that situation
the way you have?

630
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,025
Really?
Yeah, really.

631
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:11,093
Now, all you have to do
is say the word
and we will go get him.

632
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,774
I don't know.

633
00:32:21,414 --> 00:32:26,852
We don't have to take care
of this right now, but I want
you to think about it, okay?

634
00:32:34,226 --> 00:32:36,194
It was the teacher.

635
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:42,059
Ross McKenzie. He raped me.

636
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:49,000
MCKENZIE:
Hamlet was a eunuch. His...

637
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:51,741
I hope this can wait.

638
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:54,803
Sorry to disappoint you,
but you have an appointment
with a needle.

639
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,347
What, you want my blood?
What for?

640
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:58,077
To match your DNA
to a rape kit.

641
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:02,180
Mr. Charest, this is a
mistake. They've got the wrong
guy. I never raped anyone.

642
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:04,951
Save your energy
for the school board,
Mr. McKenzie.

643
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,425
I've already started
the paperwork to fire you.

644
00:33:07,494 --> 00:33:08,722
I want to call my Iawyer.

645
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:11,093
Just so Iong as she isn't 14.

646
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:19,906
My client
never touched the girl,
so the DNA won't match.

647
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:22,669
Well, then he should be
more than ready to tell us
what happened at the party.

648
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:26,577
He doesn't have to say a word.
As soon as your Iab confirms
it, we're walking out.

649
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:28,876
We'II just keep coming back
till we get some answers.

650
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:31,383
At the school, to your home,
the board of education.

651
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:33,078
I think you get the picture.

652
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:35,485
You'II just force me
to file a harassment suit,
Detective.

653
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,955
Who said anything about
harassing your client?
That would be wrong.

654
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:40,357
Ross, you've got a drug habit.

655
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:44,659
Do you really want
all this attention when you're
going to make your next buy?

656
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:53,965
Go ahead, tell them.
They can't charge you
with anything.

657
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,668
There's no proof.

658
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,908
I gave up two tabs of ex,
hoping to get some action.

659
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:01,948
The girl freaked out
and wouldn't do it.
I never Iaid a finger on her.

660
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:04,415
You tried to prey
on a 14-year-old girl.

661
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:07,385
I was high, and, from what I
could see, she wasn't
into the word "no".

662
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:11,117
Bear in mind you can't
charge my client
with intent to rape.

663
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:13,125
Who else was Cynthia with
that night?

664
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:15,024
She never Ieft Tommy
and Nick's side.

665
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,528
If she was really raped,

666
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,928
it was probably
one of them who did it.

667
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,899
He's sticking to his story.
CIaims he never touched her.

668
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:28,771
He didn't. His DNA came back
negative. The real question
is, was she raped?

669
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:31,108
I still believe she was.

670
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,770
Then why Iie
about the teacher?

671
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:35,007
Because she desperately
wants to belong.

672
00:34:35,082 --> 00:34:39,109
She points at Tommy or Nick,
she's out of
the popular crowd.

673
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,187
That's taking peer pressure
to the extreme.

674
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:44,485
I am really getting sick
of these kids, which is
probably why I don't have any.

675
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:45,855
Round them up and Iean hard.

676
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:48,656
Captain, Cynthia's still
a rape victim.

677
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,428
Who Iied to the police,

678
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:53,398
severely compromising
any trial on her behalf.

679
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,933
Once she opted to speak,
she set the ball in motion.

680
00:34:57,003 --> 00:35:01,303
Interview rooms one,
two and my office,
with their parents, now.

681
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:07,042
Tommy told detectives
he gave Cynthia to you
for your birthday.

682
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:08,274
Is that right?

683
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:09,508
Yes.

684
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:12,017
Nick, no.
What were you thinking?

685
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,814
Cynthia go with you
willingly?

686
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:14,911
Eventually.

687
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,615
STABLER: Where did you two go
to be alone?

688
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,089
Tommy's room.

689
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:21,287
She said no but he insisted.

690
00:35:21,962 --> 00:35:24,226
So what happened
when the door closed?

691
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:27,027
We talked for a while.
We have a Iot in common.

692
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,931
We're both good in school.
We Iove computers.

693
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,196
We Iike to read.

694
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:34,001
It kills me that he treats her
Iike a slave.

695
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:39,036
I'm gonna get
right to the point,
Mr. and Mrs. Wilmont.

696
00:35:39,112 --> 00:35:41,103
Your daughter Iied to us.

697
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:44,743
She wouldn't do that.
She was raped.

698
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:48,384
Right now, I'm not questioning
whether or not she was raped.

699
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:50,047
She Iied about who did it.

700
00:35:50,123 --> 00:35:51,750
I don't understand.

701
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:57,496
You think a teacher
who attends kids' parties
is innocent?

702
00:35:57,564 --> 00:36:01,466
The man is guilty
of questionable ethics
but he's not a rapist.

703
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:04,595
His DNA didn't match
your daughter's rape kit.

704
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:10,002
Speak up, Cynthia.

705
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:19,113
Young Iady, you are not going
anywhere until I find out
who you're protecting.

706
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,719
Is it your boyfriend, Tommy?
No.

707
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:26,225
He admitted to giving you
to this teacher for drugs.

708
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:29,652
Did he get angry
when you wouldn't do it?

709
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:32,126
Did he threaten you?

710
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:34,463
What the hell's going on here?

711
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,399
Are you saying
my daughter's a prostitute?

712
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:40,462
What I'm saying is
that I believe she would
do anything for this boy.

713
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:43,370
I don't believe it.

714
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,581
DAVID: You made me leave work
for this? This isn't a crime,

715
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,486
MUNCH: Your son's been
engaging in unprotected sex,

716
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,926
DAVID: Come on,
the boy's just curious,

717
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:06,022
He had an itch, He got
it scratched, Good for him,

718
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,090
Tommy's a little pimp,

719
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:11,797
He trades his girlfriend's
services for alcohol
and drugs.

720
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:16,131
MUNCH: Someone raped Cynthia
at the Iast party
and we want to know who.

721
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,978
That true?
Don't you Iie to me.

722
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:26,349
Cynthia does the guys
that I tell her to.

723
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:28,848
I don't force her.

724
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,617
TOMMY: I don't have to,

725
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:34,893
DAVID: Why would you do this?
I don't know,

726
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:41,190
I guess because all the
really pretty girls,
they don't put out, She does,

727
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:47,533
She does what I tell her
to do, to whoever I say,
whenever I want,

728
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:07,851
He said Nick had never been
with a girl before,

729
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:12,822
and that it was his birthday,
and if I really Ioved him,

730
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,832
I would do this
for his friend.

731
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,575
So you go into the room
with him?

732
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,843
He was telling corny jokes.
He was being really sweet.

733
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:33,818
But I still didn't want to.
I mean, how could I?

734
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:36,381
I'm Tommy's girl.

735
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:40,351
Is that when it turned ugly?

736
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:50,536
BENSON: You must've hated her.

737
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:52,594
No, I Iike her.

738
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,800
Cynthia's too smart
to be used by that clown.
Tommy's Iame.

739
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:58,174
STABLER: And that's what
pisses you off.

740
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:02,207
He's the one
getting all the attention,
the girls, the glory.

741
00:39:02,283 --> 00:39:04,615
That's not how it is.
He's my friend.

742
00:39:04,685 --> 00:39:08,052
No, he's not. He gives you
his Ieftovers, man.

743
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,514
I mean, that's got to
burn you, knowing that
he's not in your Ieague.

744
00:39:12,593 --> 00:39:14,424
You think
Tommy's beneath you.

745
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:18,522
But he's the most
popular guy in school.
That's why Cynthia Iikes him.

746
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,829
That's why Cynthia
wouldn't give you
the time of day,

747
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,732
and that's why
you had to take
what you wanted.

748
00:39:22,803 --> 00:39:25,203
I've heard enough.
We're Ieaving.

749
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:32,436
She started to cry,
Iike being with me
was so awful.

750
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:39,380
I told her I'd tell Tommy
and then she Iaid down, but...

751
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:43,581
Then she changed her mind.
Girls can't do that.

752
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:48,990
Then what happened?

753
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:51,892
Nothing.

754
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:59,532
Well, you had sex, didn't you?

755
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:03,136
She Iet me do it.

756
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,270
She fight you?

757
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:11,985
She said no
but she just Iaid there.

758
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:21,291
Afterwards, she said we'd
never talk about it again.

759
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:23,629
Is that why you beat her up?

760
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:25,528
'Cause you thought she'd come
and talk to us?

761
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,399
No. She gave me the clap
and she didn't even apologize.

762
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:31,494
So you followed her home?

763
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,401
After baseball practice,
she accused me of rape,

764
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,538
and that pissed me off,
'cause that just
didn't happen.

765
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:44,315
If she wants Tommy,
she can have him.
He's a Ioser.

766
00:40:44,518 --> 00:40:46,145
So are you, Nick.
