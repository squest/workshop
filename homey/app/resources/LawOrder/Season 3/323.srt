to have them.

Luckily it's built
out of stone.

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,036
Purse and panties
are gone.

Excuse me, Father.

My Latin never got much past

amo, amas, amat,
Maybe you can help me
with this.

36
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,343
Does that mean
"I have sinned?"

00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:28,875
Did you know this boy,
Father?

38
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,883
I had never saw him before.

39
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,346
Father, we're gonna need you
to come down to the precinct

40
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:37,153
and make a statement for us.
Of course.

So the perp
meets the victim.

Maybe he knows
he's a transvestite,
maybe not.

43
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,360
Well, if he didn't,
that'd definitely be enough
to set him off.

00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:51,930
They come in here to trick,
perp sodomizes him
and kills him,

decorates his body,
then gives him a funeral pyre.

46
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:58,438
Why go to all the trouble
and then try to cover it up?

47
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:01,677
He's in a church,
he feels guilty.

48
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:06,454
He tells God he's sorry
and then he tries
to burn away the sin.

49
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,198
Bruising to the thighs, small
anal tears, but the attack
wasn't particularly violent.

50
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:03,537
Cause of death,
massive hemorrhage
from a skull fracture.

51
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:05,976
Any ideas
about the murder weapon?

52

WARNER: BIunt trauma
to the temple

53
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:11,782
caused by something round
and heavy Iike an iron bar
or flashlight.

54
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:14,854
But the fracture pattern
on the occiput is diffused.

55
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:17,085
He cracked his head
on the floor
when he fell back?

56
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,753
WARNER: Probably.
You got anything on our perp?

57
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,788
He didn't practice safe rape.
We got fluids.
We're running his DNA.

58
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,725
Any chance of getting prints
off the body?

59
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:30,829
He was wearing
surgical gloves. We found
traces of Iatex and powder.

60
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:32,874
No condom,
but he was wearing gloves?

61
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:35,103
You think that's weird,

62
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:38,943
I found traces of
sodium dichlorotriazinetrione
inside him.

63
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:42,379
It's the main cleaning agent
in scouring powder.

64
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:46,114
And this,
small fragments of steel wool.

65
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:49,055
Our perp used both
to scrub his penis.

66
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,356
So he's really clean.
And really dirty.

67
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,122
I found the body
when I came down to prepare
for 6:00 mass.

68
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,496
That's early.

69
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:02,003
There's nothing Iike
a hit of God before you
do battle on Wall Street.

70
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:05,234
Still, it seems Iike
a pretty rough area to Ieave
the side door unlocked.

71
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:08,038
Well, the church is supposed
to be a refuge.

72
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,601
This morning I asked
if you knew the victim.

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,113
You didn't seem surprised
he was a boy.

74
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:16,117
Well, when you serve
in this part of town,
you see almost everything.

75
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:18,585
So you never saw him before?
No.

76
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:22,587
But there is someone
in the trenches
who might have.

77
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,796
FIN: We're thinking
maybe he crossed your path.

78
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:30,696
PEG: Oh, dear Lord. Jamie.

79
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,757
He's dead?
You know him?

80
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:37,628
James Doyle, 16 years old,
called himself Jamie.

81
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,906
Ran away from home when
his folks tried to Iock him up
in a treatment center.

82
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:45,538
How Iong has he been
coming down here?
Four, five months.

83
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:48,845
Trying to earn enough
for a sex change.
Trannies make good money.

84
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:51,182
Any reason why you think
he'd end up at Saint Martha's?

85
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:52,743
That's where he died?

86
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:55,814
He went in there
to do business. Priest Ieft
the side door open.

87
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:59,418
Father Michael always Ieaves
the church open for the pros
when it's cold and wet.

88
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:01,122
But they know
not to do business there.

89
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:05,600
What's this
Father Michael Iike?
He's a good priest
and a good man.

90
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:10,431
Anything else you can tell me
about who did this
so I can warn folk?

91
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:14,272
Yeah. He's very particular
about his personal hygiene.

92
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:16,607
(SNICKERING)
He should stand out a mile.

93
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:21,440
VICAP can't find
any direct matches
for the M.O. or signature.

94
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:23,849
Just a partial out in EI Paso,

95
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,353
man murdered his wife,
Ieft her body in the church.

96
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,583
Don't tell me,
where they were married.
Yep.

97
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:31,854
And now he's sitting
on death row
so he's not much good to us.

98
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:33,019
You know, maybe
this is the first time

99
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:36,394
the place didn't burn
and the body's been preserved.

100
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,024
No one's actually ever seen
these Iittle rituals.

101
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:42,502
I'II ask VICAP
to widen the search
to all arson-related deaths

102
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,096
and cross-check with crimes
against transsexuals
and transvestites.

103
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:47,802
Warner got a DNA match.
One Mr. Gus Yoder.

104
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:51,779
Just paroled from Attica.
Did four years for guess what?
Arson.

105
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:03,691
What is this?
Gus Yoder?

106
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,056
What do you want?

107
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,220
The skinny
on your relationship
with Jamie Doyle.

108
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,524
I don't know no Jamie Doyle.

109
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:12,431
You always wear those gloves?
Customers don't Iike prints
on the glass.

110
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,695
Tell us about it
at the precinct.

111
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:18,331
PIease. Don't touch me.
I'II go where you want,
but don't touch me.

112
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:22,571
Looks Iike we got us a racist.
I'm a Jew.
Is that better or worse?

113
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:27,011
Haven't you heard of safe sex,
Mr. Yoder?
Of course I have.

114
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,846
Then why'd you Ieave millions
of Iittle Yoders
inside of Jamie Doyle?

115
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,184
We got a DNA match, Gus.
We know you were with him.

116
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,356
I didn't touch him.
Sodomy doesn't count
as touching?

117
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:37,790
I didn't do that.

118
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,885
Come on. You thought
Jamie was a cute Iittle trick

119
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:41,395
till he showed you
his surprise package.

120
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:43,523
And that pissed you off
and you cracked his skull.

121
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,829
Or maybe you Iike Iittle boys,
as Iong as they
Iook Iike girls.

122
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:48,028
GUS: No.
Sit down, Gus,
you're making me nervous.

123
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,627
I'm not sitting there,
it's disgusting.

124
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,696
It's a chair.
It's filthy.

125
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:54,572
Think of all the scum
that have sat there.
Yeah, you for one.

126
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:58,909
I can't breathe in here.
I wanna go home.
Not till we're finished.

127
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:01,141
We're searching your place,
Gus.

128
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:04,152
Is that where we're gonna
find Jamie Doyle's purse,
maybe his panties?

129
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,087
AII right. So I picked him up.
I had sex with him.

130
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:09,784
But he was alive
when he got out of my car.

131
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:18,699
He tightens his sphincter
any more,
he's gonna implode.

132
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:22,635
OCD. He probably
washes his hands
about 50 times a day.

133
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:25,333
Let me have a Iook
at the crime scene.

134
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,234
HUANG: What's this?

135
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:29,174
BENSON: It's a rosary.
His?

136
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:31,873
Priest said it came from
one of the statues
in the church.

137
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:34,415
And it's right
around his neck,
not just placed there?

138
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:37,418
It's right around. Why?
It's not Yoder.

139
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:40,649
There's no way
that he'd go near a dead body
or touch blood.

140
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:43,123
The guy has unprotected sex
with a male prostitute.

141
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,285
You can't tell me
he's squeamish.
He is.

142
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:48,353
After he has sex,
he wants to get as far away
from his partner as possible.

143
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,921
Or he feels dirty
and he kills him.

144
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:55,662
What's this?
That's Latin for
"I have sinned"'

145
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:59,604
I checked it with the priest.
Well, he's wrong.

146
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:03,873
"I have sinned" is Peccavi,
Peccavisti is
"You have sinned"'

147
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:07,211
This isn't a confession,
it's an accusation.
Against the victim?

148
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,148
Burning the confessional,
carving "You have sinned,"

149
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:11,846
seem more Iike acts of rage
against the Church
and the priest.

150
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:15,516
So Jamie's death is what,
an accident?
It could be.

151
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:18,583
The altar cloth, the candles,
the rosary beads,

152
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,787
you can't say
they're accidental.

153
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:24,322
But they were all done
post mortem.
The kill itself is accidental.

154
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,799
Yes, our man killed Jamie,

155
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,894
but the ritualistic elements
seem Iike acts of contrition.

156
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:33,567
So he was attacking
the priest, and Jamie just
happened to get in the way.

157
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:36,907
And if the killer had a grudge
against the priest,

158
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,743
there's a good chance
that Father Michael knows him.

159
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:43,979
Check the Father's background,
see if he's been keeping
bad company.

160
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:45,714
Yes, I'm still on hold.

161
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,779
Okay. Thank you for that.

162
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:52,158
That was the secretary from
Saint Thomas's Catholic School
in Hoboken.

163
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,388
Father Michael
used to teach there.

164
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:57,864
October 1996 he Ieft abruptly,
right in the middle of a term.

165
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:58,991
What was the reason given?

166
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:01,730
She says she doesn't know
for sure, but according
to the rumor mill,

167
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:03,829
a priest abused some boys,
he was then removed.

168
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:04,998
And the case
never came to trial.

169
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:07,508
Far as she's heard
it was never even reported.

170
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:10,044
I'II get Munch and Fin
to check
with the Hoboken cops.

171
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,374
You two talk to Father Michael

172
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:14,575
before the Church
gets wind of this
and removes him again.

173
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,242
EIIiot.
Not a problem, Captain.

174
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:19,549
Well, if it becomes one,
you can take a back seat.

175
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:25,452
You know, I try to be
a good Catholic, raise my kids
as good Catholics.

176
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,757
Something Iike this
shakes your faith. I know.

177
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,425
If I didn't see
through this guy,
how could a 14-year-old?

178
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,394
How could an eight-year-old?

179
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,108
Hello, Detectives.

180
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,878
We need to ask you
some more questions, Father.

181
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:51,843
AII right.

182
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
I'd Iike to know
why you Iied to me.

183
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:58,457
About what?
The message
on the confessional.

184
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,462
The correct translation is
"You have sinned"'

185
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:07,834
Well, I'm very sorry.
I was never very good
at Latin.

186
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:11,903
Or maybe you're the sinner.
Well, who isn't, Detective?

187
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:13,965
BENSON:
Where were you Iast night?

188
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,837
I was with a parishioner.

189
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,848
I was helping him
through a midnight crisis.

190
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,440
Give us a name.

191
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,578
I can't.
BENSON: Why?

192
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:30,148
Because he confessed
to the murder?
You know better than
to ask me that.

193
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,525
STABLER:
Saint Thomas's School,
October '96.

194
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:38,157
There are rumors that a priest
sexually abused some boys.

195
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,134
Was it you?

196
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:49,069
Tell us what happened
or we'II just get it
from the Hoboken police.

197
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,604
I signed
a confidentiality agreement.

198
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,045
What planet
you been Iiving on, Father?

199
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:55,879
Confidentiality agreements
won't hold up
in a criminal court.

200
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,350
Evening mass starts
in 20 minutes.

201
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,444
If you're going to charge me
with something, charge me.

202
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:01,489
Otherwise, please Ieave.

203
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,859
Saint Thomas's School?

204
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:12,025
That's one I'd rather forget.
Why?

205
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:15,070
(TV CHATTERING)
The case never went anywhere.
Nobody wanted it to.

206
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:16,365
Sit. Sit.

207
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:19,737
So, how'd you catch it?
Somebody make a complaint?

208
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:22,106
Oh, not at the school,
the ER.

209
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:24,270
Kid falls off his bike,

210
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:28,112
doctor finds something else,
bruising around his backside.

211
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:31,950
I check out the parents.
They're clean.
Yeah, and?

212
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,512
Well, the kid's a student
at Saint Tom's.
I dig a Iittle deeper.

213
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,786
I find four boys
who say they were molested.

214
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,852
By the same priest?
Well, the stories varied.

215
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:44,194
Kids didn't want
to give names.
MUNCH: What, they were scared?

216
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:48,225
Maybe, because
just as I was getting close,
the Church steps in,

217
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:51,602
settles with the families
for 200 grand each.

218
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:54,403
Why didn't you push harder?
Try to convince the families?

219
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:55,807
You don't think I tried?

220
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:59,143
No case,
no complaining witnesses,
what could I do?

221
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:04,346
Moresco took a Iot of notes,
but never filed a report.

222
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,717
That was the alumni office
at Saint Tom's.

223
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,316
One of the boys moved
to Europe, two of them
are still in the area.

224
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:12,587
Todd Ramsay
on the Upper West Side

225
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:16,119
and Ben Campion
works three blocks
from Father Michael's church.

226
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:18,598
Well, you'd think
he'd try to be as far away
from him as possible.

227
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,396
Let's take him.

228
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:22,096
We'II take Ramsay.
What about the fourth kid?

229
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,763
Yeah. Bobby Douglas.
Don't know.

230
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,173
AIumni office said
that he severed all ties
as soon as he Ieft the school.

231
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:34,141
Monday night I was here.
I got an apartment
on the top floor.

232
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:37,652
Were you alone?
Just me and my TV.
What's this about?

233
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:41,485
We wanted to ask you
about Saint Tom's,
October '96.

234
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:47,153
We heard you made allegations
against one of the priests.

235
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,024
I've put that behind me.

236
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,088
But you've remained close
with Father Michael.

237
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,724
He was at Saint Tom's, right?
Yeah.

238
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:55,133
Father Mike invited me
to run this place
after college.

239
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:58,605
That was kind of him.
That's how he is.
He Iikes to help people.

240
00:13:58,674 --> 00:13:58,268
He set this place up
to get the kids
off the street, you know.

241
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,244
Did Father Michael abuse you
at Saint Tom's?

242
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:05,009
No way. No.
He never touched me.

243
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,612
And how is he
with the kids here now?

244
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:09,551
He doesn't
come around here much anymore.

245
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:11,589
For the past year
I've pretty much
run the place.

246
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:14,090
But if there ever is a problem
with a kid, he's always there.

247
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,889
STABLER: For what?
Not for what you're thinking.

248
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,361
Excuse me.

249
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:23,424
I'm not going to be part
of your witch hunt.

250
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:25,469
Come on, guys. Let's go!

251
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:28,495
MUNCH: Mr. Ramsay?
Who are you?

252
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,766
Detectives Munch and Tutuola,
Special Victims.

253
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:34,778
How can I help you?
Do you know
Father Michael Sweeney?

254
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:35,835
I knew him at school.

255
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:39,406
Not since then?
No, and I'm not
saying anything else.

256
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:40,917
Why not?

257
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:44,149
Confidentiality agreement.
They paid, I shut up.

258
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,324
It doesn't have to end there.
Forget it.

259
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:49,155
So a pervy priest put his hand
on my ass...

260
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:51,320
Todd!
...I'm not gonna Iet it
ruin my Iife.

261
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,420
It's okay, Judi.
We're going.

262
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:56,296
FIN: Where were you
Monday night?
Home with my wife.

263
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:59,633
New kid,
so we don't get out much.
What is this about?

264
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:01,729
MUNCH:
Do you know Bobby Douglas?

265
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:05,799
We stayed in touch for a while
till he started weirding out.

266
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:07,435
Look, I haven't seen him
for a couple of years.

267
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,980
You have any idea
where he Iives?

268
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,916
MUNCH: Bobby Douglas?
Yes.

269
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,378
What can I do for you,
Officers?

270
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,822
We spoke to your mom.
She said we could find you
down here.

271
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:23,622
I help out
when I can take a break
from my studies.

272
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,960
Do you know
Father Michael Sweeney?
Name sounds familiar.

273
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:29,967
Well, he taught
at Saint Thomas'.
Didn't you go to school there?

274
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:31,593
I've had a Iot of teachers.

275
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,571
You told the school
to take a hike after they
wrote you a big fat check.

276
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,166
Something must've happened.
I don't want to talk about it.

277
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:40,370
Did you study Latin, Father?

278
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:42,946
It's required at seminary.

279
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:46,211
What does Peccavisti mean?
I don't remember.

280
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:48,518
How about Monday night,
you remember that?

281
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:49,951
I was studying.

282
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:51,181
Where,
at Saint Martha's Church?

283
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:53,622
So you could Ieave
Father Michael a message?

284
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,683
No.
Do you remember him?

285
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,661
Oh, my God.

286
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,730
I could've been a good priest,

287
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:07,134
but he ruined me,
he took away my Iife.

288
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:09,335
Who did?

289
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:14,334
Father Michael.
I had to expose him.

290
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,240
MUNCH: So you tried
to burn down his church?

291
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,474
He had sinned.

292
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:30,791
Bobby was at
the homeless shelter Monday
night. What is this about?

293
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:34,263
There was a crime committed
and we just want to make
sure Bobby wasn't involved.

294
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,527
We have a warrant
to search your son's room,
Mrs. Douglas.

295
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:37,898
Where is it?

296
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:40,233
Down the hall on the Ieft.

297
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:42,102
Bobby wouldn't do
anything wrong.

298
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:44,869
What time did he come home
on Monday?
After midnight.

299
00:16:44,943 --> 00:16:47,343
I was asleep, but I woke up
when I heard him on the phone.

300
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:50,040
Who was he talking to?
I don't know.

301
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:52,242
Did you hear anything else?

302
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:57,413
At 3:00 I woke up again.
I heard voices.

303
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,253
I came downstairs
but it was only
Father Michael.

304
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:03,158
Bobby told me
to go back to bed,
that everything was okay.

305
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:05,389
Does Father Michael
come around a Iot?

306
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:09,456
Well, yes especially
with Bobby trying
to get into the seminary.

307
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,736
You mean
he's not a priest already?
Oh, of course not.

308
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:18,037
You can't be a priest
unless you've been accepted
by the seminary.

309
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,736
FIN: We got something.

310
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,544
Excuse me.

311
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,915
MUNCH: He's got a thing
for virgins
and a thing for purses.

312
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:29,647
We found this in the trash.
It belongs to Jamie Doyle.

313
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:32,383
It's got 250 bucks in it
and a dozen condoms.

314
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:35,187
Looks Iike
Mr. Freaky-CIean Yoder's
in the clear.

315
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,390
This was in the closet.
Tech sprayed Iuminol on it.
Hit the Iights.

316
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,967
BENSON: BIood?
FIN: Yeah.

317
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:46,002
And what Iooks Iike skin.

318
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:53,368
BENSON: Your mom said that
Father Michael came over
in the middle of the night.

319
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:56,573
Must've been
a pretty big deal?
Not really.

320
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:59,674
Well, it sounds Iike
you wanted to get something
off your chest.

321
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:01,184
No.
No?

322
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:02,512
No.

323
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,593
You killed him
with the flashlight
that we found in your room.

324
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:14,697
But you treated him
with respect.

325
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,059
You covered him up,

326
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:21,738
Iit the candles,
those rosary beads
you gave him.

327
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:23,967
I mean, obviously you cared.

328
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:27,370
I said I was sorry
and I was forgiven.

329
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,943
In confession?
Yes.

330
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:35,184
You confessed
to Father Michael.

331
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:37,619
That's between me and God.

332
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:41,352
I did my penance.
Yeah and what's that?
Ten Hail Mary's?

333
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:47,893
You haven't asked
Jamie Doyle's family
for forgiveness, have you?

334
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,764
I can't face them.
Then Iet us help you.

335
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,534
Tell us what happened.

336
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,802
Oh, I'd already
started the fire.

337
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:03,439
I didn't know he was there.

338
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:06,314
He came up behind me.

339
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,648
He startled me,
I swung the flashlight.

340
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:14,157
He went down.
BIood started pouring.
He didn't move.

341
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:15,419
(DOOR OPENING)

342
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:19,392
This interview is over.
His mother called me.

343
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:21,329
We have a confession,
Counselor.

344
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,128
Well, you don't have it
in writing,

345
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:27,035
and you won't get it,
unless I get to talk terms
with the A.D.A.

346
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:31,332
Why should I deal?

347
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:34,572
I've got his confession,
and a murder weapon
with his prints all over it.

348
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:35,943
Stick a fork in him,
Kressler.

349
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:39,074
He's a victim of abuse,
working out his rage
against the Church

350
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,242
that ruined his Iife.

351
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:43,082
Jamie Doyle
was not the Church.
He was an innocent victim.

352
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:45,850
He was a transvestite hooker,
fresh from a trick

353
00:19:45,924 --> 00:19:48,415
and in Iight
of the psychological damage
inflicted on Bobby.

354
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:50,393
Once I'm through
with the jury,
he won't serve a day.

355
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:53,658
He killed a 16-year-old boy
who caught him
trying to burn down a church.

356
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,358
I could try that in my sleep.

357
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:58,197
The second the jury
hears the words
priest and abuse,

358
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,931
whose side do you think
they'II be on?

359
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,407
Man two. Eight-to-10.

360
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:05,704
In this climate Bobby could
have torched a kindergarten

361
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:07,438
and a jury would
still be sympathetic.

362
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:10,606
Man two, five years probation
with psych treatment.

363
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:12,673
Man two, five years
Kirby Psychiatric,

364
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,911
and that depends on
what he has to tell us.

365
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:19,279
There was this room
in the basement

366
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:22,292
next to where they kept
the sports equipment.

367
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,561
Father Michael
called it the Lair.

368
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:31,068
He said that boys went in
as Iambs
and came out as Iions.

369
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:36,865
He'd call me in there
after practice
for extra tutoring.

370
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:41,975
He'd show me videos.
CABOT: What sort of videos?

371
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:45,742
At first just sports.
Then porn.

372
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,511
What sort of porn?

373
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:51,353
AII sorts.

374
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:56,018
Some with women,
some with boys.

375
00:20:57,595 --> 00:21:00,428
He'd say
I shouldn't be embarrassed,

376
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:03,292
that how I was feeling
was normal.

377
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,731
Did he touch you?

378
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,602
He'd put his arm around me.

379
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:17,105
He'd stroke my Iegs.

380
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:21,381
Say I had good, strong thighs.

381
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:24,448
How old were you, Bobby?

382
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:27,185
Fourteen.

383
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:32,821
What else did he do to you?

384
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:37,792
Said I had to pass a test.

385
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:40,434
What test?

386
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,105
I had...

387
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:54,246
I had to masturbate.

388
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,283
He said he'd help me.

389
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,721
Then, I had to do him.

390
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:04,761
Afterwards, he said
I'd done well.

391
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:15,495
I'd made a mark in heaven.

392

RORY: Excuse me, Detectives.

394
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:32,185
Rory O'Halloran.
I represent the Diocese.

395
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:33,655
We have a warrant,
Mr. O'Halloran.

396
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,955
Oh, of course you do.
We'd just Iike a Iittle word.

397
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,324
STABLER: Who's we?

398
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:45,129
Your Grace, EIIiot Stabler.
Hi.

399
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:46,397
STABLER: OIivia Benson.

400
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:49,338
You know Bishop Mallinson?
Yes. Of course.
How can we help you?

401
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:53,776
Mr. O'Halloran says that
a search warrant has been
obtained for the rectory?

402
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:56,246
Why is that?
We suspect Father Michael
of child abuse.

403
00:22:56,315 --> 00:22:59,250
You should be more concerned
with Bobby Douglas

404
00:22:59,318 --> 00:23:01,684
and his vendetta
against Father Michael.

405
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:04,655
Why would Bobby
accuse Father Michael of abuse
if it weren't true?

406
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:07,317
Because Father Michael
prevented him
from joining the priesthood.

407
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:09,861
The priesthood
is under siege.

408
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:11,987
Fragile men have crumbled.
We need strength.

409
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:15,693
Father Michael has known Bobby
for years.
He felt he was immature.

410
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:19,465
Are you aware that he was
impersonating a priest when
your colleagues found him?

411
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:22,507
Feeding the homeless
is hardly a crime,
no matter what he was wearing.

412
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:25,634
I know my priests,
Detectives.

413
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:29,670
And believe me,
if I had anything
against Father Michael,

414
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:32,148
it would already be
in your hands.

415
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:35,119
But he's innocent.

416
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:38,588
I'm sorry, Your Grace,
we need to
execute this warrant.

Take this back to the Iab,
scan the hard drive.

420
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:55,806
I doubt we'd find any porn
on this. It's so ancient,
it hasn't got a modem.

421
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:57,908
Nice video collection.

422
00:23:57,976 --> 00:24:02,345
STABLER: Any pornography?
Mostly all sports. NBA, NHL.

423
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:04,839

THERAPIST: Are you attracted
to boys, Michael?
Yes,

427
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,230
What age?

428
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:28,199
Thirteen, 14 years old,

429
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:30,999
Tell me about your desires,

430
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:32,771
What's this?

431
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:35,746
Looks Iike some sort of
therapy session.

432
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:37,839
I want to see them naked,

433
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:44,219
In the showers,
at the youth club, I'll find
a reason to watch them,

434
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:47,457
Do you approach
these boys?
Yes,

435
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:52,255
If one shows interest,
a look is enough,

436
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:54,595
or if he seems vulnerable,

437
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:58,995
You feel a compulsion
to touch?

438
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:06,769
I try to resist, but I'm weak,

439
00:25:09,515 --> 00:25:12,643
I'll pat him on the back
or put my arm around him,

440
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:15,016
but I know I want more,

441
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:18,514
Genital contact?

442
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:21,715
Yes,

443
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,626
Is that a confession
or a statement of intent?

444
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:26,891
That sounds Iike
a confession to me.

445
00:25:26,965 --> 00:25:29,490
Actually, it's a part
of aversion therapy.

446
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:32,765
The subject relates
his fantasies, they're
recorded, edited into a Ioop

447
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:33,964
and played back for him

448
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,974
while he masturbates
for 30 minutes
past the point of climax.

449
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,772
That sounds painful.
It's supposed to be.

450
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:42,208
It's behavior modification.

451
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:45,546
The fantasies trigger
memories of pain,
instead of pleasure.

452
00:25:45,617 --> 00:25:47,278
BENSON: So does it work?

453
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:49,149
Nothing can change
a sex offender's desires.

454
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:50,279
Well, then why do it?

455
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:53,518
Father Michael can't
change his desires, but
he can try to control them.

456
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:57,028
That's what celibacy is
supposed to be all about,
controlling the desires,

457
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:59,586
channeling the sexual urge
into the Iove for God.

458
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:01,963
I thought celibacy was
a big part of the problem.

459
00:26:02,034 --> 00:26:06,027
Most celibate priests
are not sex offenders.
Our priest is.

460
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:08,265
Well, if he gives
into temptation
then you're right.

461
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,003
An alcoholic must avoid bars,
a pedophile must stay away
from children.

462
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:13,806
Well, an alcoholic
is still an alcoholic

463
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,938
and Father Michael
is still a pedophile.

464
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:18,949
Actually, he's an ephebophile.

465
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:21,042
He desires adolescents,
not children.

466
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,418
Whatever you call him,
they're still children
and he's still a predator.

467
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:27,754
The question is,
can you use this tape
to prove it?

468
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:33,927
No judge is going to Iet you
introduce that tape.

469
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,523
It's doctor-patient privilege.

470
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:39,401
He hid it in his home.
That sounds Iike a turn-on,
not therapy.

471
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:41,439
What he uses it for
doesn't alter what it is.

472
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:44,407
The tape substantiates
Bobby Douglas's accusations.

473
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:46,467
So what? You'II never
get it in as evidence.

474
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:47,978
We could argue
it shows intent.

475
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:50,981
To deal with his problem,
not to molest boys.

476
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:54,450
You've got Bobby Douglas
in Rikers Iooking Iike
a fruit Ioop,

477
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,783
and a tape that's privileged.
Your case is pathetic.

478
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:59,153
So your answer is
to do nothing?

479
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:02,716
My answer, Captain,
is that unless
I have bulletproof evidence,

480
00:27:02,794 --> 00:27:06,195
I am not jumping
on the bandwagon to crucify
the Catholic Church.

481
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:10,325
Nearly 200 priests
have been implicated
in cases of abuse so far.

482
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:14,634
Which is Iess than half
of one percent of the priests
in this country.

483
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:17,675
What we need is someone
to corroborate Bobby's story.

484
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:19,370
Another victim.

485
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:21,739
BEN: You want to
interview the boys?

486
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,974
Everyone between
the ages of 1 1 and 15

487
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,382
who's had any contact
with Father Michael Sweeney
before he Ieft the club.

488
00:27:27,452 --> 00:27:29,420
You need to ask the parents.
We'II do that.

489
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:32,082
Maybe you can answer
some questions for us,
Mr. Campion.

490
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:33,181
Like what?

491
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:35,658
You ever see Father Michael
show undue interest
in any one boy?

492
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:36,751
No.

493
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:39,228
Were there any boys
who always wanted to be
near him?

494
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:41,424
Half the club.
Does that mean
they're all abused?

495
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,024
What about boys acting up?

496
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:46,366
Personality changes,
mood swings, temper tantrums?

497
00:27:46,438 --> 00:27:48,565
PIenty.
They call it puberty.

498
00:27:48,774 --> 00:27:53,711
Well, have any of the boys
Ieft abruptly, or been absent
for Iong periods of time?

499
00:27:54,813 --> 00:27:57,247
Only one. Darius Retafian.

500
00:27:57,315 --> 00:28:01,149
He stopped coming, I suppose
it was around the same time
Father Michael Ieft.

501
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:02,982
Okay. You know why?

502
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:05,449
I called the mother.

503
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:09,016
She told me
to Ieave them alone,
and hung up.

504
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:12,457
BENSON: Mrs. Retafian?
Yes?

505
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:15,659
I'm Detective Benson,
this is my partner,
Detective Stabler.

506
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:18,259
Would you mind
if we come in?
Sure.

507
00:28:20,272 --> 00:28:22,866
We just wanted
to ask you about Darius.

508
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:27,204
Is he in trouble again?
Just wanna see
how he's doing.

509
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,247
He's all right, I guess.

510
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:31,612
Is this Darius?
Uh-huh.

511
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:36,747
My kid just started serving
as an altar boy.
It's a proud moment.

512
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:40,690
Can you tell us
why you pulled your son
out of the church youth club?

513
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:43,125
He just wasn't
fitting in there.

514
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:47,464
Did he have any contact
with Father Michael?

515
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:49,124
The priest?

516
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:52,295
Did he talk about him much,
anything Iike that?

517
00:28:55,574 --> 00:28:55,734
Yes.

518
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,202
(CHOIR SINGING)

519
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:03,346
Very good.

520
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:07,481
STABLER: Father Michael!
Yes?

521
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:11,388
We need you to come
with us, please.
Why?

522
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,521
Don't make us do this
in front of them.

523
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,528
Thank you all.
I'II see you next Thursday.

524
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,659
WOMAN: Goodbye,
Father Michael.
MAN: Good night, Father.

525
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,968
Am I under arrest?
For sexual abuse.

526
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,634
You have the right
to remain silent.

527
00:29:32,712 --> 00:29:35,510
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of Iaw.

528
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:36,775
You have the right
to an attorney.

529
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,578
COURT OFFICER:
"Docket number 28385.
People v, Michael Sweeney,

530
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,213
"Sex abuse two,
sex abuse three,
multiple counts"'

AIexandra Cabot
for the People.

532
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:47,082
Rory O'Halloran
for Father Sweeney.

533
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,652
JUDGE SELIGMAN:
How do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honor.

534
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,095
Ms. Cabot,
are you asking for bail?

535
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,929
The People request that bail
be set at $200,000.

536
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,129
Your Honor, that's punitive.
Father Michael has taken
a vow of poverty.

537
00:29:58,204 --> 00:29:59,501
He has no assets.

538
00:29:59,572 --> 00:30:02,336
The Church has
more than enough money
to meet his bail, Your Honor.

539
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:04,569
JUDGE SELIGMAN: The Defendant
has no priors, Ms. Cabot.

540
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:07,442
Why are you demanding
such a substantial bail?

541
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:08,775
In the Vatican's own words,

542
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:13,285
"The defendant is guilty
of the serial, predatory
sexual abuse of minors"'

543
00:30:13,352 --> 00:30:14,944
He escaped detection
in the past

544
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:19,458
with the complicity
of the Church and he is
believed to be a flight risk.

545
00:30:19,592 --> 00:30:21,617
Then bail is set at $200,000.

546
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,025
Call the next case.

547
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,766
Ms. Cabot?

548
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:31,830
Coming to offer a deal?
Not this time.

549
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:34,168
You want a trial,
you can have one.
My pleasure.

550
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,071
Time to stop Father Michael
from molesting children.

551
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:37,268
Father Michael is innocent.

552
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:40,779
Then why did the Church
settle with his victims
in '96?

553
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:43,315
Why did he seek therapy
to control
his sexual proclivities?

554
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:46,510
There are explanations
for that.
I Iook forward
to hearing them.

555
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:49,612
Then you'd better
prep your witnesses
for an ugly cross

556
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:53,147
because I'm going to make
their Iives very unpleasant,

557
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,659
however young they are.

558
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,195
That should go over
really well with the jury.

559
00:30:57,263 --> 00:30:59,561
Whatever it takes
to clear him.

560
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,567
CABOT: Okay, Darius,
Iet's go through this
one more time.

561
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:09,574
When did you most often have
contact with Father Michael
at the club?

562
00:31:09,642 --> 00:31:12,805
After basketball,
he'd come by the showers.

563
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:15,143
He'd hang around, talk.

564
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:17,242
Did he touch you?

565
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:19,511
He'd put his arm
around my shoulder,

566
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:22,148
pat me on the back.

567
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,385
Did he ever do
anything else?

568
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,025
At his place.

569
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,833
It's okay, baby.
You just tell her.

570
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:42,133
He'd ask me to watch videos
with him.
What kind of videos?

571
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,902
Sports, movies,

572
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:48,637
then other stuff.

573
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,308
Porn.

574
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,413
Then what would he do?

575
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:00,091
He'd sit

576
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:03,627
real close.

577
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:08,160
He'd tell me it was okay
to feel what I was feeling.

578
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:11,759
That it was normal.

579
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:13,460
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

580
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:15,362
AIex.

581
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,313
What are you doing here?
Trying to save your face,
Counselor.

582
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:29,548
Can I talk to your witness?
So you can intimidate him?
No.

583
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:31,453
Then Iook at this.

584
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:36,622
Recognize anything?

585
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:39,221
But this has no bearing
on what Darius is saying now.

586
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:40,287
Really?

587
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,529
Then Iet me suggest
a Iittle experiment.

588
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:46,833
Ask the witness about
Father Michael's television.

589
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,174
CABOT: Did you watch
these videos
on Father Michael's TV?

590
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,167
Yeah.

591
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,041
Was there anything funny
about them?

592
00:32:56,316 --> 00:32:58,045
What does she mean?

593
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:02,919
When you watched the videos,
did you notice anything
unusual about them?

594
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,458
You're asking a child
to judge pornography?

595
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,221
Was it Iike watching
normal TV, Darius?

596
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,124
Yeah.

597
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,094
Was it in color?

598
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:17,964
What else is there?

599
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:21,300
BIack and white.

600
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,102
Father Michael
is a few decades
behind the times.

601
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,238
What is this?

602
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:31,512
Darius was abused
at his school,
nowhere near Father Michael.

603
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:34,554
And you settled
with the Church for $50,000.

604
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:37,454
Father Michael molested him.
No, he didn't.

605
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:39,357
You recycled those accusations

606
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:42,554
when you and your son
were questioned
by the detectives.

607
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,990
And you think your priest
isn't guilty, too?

608
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,124
Darius will never forget
what was done to him.

609
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:51,033
No money will make up
for that.

610
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:55,040
And you would make him
re-Iive his trauma
to get every penny you can.

611
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,800
(DOOR CLOSING)

612
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:02,644
The details of Darius' abuse
were true.
He was alone with a priest,

613
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:05,583
and he watched porn videos,
and he was molested.

614
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:09,748
Mom sued, a priest
was defrocked, the diocese
settled. Mom wants more.

615
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:12,223
If someone abused my son,
I'd do more than sue them.

616
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:14,317
I doubt
you'd make false accusations.

617
00:34:14,394 --> 00:34:17,522
So where does that
Ieave us now?
Father Michael's
going to walk.

618
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,657
Bobby Douglas
is all we've got.
Not anymore.

619
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,404
(JAIL DOOR BUZZING)

620
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,672
Bobby Douglas was placed
in a cell with a Iifer.

621
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:11,944
His name is Dale Farrelly.

622
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:15,215
Bobby kept trying to tell Dale
how much Jesus Ioved him,

623
00:35:15,288 --> 00:35:19,088
till Dale stopped him
by stabbing him 57 times
with a homemade shiv.

624
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,596
This is the interesting part
though, Father. Bobby had
no defensive wounds on him.

625
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,392
He had no cuts on his arms
and his hands.

626
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:29,026
He never even tried
to put up his arms
to protect himself.

627
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:31,730
That boy'd given up.
Now maybe you think
he deserved it

628
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:33,796
because he killed that kid
and he burned your church.

629
00:35:33,874 --> 00:35:36,707
No. No. Bobby was a victim.
Yeah. Whose victim?

630
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:41,811
Come on, Father,
you and me, no badge...
What do you want me
to tell you?

631
00:35:41,882 --> 00:35:44,874
...no collar. Come on.
Bobby's dead!
You're free as a bird.

632
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:48,887
Be a man, confess to me!
AII right! AII right!
It was me. I abused him.

633
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:51,719
How?
I took him to my room,

634
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:54,819
gave him some beer
and made him have sex with me.

635
00:35:54,895 --> 00:35:56,556
What about the videos?
Yes.

636
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,724
We watched videos
to get us in the mood.

637
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:02,257
Where?

638
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:06,533
I told you, in my room.
When did you go to the Lair?

639
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:11,671
Tell me what you told
the boys,

640
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:14,179
how they'd go in Iike Iambs,
come out Iike Iions.

641
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,480
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

642
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:26,189
Somebody must do penance
for Bobby.
Oh, yeah.
But it ain't you, is it?

643
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:30,052
And those therapy sessions,
is that all fiction, too?

644
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,722
That was real.
You give me the names

645
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,925
of the boys you abused.
There are no names.

646
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,130
I've controlled my desires.
I have kept every one
of my vows,

647
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:41,800
poverty, chastity, obedience.
Well, then why'd Bobby
accuse you?

648
00:36:43,677 --> 00:36:47,374
Because he came to me
for help,
and I didn't protect him.

649
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:52,209
Why'd you Ieave school?
Shame.
For what I failed to do.

650
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:56,153
Failed to protect him
against another priest, yeah?
Right?

651
00:36:56,223 --> 00:36:58,248
Yes.
I want a name.

652
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:02,283
I can't. He confessed.

653
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,697
You priests,
you got it all figured out,
don't you?

654
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,928
You confess to each other.

655
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:11,971
You forgive each other,
and you go right on sinning.

656
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:13,835
I'm sorry.
Go to hell.

657
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:22,581
He's covering
for another priest, just Iike
he covered for Bobby Douglas.

658
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,615
No court is going to force him
to break the seal
of confession.

659
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:28,085
Then we Iook
at the '96 case again.

660
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:30,145
This priest must have been
at Saint Tom's

661
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:32,248
when Bobby and the other boys
were abused.

662
00:37:32,325 --> 00:37:35,089
Check the staff roster.
Check if any other payments
were made.

663
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:38,961
I want you to subpoena
any records and bank accounts
that we have to.

664
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:42,399
Easy to say,
but on what grounds?
BENSON: What about RICO?

665
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,802
D.A"s tried it in CIeveland,
in Texas, even in Jersey.

666
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:47,305
And two out of three failed.

667
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:50,434
Well, I'II take those odds,
AIex. What else do we have?

668
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,175
JUDGE LINDEN:
Racketeering, Ms. Cabot?

669
00:37:56,249 --> 00:37:59,776
New Jersey already
dismissed a RICO case
against the Church.

670
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:03,380
But the violations
have continued, and innocent
people are still being harmed.

671
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:05,617
Mr. O'Halloran?
The Church has been
more than willing

672
00:38:05,692 --> 00:38:09,560
to turn over documents
for cases of abuse by priests
without the necessity

673
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:12,097
of a subpoena.
When it suits them.

674
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,157
Only yesterday, Mr. O'Halloran
showed me a secret settlement

675
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:17,863
the Diocese made
with the family
of a 14-year-old boy.

676
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:19,370
Now how many more
of these are there?

677
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:22,772
We'II turn over files relating
to all allegations of abuse,

678
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,835
but the request for the
Diocese's discretionary
accounts overreaches.

679
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,403
We have some rights
to privacy.

680
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:31,211
The accounts will show
how the Church has
consistently made payouts

681
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:34,685
to individuals to buy
their silence and evade
criminal investigation.

682
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:37,780
That is a definition
of a corrupt organization
under RICO.

683
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,725
I'm inclined to agree.
You have your subpoena,
Ms. Cabot.

684
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:44,490
The Diocese will surrender
all reports of abuse,

685
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:48,967
all records of priest
transfers, and will give
the New York District Attorney

686
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,163
access to the Diocese's
discretionary accounts.

687
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,570
AII right. We got payments
to the Ramsay family,

688
00:38:54,642 --> 00:38:56,872
to the Campions,
to the Zuniga family.

689
00:38:56,944 --> 00:39:00,812
Checks drawn in October '96,
$150,000 each.

690
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:04,612
What about Bobby Douglas?
We've got Mary Douglas,
$100,000.

691
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,211
Bobby even Iost out
in the abuse stakes.
Who signed the checks?

692
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:10,018
Looks Iike Randall.

693
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,891
John Randall,
Bishop before Mallinson.

694
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:17,424
The cover-up went straight
to the top.
And stayed there.

695
00:39:17,498 --> 00:39:20,729
Every quarter Mary Douglas
gets $10,000 from the Diocese.

696
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:24,464
Each check is signed
by Bishop Mallinson
right up until Iast month.

697
00:39:24,538 --> 00:39:27,166
Why would Mallinson
continue making the payments?

698
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:31,735
Maybe because he started them.
Staff roster
for Saint Thomas', 1996.

699
00:39:31,946 --> 00:39:35,211
Guess who was
a visiting Latin teacher
three times a week?

700
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:38,342
Father Mallinson.
And Bobby was his star pupil.

701
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:43,522
STABLER: I know
who you're protecting.

702
00:39:48,295 --> 00:39:50,593
I need to know
what he told you.

703
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:53,322
I can't.

704
00:39:59,707 --> 00:40:02,073
Why'd you
become a priest, Father?

705
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:07,211
To serve God and his Church.

706
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:11,479
That includes those boys
that were abused.

707
00:40:13,387 --> 00:40:15,116
How are you serving them?

708
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:20,925
To the best of my ability
without breaking
the Sacraments.

709
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:23,086
By protecting the sinner.

710
00:40:23,364 --> 00:40:26,959
By protecting a priest
who confessed that,

711
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:29,229
"I am abusing a child"'

712
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:33,873
He promised me
that he would get treatment.

713
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:38,674
Then he came back to you
and confessed the same sin
all over again, didn't he?

714
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:43,678
And you absolved him again.

715
00:40:46,086 --> 00:40:48,884
What, because you are bound
by your Sacrament?

716
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:50,116
Yes.

717
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:55,425
Silence is a sin, Father.
I cannot break the seal.

718
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:58,795
Not to defend my name,
not to save my own Iife,

719
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:02,859
not to save
someone else's Iife. I have
to protect the penitent.

720
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:07,937
But what
of the faithful, Father?

721
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:10,770
Who protects us?

722
00:41:26,727 --> 00:41:28,490
What about my vows?

723
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,893
What about the children?

724
00:41:42,776 --> 00:41:43,902
STABLER: Your Grace.

725
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:48,415
Detective Stabler. Michael.
How can I help you?

726
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,815
I need to ask you
about statements you made
to Father Michael

727
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,857
in July and September of 1996.

728
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,490
What statements?

729
00:42:01,362 --> 00:42:05,799
Relating to sexual acts that
you forced on various boys
at Saint Thomas's school.

730
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:08,926
No.

731
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,669
See, what's shared
in the confession between
a priest and a penitent

732
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,607
is sacred and confidential.

733
00:42:20,848 --> 00:42:23,544
Michael, do you know
what you've done?

734
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:31,884
You'II be expelled
from the priesthood and you'II
be cast out of the Church,

735
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:34,623
barred from the Sacraments.

736
00:42:35,396 --> 00:42:37,523
You're risking your soul.

737
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,164
I... I believe I'm saving it.

738
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:52,468
How could you do this?

739
00:42:59,987 --> 00:43:01,887
I couldn't help myself.
