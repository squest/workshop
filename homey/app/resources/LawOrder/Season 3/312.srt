00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:00,264
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:03,965
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,098
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:08,337
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:11,778
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,816
These are their stories,

7
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:16,241
(PANTING)

8
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:20,215
Hurry, Mama!
Hurry.

9
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,951
Mijo, run.
Tell them. Go!

10
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:31,365
Whoa! What's the rush?

11
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:33,163
My brother.
He's been shot.

12
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:34,225
Where is he?

13
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:35,668
They're coming.

14
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:36,864
Give him to me.
No, he's my baby.

15
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,270
I'II take him inside.

16
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,775
I got a gunshot wound here!
Hurry!

17
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:44,980
Prep trauma one.
Page surgery
and tell OR to stand by.

18
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:47,209
Doctor,
please save my baby.
Save him.

19
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:49,751
There's no exit wound.
Let's go. Forget trauma.

20
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:52,310
Oh, my God,
don't Iet him die.
Save him.

21
00:00:52,388 --> 00:00:53,912
He's in good hands.
PIease!

22
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,048
Let's take
a Iook at you.

23
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:56,148
Mommy. Mommy.

24
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:59,456
Officer Jones is gonna
take you for a snack
while I help your mom.

25
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:03,488
No. No. No!
I'm staying with her.

26
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,700
Post two, notify NYPD
for a GSW victim.

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,102
No, no.
No police, please.

28
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:12,573
Ma'am,
your son has
been shot.

29
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:14,735
We have to
call the police.

30
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:16,779
Now,
what is your name?

31
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:19,037
Lupe Rodriguez.

32
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,573
And your son who's wounded?

33
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,742
Jorge.

34
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:25,214
PIease,
go and check on him.
PIease.

35
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:26,312
Mommy.

36
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:29,324
He's gonna be okay.
Baby, he's gonna be okay.

37
00:01:31,794 --> 00:01:33,455
GUARD:
The kid's Iucky.

38
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:35,328
Still critical,
but the docs say

39
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:36,990
he should make it
through surgery.

40
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,124
Where's the mother?

41
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:41,728
In the waiting room
with her older son.
Real shaken up.

42
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:47,798
Where is she?

43
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:49,037
She's gone.

44
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:39,391
She had the kid
in her arms.

45
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:40,554
Came from
over there.

46
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,723
I carried him in,
bleeding all over the place.

47
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:44,766
Did you search
the building?
Yes.

48
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:48,270
Didn't even wait to see
if her son was dead or alive.

49
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:49,835
You're from
Special Victims?

50
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,567
Yeah, we handle
the child abandonment cases.

51
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:53,506
Now, Jorge,
how's he doing?

52
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,134
Just out of surgery.

53
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:56,473
And the mother
was acting strange?

54
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:59,447
She freaked
when she heard me
call the cops.

55
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:02,744
Jorge was shot once
in the Iower abdomen.

56
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:04,217
Any idea
how old he is?

57
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:06,084
Five, maybe six.

58
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,486
What are his chances?

59
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:11,220
We got the slug.
Didn't hit any major
arteries or organs.

60
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,023
He'II recover
from this,

61
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:14,892
but he's got
bigger problems.

62
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,829
Bigger problems
than getting shot?

63
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:19,697
Chest film showed
multiple healed
rib fractures,

64
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,930
so I ordered
a skeletal survey.

65
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,165
Found even more
healed fractures.

66
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,404
His Ieft ulna, humerus,
one on each side of his face.

67
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,972
STABLER: Doctor said the kid
had the crap kicked
out of him for years.

68
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,879
And nobody in that ER
recognized him?

69
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,008
Or the name.

70
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,847
No Jorge Rodriguez
or anyone

71
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,784
matching those injuries
having been treated there.

72
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:41,584
Mother gave
a phony home address
and social security number.

73
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:43,921
I mean, Lupe's probably
not even her real name.

74
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:46,621
So they're new in the area,
or the mother hit
a different hospital

75
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,254
every time
the boy was injured.

76
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:50,196
Makes it harder
to pick up on the abuse.

77
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:51,665
Could be she's protecting
a boyfriend

78
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,634
who thought the kid
was an inconvenience.

79
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:56,365
How about the victim
or his brother were
playing with a gun?

80
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,134
STABLER: He was shot
with a 9 mill.

81
00:03:58,207 --> 00:03:59,606
No stippling
or powder burns.

82
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:01,438
Bullet was still
inside of him.

83
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,068
He had to be shot from
some kind of distance.

84
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:05,943
Great, so we got false ID
on the victim and the mother,

85
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:08,916
no perp, no weapon.
Do we at Ieast
have a crime scene?

86
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:11,545
Checked communications
and the Iocal precinct.

87
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:14,181
No reports of any shootings
around the time
the boy was brought in.

88
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:17,192
Well, that woman
couldn't have run very far
carrying 50 extra pounds.

89
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,784
Cab or car service
would've dropped them

90
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:20,726
right off at the
emergency room doors.

91
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:23,822
CRAGEN: Fin, John,
check with transit
just in case.

92
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,265
After that, call every ER
in the five boroughs.

93
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,666
See if anyone
remembers a child

94
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:29,762
with our John Doe's
old injuries.

95
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,273
Chances are, this family Iives
somewhere near that hospital,

96
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:35,276
and those kids had to
go to school somewhere.

97
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:41,909
STABLER:
Do you recognize this child?

98
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:47,554
It's Miguel Ramos,
one of our first graders.
What happened to him?

99
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:48,988
BENSON: He was shot.

100
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,526
Oh, good Lord.
How is he?

101
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:54,791
Critical, but the doctors
expect him to recover.

102
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:57,332
That must be why
Luis is absent today.

103
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,628
Luis is Miguel's brother?

104
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,760
Yeah.
One of our fifth graders.

105
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:03,304
Both good students. Quiet,
never cause any trouble.

106
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:04,396
We're Iooking
for their mother,

107
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:07,067
but she gave a phony name
and address at the hospital.

108
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:08,804
That must be a habit of hers.

109
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:11,779
The Ietter I sent
to their home Iast week
came back today.

110
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:15,146
No such address.
Phone number's
out of service, too.

111
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,651
That's why I was
Iooking for Luis
this morning.

112
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,916
Her name is Maria.
Maria Ramos.

113
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:25,254
522 Cherry Street.

114
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:27,558
That's in the middle
of the East River Park.

115
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:30,527
Now, she would have
had to show proof
of her current address

116
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:31,725
to register the boys, right?

117
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,530
Yeah. I have a copy
of her Iease.

118
00:05:33,602 --> 00:05:35,661
I mean,
she enrolled the boys
Iast month.

119
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:37,296
Everything seemed
in order.

120
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:38,397
It's a standard form.

121
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:40,806
She could have bought it
at any stationery store
and forged it.

122
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:42,207
Okay.
Is there a father?

123
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,041
No. Not in any
of the paperwork.

124
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:45,341
Must be out of the picture.

125
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:48,212
What about an emergency
contact number
or a place where she works?

126
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:52,015
No. Just a home number
but I know she has a job.

127
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:54,056
Luis takes Miguel
to a youth center

128
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:56,751
on Essex Street
every day after school.

129
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,556
Thank you.

130
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,627
PENZA: Miguel and Luis
are regulars.

131
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:03,926
We try to keep
these Iatchkey kids

132
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,694
off the street
and out of trouble.

133
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:06,928
How did it happen?

134
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:08,299
That's what
we're trying to find out.

135
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:09,929
Are there any friends
that we can talk to?

136
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:10,994
Yeah.

137
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:12,700
Hey, Kevin?

138
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,640
Take over for a minute.

139
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:17,240
McDONALD: What's up,
Mr. Penza?

140
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:19,247
These detectives need
some information.

141
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:21,112
This is Kevin McDonald,
he's one of our counselors.

142
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,172
McDONALD:
How can I help you?

143
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,718
Tell us about
the Ramos brothers.

144
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:24,946
Two great kids.

145
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,920
Luis is one step away
from his red belt.

146
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,184
He's got a mean
flying side kick.

147
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,158
You ever see
their mother
pick them up from school?

148
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:34,196
Yeah. She was here yesterday.
Comes by once a week.

149
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,595
The rest of the time, Luis
is more Iike Miguel's father.

150
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:38,496
Makes sure nobody
messes with him.

151
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,535
Anybody know
where they Iive?

152
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:44,039
I walked Miguel home one night
when Luis was out sick.

153
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:48,906
BENSON:
Nobody named Ramos on here,

154
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:50,741
STABLER:
I Iived in a building
for four years,

155
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,440
never put my name
on the buzzer.

156
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,539
I'II ring the super.

157
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:57,052
Liv,
what's that Iook Iike?

158
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,108
Ricochet mark.

159
00:06:58,187 --> 00:07:00,655
Goes all the way
down the building.

160
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:02,850
Shooter either got him
going into the building...

161
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:05,359
Or coming out.

162
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:09,230
There's no blood
on the stoop
or the sidewalk

163
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,632
STABLER: I don't see
any blood on the walls.

164
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,328
Doesn't Iook Iike
there's any
in the street, either.

165
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,496
But there's some
over here.

166
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:23,538
Trajectory of the slugs
show the weapon
was fired at a Iow angle.

167
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,102
Someone crouching down
across the street?

168
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:26,944
Yeah.
More Iikely a drive-by.

169
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,745
We found more slugs
than shells.

170
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:30,911
So some of the shells
might've ejected
into this car.

171
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:32,283
Or rolled into the sewer.

172
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:33,651
That's not all.

173
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:37,317
Angles of the slug marks
on the building
get more and more blunt

174
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:40,794
from the stoop to the alley,
so the car had to stop.

175
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:43,491
BENSON: So the shooter
fired at somebody
coming out of the building,

176
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:44,965
then escaped
into that alley.

177
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:46,968
Might explain these.

178
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:48,660
Skid marks.

179
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:49,761
Yeah,
and they're fresh ones.

180
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,707
Stopped the car, peeled out,
he Ieft that behind.
Sideswiped him.

181
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,978
Silver car, black paint.

182
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:58,677
AIso fresh.

183
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:00,604
Peter,
get a shot of this.

184
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:01,672
PETER: Got it.

185
00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:02,944
We'II get
the chemistry set out,

186
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,111
match the paint
to the manufacturer.

187
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,655
How Iong before you get us
a make and model on that car?

188
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:10,214
For you two,
give me a day.

189
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,321
BENSON:
Any Iuck on the canvass?

190
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,624
Hear no evil, see no evil.
Zero witnesses.

191
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:16,528
We found
the kids' apartment.

192
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,499
They Iive
with Grandma.

193
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:21,468
Last night when I came home,
the boys weren't here,

194
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:25,564
so I thought maybe Maria took
Luis and Miguel for the night.

195
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:28,735
Well, they Iive here,
but Maria doesn't?

196
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:31,905
Last month,
she shows up at my door

197
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:34,313
and asks me
to take care of the boys.

198
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,139
(SOBBING)

199
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,548
It was the second time
that I see them in two years.

200
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:44,059
BENSON:
Where is Maria staying?

201
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,855
I don't know where.

202
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:48,089
With some friends.

203
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:50,529
But she said that
it was temporary

204
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,931
until she find a place
of her own.

205
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:55,596
Why would anyone
want to harm them?

206
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,336
Last year, Maria called me.

207
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:03,537
She was arrested...
with drugs

208
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:06,338
I gave her the bail money,

209
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:10,442
because she told me
that her boyfriend
could never find out.

210
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,544
When she came here
with my grandsons,

211
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,987
I asked her if she was
back with the drugs

212
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:18,117
and she swore to me
that it was all behind her.

213
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:21,657
But I knew
she was in trouble.

214
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,891
Maria's boyfriend,
do you know where he Iives?

215
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:26,366
In the Bronx.
They Iive together.

216
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,602
We'II need that address.

217
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:32,232
You said that you tried
to reach Maria,
but you couldn't.

218
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:36,105
This is her telephone number
where she works,

219
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,038
some restaurant,

220
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,941
in case the boys got sick.

221
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:48,218
Two other detectives
were here yesterday
asking about Maria.

222
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,019
Don't you people communicate
with each other?

223
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,253
That would be
much too efficient
for a bureaucracy Iike ours.

224
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:53,886
The detectives say
where they were from?

225
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:55,328
No, but they were
undercover.

226
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:57,194
Looked more Iike
drug dealers than cops.

227
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,290
FIN: What did you tell them?

228
00:09:58,367 --> 00:09:59,527
MANAGER:
Maria had a day off.

229
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:00,591
I didn't know
where she was.

230
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,068
She scheduled
to work here today?

231
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:04,332
She didn't show up.
Not Iike her at all.

232
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:07,000
Hard worker, good attitude,
until today.

233
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:08,941
But if she don't call me,
I got to Iet her go.

234
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:10,808
MUNCH: She seem uneasy
about anything Iately?

235
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,643
Yeah, two days ago,
she was working the grill.

236
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,775
Some customer comes in
and calls her by name.

237
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:17,512
She makes Iike
she doesn't even
know the guy,

238
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:18,610
and then she said
she was sick,

239
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:19,881
(PHONE RINGING)
and she had to go home.

240
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:21,354
Okay, if you see her...

241
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:24,591
Yeah, don't worry,
I have her paycheck.
She'II call me.

242
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,649
Hello?

243
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:29,129
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

244
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,089
Yes?

245
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,691
Police.
I'm Detective Stabler.

246
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:36,101
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.
You are?

247
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,468
Fredo Garcia.
How can I help you?

248
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,064
We're here
about your family.

249
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:42,337
Did something
happen to them?

250
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:45,775
BENSON:
When were they Iast here?

251
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:47,247
About a month ago.

252
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:50,513
I was away on business.
Came back, they were gone.

253
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,614
Can you tell me
what this is about?

254
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:54,849
Miguel was hurt.

255
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:56,982
Did she do it?

256
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,526
Why would you say that?

257
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:00,960
Maria has a crazy temper.

258
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,696
I came home one night,
she was hitting Miguel.

259
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,599
I warned her
if she did it again,
I'd call the cops.

260
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,796
I guess
that's why she Ieft.

261
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:10,466
But you didn't
report them missing?

262
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,667
I Iooked for them myself.
Didn't have any Iuck.

263
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:17,576
She wanted to Ieave me.
I figured, what am I
gonna do to stop her?

264
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:18,874
BENSON: How Iong
were you two together?

265
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:19,971
Two years.

266
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,779
And she gave you
no indication where
she might've gone?

267
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:24,978
Didn't even Ieave a note.

268
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:28,112
If you find them,
would you tell them

269
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,249
I'd Iike her and the boys
to come back?

270
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:33,859
Sure will.

271
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,958
He's so concerned
that Maria beat Miguel

272
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,629
but doesn't ask
what happened to him.

273
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:45,139
Wonder what Fredo
does for a Iiving.

274
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,368
Somebody's dealing
out of here.

275
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,877
Could explain
Maria's drug problem.

276
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:53,244
Last year Maria was
busted with a dozen
dime bags of heroin

277
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:54,612
and $1,000 cash.

278
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:56,378
Possession
with intent to sell.

279
00:11:56,452 --> 00:11:57,942
First offense,
D.A. knocked it down.

280
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,817
She did a year
on probation.

281
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:01,651
None of this jibes
with a woman

282
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:04,192
slinging burgers
to support her kids.

283
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:06,989
We figure out their movements
the day of the shooting?

284
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:10,623
The kids went to school
and the youth center as usual.

285
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:13,862
Maria picked them up.
We don't know where
she was before that.

286
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,166
Yeah, we're thinking
they all went
to Maria's mother's place,

287
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:17,933
even though
it was just Miguel
who got shot.

288
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:20,668
From there,
they ran the three blocks
to the hospital.

289
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,967
CRAGEN: Well, what about
the ex-boyfriend?

290
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:24,376
Munch is running
a rap sheet on him now.

291
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:26,209
Now Fredo's story is,

292
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:29,011
Maria Ieft because
he threatened
to call the cops on her

293
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:30,073
for beating up
her boys.

294
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:31,813
Maybe Miguel can tell us
what happened.

295
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,287
He's asking
for his mother.

296
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:36,949
BENSON: What's going on?

297
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:39,016
Doctor told me
not to say anything.

298
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,493
What happened?

299
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,120
Miguel is dead.

300
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:44,093
They just told us
that he was awake.

301
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,657
Complications from surgery?

302
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:49,431
Pillow over his face.
He was smothered.

303
00:12:55,511 --> 00:13:00,278
I was checking his vitals.
He was stable, awake, alert.

304
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:03,113
I walked out
to get a peds
blood pressure cuff.

305
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:05,244
I was only gone five minutes.
AII right.

306
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,344
Now, when you were
in there

307
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,719
did Miguel say anything
about the shooting?

308
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:11,454
He asked for his mother
and his brother, that's all.

309
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:12,789
Okay,
think really hard.

310
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:15,853
You remember seeing
any strangers on the floor?

311
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:19,924
Just some visitors
and a maintenance man.

312
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,260
Oh, my God.

313
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,326
What?

314
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:25,430
The maintenance guy.

315
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:29,170
He passed the Nurses' Station
as I was going back to Miguel.

316
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:32,839
I said, "Hi"
and he just kept walking.

317
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,246
Someone I haven't seen before.

318
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:37,251
Can you describe to us
what he Iooks Iike?

319
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:41,949
Hispanic, average height,
dark hair.

320
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:45,289
Okay. We'II need you
to describe him
to a sketch artist.

321
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,349
I'II tell my boss.

322
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,588
Good.

323
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,727
Let's go.

324
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:53,959
Pair of patrols found
a maintenance worker's uniform

325
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,526
in the men's room
on the first floor.

326
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:57,868
Nurse saw him
just before
she found Miguel.

327
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,737
Does the mother's
ex-boyfriend
Iook good for this?

328
00:13:59,808 --> 00:13:58,742
We'II have the nurse
work with the sketch artist.

329
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,370
AII right, Iook,
I want everybody
who works in this hospital

330
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:02,470
interviewed quick.

331
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:05,414
Miguel's mother and brother
could be next.

332
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:12,053
Look Iike you could
use some caffeine.

333
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:14,114
Twelve-hour sack time
would be a Iot better.

334
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,921
Sketch of your guy.

335
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:18,491
Anything back
from the Iab, yet?

336
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:20,326
Dozens of prints taken
from the hospital room.

337
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,491
No word yet
if it matches anyone
in our system.

338
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,091
Results are in
of the sideswiped car

339
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,466
from the scene
of the drive-by.

340
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:28,062
Your shooter drove
a black '98 Lexus.

341
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,506
Must be a couple
of thousand of those
in the Tri-State Area.

342
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,601
Why don't you guys
catch an hour or two
up in the crib?

343
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:34,667
We'II cover for you.

344
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:35,940
Thanks.

345
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:37,038
It's gonna have to wait.

346
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:38,139
What's the problem?

347
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:41,845
That was Maria Ramos' boss.
She's going to
pick up her check.

348
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:51,161
Manager just gave me
the heads up.

349
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:56,265
Wake up call,
she's at the counter.
Neither did we.

350
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,323
What?

351
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:59,893
OIivia said
she didn't see her coming in.

352
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:01,336
Who's that?

353
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,540
MUNCH: Not Maria.

354
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:11,409
On the way out.
Leather jacket.
Orange pants.

355
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,245
We got her.

356
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:24,227
You want us
to take her?

357
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:26,491
No, not yet. Let's see
where she Ieads us.

358
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:32,065
Looks Iike she's heading
for the bus stop.

359
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:15,242
You think she's just
bringing that check to Maria?

360
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:17,508
Think that'd be too easy.

361
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:26,387
Hey, Luis.

362
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,452
Luis. Let's go.

363
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,186
COLON: Leave him alone!
Let go of me.

364
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:33,855
I didn't do anything.
BENSON:
Luis, you're not in trouble.

365
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,422
Listen to me, we're cops.
We're here to help you.

366
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,694
What's going on here?

367
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:37,792
Let's start
with your real name.

368
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:38,858
Annie Colon.

369
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:43,465
Annie Colon,
why are you picking up
Maria Ramos' paycheck?

370
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,202
She asked me to.
Where is she?

371
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:48,370
I don't know.
She slept on my couch
for the Iast week.

372
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:50,437
Then Iast night
she said she had to Ieave,

373
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,073
told me to
give her check to Luis.

374
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,310
You Iying to us?

375
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:55,012
I'm telling the truth,
I swear.

376
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:57,020
Luis,
where's your mother?

377
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,923
That's a tough guy,
he doesn't wanna work with us.

378
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,618
I'II tell you what,
you want to play it that way?

379
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:02,751
Let go of me.

380
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:04,317
What are you doing?
BENSON: We're taking him in.

381
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:06,159
No!
For what?
He's 10 years old!

382
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,289
He's truant.

383
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:08,798
LUIS: Stop. Let go.

384
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:19,934
Luis, we wanna help you.

385
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:21,706
But you have
to help us, too.

386
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,546
Why was your mom scared
to pick up her own paycheck?

387
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:31,121
STABLER:
You Ieft your Iittle brother
in the hospital, why?

388
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,020
Did you see Miguel?

389
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:34,524
Yeah, we saw him.

390
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:38,462
Now, Iook, we know
you and your mom
are in trouble,

391
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,364
and we wanna protect you,
but we've got
to talk to her first.

392
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:57,138
Luis, tell us where
you and your mom are staying.

393
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:02,383
No. I'm not telling you.

394
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,081
That kid's hanging tough.

395
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:07,181
Can we hold him?

396
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,282
For cutting class?

397
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,657
As a material witness.
We know he saw something.

398
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:12,821
We put him in the system,
they put him
in juvenile detention,

399
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,524
which just
terrifies him further.

400
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,999
He didn't do anything.
Let's try harder.

401
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:20,295
Poor kid doesn't even know
about his brother.

402
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,963
Luis have anything on him?

403
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,268
A few bucks,
slip of paper

404
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:24,501
with the word "Liberty"
written on it,

405
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:25,634
a school subway pass,

406
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,938
and transit says
most trips

407
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:28,740
originate from
the Lawrence Street Station.

408
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:31,281
N and R trains in Brooklyn,
near the Fulton Mall.

409
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:33,146
They could be
staying near there.

410
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:34,708
CRAGEN: Then that's where
we Iook for Maria.

411
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:38,085
Start with every place
that has Liberty
in the name.

412
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:43,456
Haven't seen anyone
Iike that around here.

413
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:46,489
Anyone move into the building
in the Iast few days?

414
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:49,124
No. No new tenants
in six months.

415
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,667
Okay. Thanks.

416
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:54,633
We've been to
Liberty Apartments,
Liberty Hotel.

417
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,675
There's a Liberty Avenue exit
off the Van Wyck in Queens.

418
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,471
You know,
this is gonna take us
at Ieast a month.

419
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,102
Maria must be going
out of her mind

420
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,443
wondering why Luis
hasn't come home.

421
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:04,539
What's next on the Iist?

422
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:05,640
Liberty Knick Knacks.

423
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,708
If Liberty's not
the name of the place
where she's staying,

424
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:10,549
well, maybe it's where
she's got a new job.

425
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,325
I'm not seeing anybody.

426
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:18,862
Right there.

427
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:21,625
BENSON: Maria.

428
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,527
Go down that aisle.

429
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:28,461
Can I help you?

430
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,564
Maria Ramos?

431
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,438
You get away from me.

432
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,942
Calm down, Maria.
We're the police.

433
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:34,137
We need you
to come with us.

434
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:35,474
Why? Why?

435
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:38,146
You Ieft Miguel
in the hospital.

436
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:40,878
Well, I had to.
What's wrong?

437
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,887
My baby,
is he okay?

438
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:45,280
Let's talk privately.

439
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,483
No, no, no, tell me.
What's going on?

440
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,186
Well, tell me,
how is my baby?

441
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,818
Miguel's dead.

442
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:53,728
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

443
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:55,390
He's fine.
He's in a good hospital.

444
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:56,455
We're sorry, Maria.

445
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:59,970
No, no, no! You're wrong.
You're so wrong. He's fine.

446
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,671
The doctor told me
he was gonna be okay.

447
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,798
Why don't we
talk somewhere else?

448
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,900
No. PIease, please.

449
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:07,704
Sorry.

450
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:12,079
No, you're not sorry.
You never help us. Stop it!

451
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:19,284
Does Luis know about Miguel?

452
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:20,415
BENSON:
We haven't said anything yet.

453
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,118
MARIA: Where is he?
I have to tell him.

454
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:23,558
He's here. Safe.

455
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:24,993
Let me see him.

456
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:27,697
Maria, Luis is going
to a shelter

457
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,665
until we can place him
in a foster home.

458
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,793
You can't take him
away from me. He's my son.

459
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,996
BENSON: So was Miguel,
but where were you
when he needed you?

460
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:35,835
I Ioved him.
It's a hell of a way
to show it,

461
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:38,842
Ieaving him
in that hospital
Iike that.

462
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,878
I thought
he would be safe there.

463
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:42,105
From the person
who shot him,

464
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,807
or whoever used him
as a punching bag?

465
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,349
STABLER: Healed fractures
in both arms and ribs.

466
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,543
He had a broken nose.

467
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,883
His jaw was cracked twice.

468
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:50,943
Was it you?

469
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:53,217
I never Iaid a hand
on my kids.

470
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,593
Her word against his.

471
00:20:56,661 --> 00:20:58,288
Whose word?
STABLER: Fredo.

472
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:02,595
You talked to Fredo?
He knows I'm here?
He knows Luis is here?

473
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,997
How did Fredo
treat your kids?

474
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:07,627
He Ioved them.

475
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:10,836
BENSON: So why don't
you want us to talk to him?

476
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:15,810
Maria,
someone beat up your boy.

477
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,713
Now if it's not you,
then it must be Fredo.

478
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,611
You've got to stop
covering for him.

479
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:27,183
We can protect you and Luis.

480
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:30,724
You just don't get it.
I can't.

481
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:38,228
CABOT: Fredo has her spooked.

482
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:40,464
How many times
have we seen this,
Counselor?

483
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:42,597
Woman trapped
in a violent relationship

484
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:44,232
and doesn't want
to press charges.

485
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,573
Yeah, but she Ieft him.
That takes courage.

486
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:49,135
And no doubt
pissed off the bastard.

487
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:52,114
CRAGEN:
Now he wants revenge,
so he shoots her kid.

488
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:53,980
But he doesn't count
on Miguel surviving,

489
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:56,418
so he sends somebody
to the hospital
to shut him up.

490
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,546
That seems pretty extreme
for a family squabble.

491
00:21:58,623 --> 00:22:00,818
Unless that's not
all this is.

492
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:02,086
John, any Iuck?

493
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,025
No rap sheet
under the name
Fredo Garcia.

494
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:05,722
Check with Narcotics
Task Force.

495
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:07,594
If this guy's a player,
they got to know about him.

496
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:08,791
I just got off the phone
with them.

497
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:11,334
I asked about Fredo,
guy says they never
even heard of him.

498
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:12,494
Then he starts
questioning me

499
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,901
Iike he doesn't think
I'm a cop.

500
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:14,960
The only thing
he didn't ask me

501
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,506
was whether I wear
boxers or briefs.

502
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:18,371
Sounds Iike
they know something
they don't wanna share.

503
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:20,468
I'II call my office
and see if anybody
knows anything.

504
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:21,534
Thanks.

505
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:23,676
Any other back doors
we can open?

506
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:25,773
Fin bolted
a couple of minutes ago,
didn't say where.

507
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,215
That usually means
a covert meeting

508
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:29,947
with one of his operatives
in the drug netherworld.

509
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:31,784
What did Maria say?
Nothing.

510
00:22:31,856 --> 00:22:34,086
We're gonna have
to talk to Luis.

511
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:37,059
Let me take a run at him.
I speak 10-year-old.

512
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:38,459
AII right.

513
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:47,065
You didn't finish.
Was the burger okay?

514
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:48,630
Full.

515
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,999
Sorry. I didn't mean
to treat you Iike a baby.

516
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,566
Just the way
I was brought up.

517
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:56,814
My mom, you know,
she'd kind of
hover over me.

518
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:58,748
Just the opposite of you
and your mother.

519
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,042
What do you mean?

520
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:03,588
When I was your age,
I wasn't allowed

521
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:05,282
to ride my bike
around the corner.

522
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:08,019
You, you pick up
your Iittle brother
at school every day,

523
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:09,219
ride the subway alone.

524
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:11,387
You're a pretty
independent guy.

525
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:14,057
Yeah, someone's got to do it.

526
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:18,198
I have a Iot of respect
for you, Luis.
I Iive by myself.

527
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,828
I only have myself
to worry about.

528
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,999
You take care
of your mother,
your brother.

529
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,840
I didn't do that too well.

530
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:29,574
What makes you say that?

531
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:32,208
Miguel got shot.

532
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:33,342
That's not your fault.

533
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:34,545
Yes, it is.

534
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:38,081
My stomach hurts.

535
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:41,592
You don't have
to be scared, Luis.

536
00:23:42,194 --> 00:23:43,525
I don't want
to talk about it.

537
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:46,393
Talking can be good.
Make you feel better.

538
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:48,725
It'II get you into trouble.

539
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:52,030
You don't have to keep
everything to yourself.

540
00:23:52,104 --> 00:23:54,629
He'II hurt my mom
if I say anything.

541
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,133
Luis, Iook at me.

542
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:01,312
Your mom turns to you
for help, doesn't she?

543
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:04,306
We take care of each other.

544
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:07,409
I'm a detective. I want
to take care of you, too.

545
00:24:07,486 --> 00:24:10,114
I can't do that
unless you talk to me.

546
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,283
But I promised her
I wouldn't.

547
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,989
Your mom's confused, Luis.
She needs your help.

548
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,633
You can't protect her
unless you tell me
what Fredo did.

549
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:33,275
I saw one of Fredo's men

550
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:38,041
in the car where
the shots came from.

551
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,586
What do you want
with me anyhow?

552
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:44,417
Fredo Garcia
mean anything to you?

553
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,821
You trying to get me killed?
I'm out of here.

554
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,552
Don't move.

555
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:49,821
If the guy's in the trade,
why don't I know
anything about him?

556
00:24:49,895 --> 00:24:52,455
He's new,
since you stopped
being a narc.

557
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:54,590
Keeps a Iow profile,
my own personal mantra.

558
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,133
Here's my mantra.

559
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:58,465
I scratched your back,
now I got a major itch.

560
00:24:58,537 --> 00:24:59,834
Unless you want
to be keeping a Iow profile

561
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:01,805
in some cell in Rikers.

562
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:02,966
You got to watch my back.

563
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,201
Talk!

564
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:08,602
Two years, Fredo's got
the dope market cornered.

565
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,669
How?

566
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:11,978
By killing off
the Iocal competition.

567
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,984
Joey Stapleton
was the main supplier
in the Bronx

568
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:15,679
till Fredo capped him.

569
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:17,221
How'd he take over
the building?

570
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:19,382
He hears we had this talk,
I'm a dead man.

571
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:23,019
Listen, the evidence
I have on you
is good for two years.

572
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:27,390
He forced out
some of the tenants
and paid off the rest.

573
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:29,093
Moved in with some woman
and her kids.

574
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,032
It's a nice Iittle front
for him.

575
00:25:31,103 --> 00:25:32,695
I wouldn't want
to be that bitch
right now, though.

576
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:33,931
Why not?

577
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:35,871
Word is,
he's got a hit out on her.

578
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,075
For ratting him out
to you cops.

579
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:43,915
Fin's guy says
Fredo charmed his way

580
00:25:43,982 --> 00:25:46,416
into Maria's Iife,
into her apartment.

581
00:25:46,485 --> 00:25:48,680
He used
the whole damn building
for his drug business.

582
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:51,917
BENSON:
While the rest of his rats
crawl around the city.

583
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:53,480
We're ready.

584
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,890
BENSON: Let's do it.

585
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,954
It may be the only way
to nail Fredo.

586
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,190
How's Miguel?

587
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:04,860
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

588
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:08,096
No!

589
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:09,734
MARIA:
It's not your fault, Mijito.

590
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:11,173
No,

591
00:26:11,243 --> 00:26:14,508
It's Fredo's fault,
I told them,

592
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,480
No, no, no!
Tell them you lied,

593
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:19,574
Tell them!
Please, he takes it back,

594
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:24,481
He's a child, You tricked him,
You made him tell you lies,

595
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:25,545
Mom!

596
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:26,852
Luis, please,
listen to me,

597
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:30,827
No, Mommy, tell them,
Tell them it was Fredo,

598
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:32,488
Don't be afraid,

599
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,090
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

600
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:46,672
STABLER: Fredo's not just
some jealous Iover Maria's
trying to escape from.

601
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:49,475
He happens to be
one of the city's
biggest drug Iords.

602
00:26:49,548 --> 00:26:51,675
As Iong as she and Luis
are breathing,
they're in danger.

603
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,377
We can keep them
in protective custody.

604
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:55,215
Safest bet
is to get them
out of town.

605
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:57,619
I need them here
to prep the case,
go before the grand jury.

606
00:26:57,689 --> 00:26:58,678
Now we're talking
about a hotel.

607
00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:00,486
We got no budget
for witness protection.

608
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,959
Any chance the D.A.'s office
can pony up the bucks?

609
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:05,462
You know how it works.
You pay before indictment,
we pay after.

610
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,397
Come on, 1PP's down
our throats on money
ever since the attacks.

611
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:10,401
Help us out here.
I'II see what I can do.

612
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:12,528
In the meantime,
try to find someplace
that isn't The PIaza.

613
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:14,037
What about
Miguel's funeral?

614
00:27:14,106 --> 00:27:15,300
Crime Victims Board
will pay.

615
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:17,069
And we do the arrangements.

616
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:20,043
Find a church as far away
from her neighborhood
as you possibly can.

617
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:23,104
Immediate family
and us only.

618
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:29,952
MARIA:
I was in love with Fredo,

619
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,255
He was wonderful.

620
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:38,090
Until I came home
from work one night.

621
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:41,894
He was at my kitchen table
with his friends,
cutting heroin.

622
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:43,929
Where were the boys?

623
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:45,435
Watching them.

624
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:48,866
I told Fredo to stop,
and he hits me with his gun

625
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,104
and tells me
to never embarrass him
in front of his friends.

626
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:56,545
Later he apologized and said
he wouldn't do it again.

627
00:27:57,282 --> 00:27:59,147
It usually gets worse.

628
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,448
He started to beat
Miguel and Luis, too.

629
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,882
Then he would beg us
to forgive him.

630
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:11,456
Bring us presents

631
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:15,593
and promise
he will never do it again.

632
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:17,861
Until the next time.

633
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:21,372
Maria, did you ever
try to Ieave before now?

634
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:26,907
I had no place to go,
no money.

635
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:28,741
He would only give me
enough to buy food

636
00:28:28,814 --> 00:28:31,544
and spend the rest on himself
and other women.

637
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,710
But, Maria,
you were arrested for drugs.

638
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:36,014
Were you using?

639
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,180
I never used.

640
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:40,017
Never.
Fredo degraded me.

641
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:42,226
He made me carry his drugs
inside of me

642
00:28:42,294 --> 00:28:44,353
so the police
wouldn't find them,

643
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:46,226
forced my boys to run drugs,

644
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:49,597
told me he would kill them
if we didn't do
as we were told.

645
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:51,693
But you stayed.

646
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,362
Something must have
made you realize

647
00:28:53,438 --> 00:28:55,599
that you had
to get away from him.

648
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:58,337
One day,
Fredo took Luis' baseball bat

649
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:01,812
and beat a man unconscious
while Luis and I watched.

650
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,817
I knew we could be next.

651
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:10,587
Your boss at the restaurant
said that somebody
recognized you.

652
00:29:11,524 --> 00:29:13,583
That's how Fredo
found you, isn't it?

653
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,786
It was the man
I delivered the dope to.

654
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:19,087
He runs Fredo's operation
in Brooklyn.

657
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:22,824
Yeah, come in.

Yeah.

We'II start in just a moment.

662

Gracias, Father.

BENSON:
What are they doing here?

664
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,428
Said it couldn't wait.

665
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,524
Detectives Milton...

666
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:56,659
And Tatum, yeah,
from the Bronx.

667
00:29:56,736 --> 00:29:57,725
What's the problem?

668
00:29:57,804 --> 00:29:59,271
She didn't tell you?

669
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:00,498
BENSON: Tell us what?
Oh, my God.

670
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:01,835
She and her son Miguel
witnessed Fredo Garcia

671
00:30:01,908 --> 00:30:03,739
off one of his competitors,

672
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,175
a dealer named
Joey Stapleton.

673
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:08,338
I mean, she came to us,
but disappeared before
we got her statement.

674
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:11,474
Fredo's men follow you,
and that's how he found me.

675
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:14,452
Maria, it's time to start
telling the truth.

676
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:19,255
Yes, we did see it.

677
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:23,623
We saw how Fredo
killed that man,
and I did call the police.

678
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:28,595
But I run when they said
I had to testify in court.

679
00:30:28,668 --> 00:30:30,226
I couldn't face Fredo.

fired at the church
on Broadway and 177.

684
00:30:39,612 --> 00:30:42,410
We got a civilian down.
We need an ambulance now.

for one of these.

691

BENSON: Look at this.

692
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:15,106
It's good enough
to fool the manager
at Maria's restaurant.

693
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:17,149
STABLER:
Where'd you get that?
Shove it.

00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:18,240
I'm sorry?

695
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:19,545
Shove it.

696
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:21,243
You know something?

you're gonna wish
you'd shot me.

699
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:29,184
No answer. Come on.

700
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,457
How bad?
She got it in the arm.

701
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,862
Okay, Iet's get her
out of here.

702

over here, please.

703

You can't help us.

NURSE: Number three.

708
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:56,150
Where do you
recognize him from?

709
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:58,690
He's the one I saw passing
the Nurses' Station

710
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:01,386
wearing the
maintenance man's uniform.

711
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,121
He killed Miguel Ramos.

712
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:04,992
You didn't see him
kill anyone.

713

CABOT: Maria's turn.

716
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:32,588
Number three.
His name is Eddie Fuentes.

717
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,491
FIN: Where do you
recognize him from?

718
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:38,556
He works for Fredo.

719
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:41,691
I saw him driving the car
when Miguel was shot.

720
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:44,133
Driving? He wasn't
one of the shooters?

721
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:46,068
You can't Iead her
Iike that.

722
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:50,871
Okay, Maria,
if Fuentes was driving,
who shot Miguel?

723
00:32:51,877 --> 00:32:54,108
Fredo. From the back seat
of the car.

724
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:01,612
My client wishes to exercise
his right to remain silent.

725
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,249
He'd better say something
if he has any hope
of staying alive.

726
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:06,314
Staying alive?

727
00:33:06,393 --> 00:33:08,293
Miguel was
a murder witness.

728
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:11,354
Killing him in that hospital
means a needle in your arm,
Eddie.

729
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:12,830
You can't prove
I did that.

730
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,925
Moron, we got a witness
places you 10 feet
from Miguel's room

731
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:18,699
just before they found him
with a pillow over his face.

732
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:21,036
Your '98 black Lexus
Ieft skid marks

733
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:22,939
and paint scrapings
at the scene of the crime.

734
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,911
STABLER: And we matched
the slug in Miguel to the one
you put in his mother.

735
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:28,379
That's attempted murder
of another witness
and six cops.

736
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:30,279
And if you think
the jury is going to care

737
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,284
that nobody actually
saw you smother Miguel,

738
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:34,616
I can assure you,
they won't.

739
00:33:35,255 --> 00:33:37,052
I don't talk for nothing.

740
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:38,591
Murder one,
Iife without parole.

741
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:39,682
What kind of deal is that?

742
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,489
CABOT: The kind that
keeps you breathing.

743
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,258
You give us Fredo,
we take the death penalty
off the table.

(WHISPERING)

745
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,439
You gotta protect me.

746
00:33:57,511 --> 00:33:59,706
We'II keep you
out of the general pop.

747
00:34:02,783 --> 00:34:05,650
Fredo...
It was all his idea.

748
00:34:06,353 --> 00:34:07,581
I told him he was crazy,

749
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:10,179
that doing the kid
in the hospital
was too risky.

750
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,986
Why'd he want Miguel dead?

751
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,027
Miguel and Maria.

752
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,824
They saw him
whack Joey Stapleton.

753
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,530
Fredo gave me
60,000 to hit them.

754
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,692
How did you find Maria
and her boys?

755
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,236
First time,
we followed her
to the diner

756
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:25,896
where she met
those two cops.

757
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:30,336
We Iost her when she split,
so we followed the cops.

758
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,434
(CHUCKLES)

759
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:33,843
They Ied us
right to the church.

760
00:34:35,816 --> 00:34:37,807
Followed us?
That's crap.

761
00:34:38,218 --> 00:34:41,187
Fuentes Iies
and the deal's off.
He's Iooking at death row.

762
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,721
Even he's not that stupid.

763
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,915
We need to
interview him.

764
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,357
No, he's our catch.
He already rolled on Fredo
for your case.

765
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:49,327
Now, who told you
that we had Maria?

766
00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:52,593
Narcotics Task Force said
you were asking questions.

767
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:54,861
Someone in your own squad
told us about the funeral.

768
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:57,460
And your going there
almost cost us Maria and Luis.

769
00:34:57,537 --> 00:35:00,870
Not to mention
four of my detectives
and your own sorry asses.

770
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,568
Come on,
Iet us talk to the girl.

771
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,076
You want in,
you follow my orders.

772
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,146
BENSON: Did you go
to Maria's hotel first?

773
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:10,212
Before the church.

774
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:13,912
Which means Fredo could know
we have Maria and Luis there.

775
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:16,317
We gotta move them.

776
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,687
You wanna talk to Maria?

777
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:20,248
We work together
to protect her,

778
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,160
and you two just drew
the graveyard shift.

779
00:35:25,031 --> 00:35:26,225
MARIA: Where's this new hotel?

780
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:27,493
Rockland County.

781
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:28,898
You can't take us there.

782
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,529
I don't drive,
and we'II be trapped
in that hotel,

783
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:33,334
and Luis needs
to be in school.

784
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:35,067
Maria, you're gonna
have to trust us.

785
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:36,734
The only way that
we can keep you safe

786
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,677
from Fredo's people
is to get you
out of this city.

787
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:43,079
You have Eddie Fuentes.
Let Luis and me go.
I'II be back to testify.

788
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,879
That's what you told
the other detectives

789
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:46,851
before you ditched them
and took off.

790
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,888
I did what I had to do
to protect my family.

791
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:52,049
You almost
got yourself killed.
PIease, get in.

792
00:35:57,564 --> 00:36:01,125
I never should have
gone to those cops
or talked to you.

793
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:06,530
We could have disappeared,
and Miguel would
still be alive.

794
00:36:08,942 --> 00:36:12,309
I killed my own son
because I didn't know
what to do.

795
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:15,841
Let us help you.

796
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,884
You can't help me.

797
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:19,646
He could be
one of Fredo's people.

798
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,745
Or him, or them, or anybody.

799
00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:23,948
You can't stop them.

800
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:26,254
If you just work with us,
we can protect you.

801
00:36:26,326 --> 00:36:29,784
That's what
the other cops said
and Iook what happened.

802
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,759
I'm not testifying
against Fredo.

803
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:37,963
Listen to me,
as Iong as you're out there,
you're a threat to Fredo.

804
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:42,332
He can't afford
to Ieave you alive.

805
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,172
He'II never Ieave you alone.

806
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:47,269
Now, you refuse to testify,
we'II subpoena you.

807
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:49,672
If you still refuse
to testify, you go to jail

808
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,115
and you Iose Luis
to a foster home.

809
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:53,447
Then take him!

810
00:36:53,987 --> 00:36:57,218
Put him in someplace
where they can never find him.

811
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,622
We can't Iive
Iike this anymore.

812
00:37:09,502 --> 00:37:10,491
CABOT: She has to testify.

813
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,559
Well, you can't blame her.

814
00:37:11,638 --> 00:37:14,106
Fredo killed Miguel
because Maria talked
to the Bronx detectives.

815
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:16,938
Maria doesn't nail him,
he wins.
You'd cut her Ioose?

816
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,739
I'm just saying that
we're part of her problem.

817
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:20,473
She thinks
that we're punishing her

818
00:37:20,547 --> 00:37:21,844
by making her
a moving target,

819
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:23,007
and she's right.

820
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,675
She's in more danger
having us around.

821
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:27,185
Is there any way to do this
without Maria and Luis?

822
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:30,985
They saw Fredo shoot Miguel.
Maria watched him
murder Joey Stapleton.

823
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:32,490
CRAGEN: We have Eddie Fuentes.

824
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,551
He's a co-conspirator.
Without corroboration,
I can't even indict.

825
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:36,653
You know,
if we were the Feds,

826
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,960
we could give her
a whole new identity,
new Iife.

827
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:41,262
No honor among thieves.
Fuentes squealed Iike a pig.

828
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:44,394
Gave up Fredo's operation
including the Iayout
of Fredo's crib

829
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,234
complete with all
the escape routes.

830
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,501
Maria's not talking
till we get Fredo
out of the picture.

831
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:50,406
FIN: We'd better do it quick.

832
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,241
They go to the
grandmother's house to get
Luis' asthma medicine.

833
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:56,043
Luis fakes sick.
Maria and Luis
go into the bathroom,

834
00:37:56,116 --> 00:37:59,984
close the door behind them,
and Maria bolts out
the fire escape.

835
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,918
Tatum and his partner
Iost her.

836
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,548
Couple of square-badge
security guards
wouldn't have fallen for that.

837
00:38:04,624 --> 00:38:08,185
Yeah, we better pick up Fredo
before he finds out.

838
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:10,286
Decision time,
Counselor.

839
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:18,868
I'II wake up a judge.
The warrant will be
for the drugs only.

840
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:31,844
What you want, man?

841
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,113
Trying to get a taste,
player.

842
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:36,217
4:00 in the morning, man,
we're closed.

843
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:37,620
Open up.

844
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:39,318
Yo, you rob for that?

845
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:42,828
Do you really care?
You gonna turn down
this business?

846
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:47,859
Yo, I've never
seen you before, man.

847
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,801
I ain't never seen
you before, man. Come on.

848
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:54,668
Inside. Follow me.

849
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:02,439
You trying to take me off,
man? You in big trouble.

850
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:06,179
Shut up. Police.
We're all clear.

851
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:15,791
MAN:
Police! Don't move.

852
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:21,557
(GUNSHOT)

853
00:39:21,635 --> 00:39:22,624
(SCREAM)

854
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:24,293
Police.

855
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,199
We've got the building
surrounded.

856
00:39:27,274 --> 00:39:29,708
Open the door slowly
and throw the gun out.

857
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:32,177
WOMAN: Get out!
I'm taking care of this.

858
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,504
Maria.

859
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,311
Maria, it's Detective Stabler.
Are you all right?

860
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:37,646
MARIA: Go away.

861
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:40,446
Do it.

862
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:42,811
(MAN YELLING)

863
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:45,452
STABLER:
Maria, put down the gun.

864
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:47,050
The bitch shot me!

865
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:48,618
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

866
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:51,221
Maria, Maria,
he's never gonna
hurt you again.

867
00:39:51,298 --> 00:39:52,663
Now give us the gun.

868
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,564
Shoot her!
I didn't do anything!

869
00:39:54,635 --> 00:39:56,796
You killed my son,
you bastard!

870
00:39:56,871 --> 00:39:58,202
Don't Iisten to him.
Listen to us.

871
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,830
Killing him won't
bring Miguel back.

872
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:03,172
Maria, you have another son.
Think about Luis.

873
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:05,212
MARIA: He will be safe.
STABLER: But he won't
have a mother.

874
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:08,305
Now just put down the gun,
and this will all be over.

875
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:13,176
Come on, Maria,
make Luis proud.

876
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:17,013
Come on, Maria.

877
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:18,782
How bad?
It's killing me.

878
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,588
That's good.
It's just the knee.

879
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:21,753
I'II call EMS.

880
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:23,763
FIN: Where's Luis?
He's at my mother's house.

881
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:27,062
He was going for the gun,
the one he keeps
in the bedroom.

882
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,158
The bitch is a Iiar.

883
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:29,224
Shut up.

884
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:31,567
Maria, calm down. Calm down.
Look at me.

885
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:34,267
Look at me.
Where did you get the gun?

886
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:37,343
On the street.
I bought it.

887
00:40:43,884 --> 00:40:44,908
Come on.

888
00:40:48,222 --> 00:40:49,917
AIex, this is a big mistake.

889
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,582
Maria bought a gun
with our money.

890
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,286
To protect herself
and her son.

891
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,351
To assassinate
her ex-boyfriend.

892
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:56,418
(DOOR OPENING)

893
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,090
What's going on?

894
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,359
AIex wants to
indict Maria.

895
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,032
For what?

896
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:05,867
Attempted murder.

897
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,876
Are you kidding me?
Fredo terrorized Maria
and her sons for two years.

898
00:41:09,944 --> 00:41:11,912
That doesn't give her
the right to become
a vigilante.

899
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:14,243
This isn't about revenge,
AIex. It's self-defense.

900
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:16,977
No, OIivia, Fredo's gun
was two rooms away.

901
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:18,313
Unless Maria had
reason to believe

902
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:19,682
her Iife was
in immediate danger,

903
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:21,721
she had no justification
for shooting him.

904
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:23,689
How about
extreme emotional distress?

905
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:25,247
Doesn't apply here.

906
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:28,557
Maria knew exactly
what she was doing.

907
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:29,960
She dropped Luis off
at her mother's.

908
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,292
She ditched
the Bronx detectives.

909
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:33,060
She bought the gun,
and she went to kill Fredo.

910
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:36,034
We put her in that position
because we couldn't
protect her.

911
00:41:36,103 --> 00:41:38,003
No one could guarantee
Maria's safety 100%.

912
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:41,269
Look, she is scared
for her Iife and her boy's.

913
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:43,003
Maria committed a crime.

914
00:41:43,077 --> 00:41:47,343
Which we are
partly responsible for.
AIex, cut her a break.

915
00:41:48,616 --> 00:41:50,049
I have to enforce the Iaw.

916
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:54,076
Maria is your only eyewitness
to Fredo executing
Joey Stapleton.

917
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:56,088
Convict her
and her credibility is shot,

918
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:58,215
along with your murder case
against Fredo.

919
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:02,092
The Iaw is not
always about justice.
Your words, remember?

920
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:04,491
Maria didn't kill anybody.

921
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:07,796
But, Fredo, Fredo's got
two bodies to his name
that we know about.

922
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:11,065
We don't Iop
his head off now,
he will kill again,

923
00:42:11,138 --> 00:42:14,574
and if anything happens
to Maria or Luis,
it's on you.

924
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:28,714
Get on the bus, Mijo,

925
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:29,813
Okay.

926
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,255
Take care of yourself,
