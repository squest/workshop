00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:03,900
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:05,031
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:08,043
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:11,672
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,716
These are their stories,

7
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:14,941
(MUSIC PLAYING)

8
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:16,747
Tina, wait a sec.
I'm out.

9
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:20,482
What do you want me to do?
You've done enough.

10
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:23,684
I can't believe
you're making this up.
I saw you, Malcolm.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,557
You checked her out,
and then you got her number.

12
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:28,062
No, I didn't.
Empty your pockets.

13
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,395
Come on.

14
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:35,360
Hey, get out of here.

15
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:38,505
Sorry, man.

16
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:41,702
Malcolm, get out of the way.
You can get your coat Iater.

17
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:44,406
There was someone
on the bed. Now move!

18
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:49,542
MALCOLM: Dude went out
the window.

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,583
5'10" to 6', buck 90.

20
00:00:56,726 --> 00:01:01,322
Between 30 and 40 years old,
dark brown hair, brown eyes.

21
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:03,763
Any distinguishing marks?
No.

22
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,425
How'd you see all that?

23
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:09,028
You only had
a couple of seconds,
and it was dark.

24
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:11,801
We've been examining
eyewitness testimony
in mock court.

25
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:15,275
Most of the time
it's unreliable, and that's
why I wrote it all down.

26
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:17,904
You a Iaw student?
Third year, NYU.

27
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,107
You find him, I can ID him.

28
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:25,782
There's plenty of semen
and foreign hairs present.

29
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:28,722
She still out of it?
Tox screen
is positive for opiates.

30
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:32,591
There are needle marks
between her toes
and her upper thighs.

31
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:34,994
When can I talk to her?

32
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:37,464
In a while. I gave her some
Narcan to wake her up.

33
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:41,230
Detective, we have a problem
with the rape victim.

34
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:42,362
No ID?

35
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:46,670
No, we know who she is,
but I found something
in her purse.

36
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:52,044
What the hell is this?
A finger?

37
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:43,930
Does anybody know why
our rape victim was carrying
a human body part?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,627
Fin's at the hospital
waiting to ask.

39
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:48,295
Name's CIaire Rinato,
a 29-year-old heroin addict.

40
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:50,669
She's unemployed.
She Iives across the river.

41
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,208
Well, we know what
she was doing in the city?

42
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:54,265
Probably scoring.

43
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:57,801
She was arrested Iast year
for drug possession
and resisting.

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,508
It was bumped to a
misdemeanor probation
and court-ordered rehab.

45
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,984
Yeah. Her maternal
grandmother, Rose Rinato,

46
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:07,147
paid her fines,
assumed responsibility for her
granddaughter's compliance.

47
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:10,249
Well, I guess the rehab
didn't take. We got any
Ieads on our rapist?

48
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,692
I put the witness
with a sketch artist.
She should be done soon.

49
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:16,391
I'II make sure Fin
shows it to the victim.
If we're Iucky, she knows him.

50
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:17,864
I want an update from Warner.

51
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,869
And a New Jersey
search warrant
for the rest of the body.

52
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:27,264
Detective Fin Tutuola.
I'm here to
take your statement.

53
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:30,972
You?

54
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:34,778
Hospital has extras.
We had to keep your clothes
as evidence.

55
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,478
What kind of a name is Fin?
It's mine.

56
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:40,888
Remember anything
about your rape?

57
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:42,782
No.

58
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,225
What time did you
get to the party?
Around 11:00.

59
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:50,060
Go alone?
Guy I know told me about it.

60
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:52,532
We were supposed to hook up,
but he never showed.

61
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:55,366
What's his name?
It's not important.

62
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:59,605
He your dealer? Hey, we know
you Iike the needle.

63
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:02,940
We found it in your blood,
so don't even waste a Iie
on me.

64
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:07,173
Anybody bother you?
Pay too much
unwanted attention?

65
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,239
(EXHALES)

66
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:10,944
I didn't notice.

67
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,745
Who'd you score from?

68
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,884
I knew it.

69
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,917
You ever think the guy
might have slipped something
in on you on purpose?

70
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,732
A guy at the party
offered a sample.
Said he Iived there.

71
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:28,701
Okay. Let's go check on him,
see what he has to say.

72
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,600
Lose something?

73
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:38,840
My purse.
Yeah. I got that.

74
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:44,916
Do you always carry
a human finger around
in your bag?

75
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:52,253
I found it on the street
Iast night. I put it in
a baggie for safekeeping.

76
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:58,099
It's official.
The finger's dead.

77
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,292
For how Iong?

78
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:05,500
The mid-PIP has
partial epidermis and some
mummified tissue intact.

79
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:08,839
Without the rest of the body
and the temperature conditions
of its Iocation,

80
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:11,471
I'd have to guess, say,
10 to 12 years.

81
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:14,914
There may not be a body
if the victim says that she
found that on the street.

82
00:05:14,984 --> 00:05:19,045
No, she didn't.
There's no dirt
or signs of scavengers.

83
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:22,522
It didn't come from a
medical school or Iab because
there's no formalin present.

84
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,321
And the base of the finger
shows it was ripped
from the hand.

85
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,760
Then the body was stashed
somewhere that was protected.

86
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,391
Yes, and you need to find it
so I can tell you
how the baby died.

87
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:33,367
How young a child
are we Iooking for?

88
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:38,066
Caucasian between the ages
of 20 months and a Iittle
over two years.

89
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:48,045
You have access
to the common Iiving areas
and CIaire's room only.

90
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:49,880
You've been
through this before.

91
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:53,479
My granddaughter's having
a rough time trying to
reconnect with her mother.

92
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:55,183
Was CIaire visiting her
recently?

93
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:58,886
Over the weekend.
It didn't go well.

94
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,930
Is that why
she's using again?
Probably.

95
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:05,160
Whenever she
visits her mother,
there's usually a fight.

96
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:09,432
Why don't they get along?
Grace thinks
CIaire is just willful.

97
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:12,065
If she really
wanted to quit drugs,
she would.

98
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,803
Where does Grace Iive?
AIphabet City.

99
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,703
How bad is it?

100
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,578
What did CIaire do?
She was raped.

101
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,491
I'm going out,
so this'II have to be quick.

102
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:34,727
Did your daughter stay here
in the Iast couple of days?

103
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:39,427
That was the plan,
but we got into it, so she
decided to go elsewhere.

104
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,800
What'd you fight about?
Drugs.

105
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,976
Her complete Iack of control,
the company she keeps,
same old, same old.

106
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:54,546
What'd she do this time?
Your daughter
was recently raped.

107
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:00,684
Well, if CIaire was high,
then it's her own fault.

108
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,621
She was asking for it.

109
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,786
No one asks to be raped.

110
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:08,421
So if my cub
didn't do anything,
why are you here?

111
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:11,796
We've discovered
a child's decomposing finger
in her purse.

112
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,828
Any ideas where she got it?

113
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,302
A finger?

114
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,401
Did you ask CIaire?
She says she found it.

115
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,177
(SCOFFS) Strange as it seems,
she probably did,
knowing the company she keeps.

116
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:29,979
Is your daughter in the habit
of carrying around
human body parts?

117
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:31,178
Who can know with CIaire?

118
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:33,744
She's had so many problems
for so Iong,
it's hard to tell.

119
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:36,018
She's been in and out
of trouble,

120
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:38,889
she spent a year in juvenile,
she's tried every drug
they make.

121
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:42,055
I'm not surprised by anything
she does anymore.

122
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:44,493
FIN: Mr. Harding.

123
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,125
Here's the hump
that threw the party.

124
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:48,830
Is he the guy
that slipped you the sample?
No.

125
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:52,135
You the detective that called?
Yeah.

126
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,438
What's going on?
Looking for a rapist.

127
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,444
I already told the cops
I didn't do it.

128
00:07:56,512 --> 00:08:00,448
And when I catch the bastard
that did, what do you think
he's gonna tell me?

129
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:03,451
What's up, fellows?
OFFICER: Captain told us
to swing this by.

130
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:09,823
Come here.

131
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:15,395
You recognize him?
That's the guy with the tar.

132
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:17,898
Yeah. I saw him.
What's his name?

133
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,730
I don't know,
but he came with a waitress.

134
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:23,465
Name's Bella,
she works at the diner
a couple blocks away.

135
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,067
I need to ask about
a friend of yours, Bella.

136
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:34,448
You went to a party
Iast night, is that right?
What's his name?

137
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:37,279
He couldn't have
done anything.
He was with me.

138
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:39,253
He Ieave your side
for more than 10 minutes?

139
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:42,222
Yeah. We weren't
attached at the hip,
and it was a party.

140
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,952
He Ieave with you?

141
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,325
He said he had to
meet a client.

142
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:49,694
A woman was raped
at that party, and I
need to know his name.

143
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:57,402
Arthur Felton. He's a
car broker. At Ieast
that's what he told me.

144
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,906
He comes in here,
flirts with me. I thought
he was a nice guy.

145
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:04,838
(CAR HORN HONKING)

146
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:15,118
Sweet ride.
(CHUCKLES) You Fin?

147
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,317
Artie Felton.
Knew you'd Iike her.

148
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:20,487
Hey, Iet's take her
for a spin.
Tell me what you think.

149
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,155
Detective Odafin Tutuola.
What the hell's going on?

150
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,823
You have the right
to remain silent.

151
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,596
Anything you say can and will
be used against you
in a court of Iaw.

152
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:29,763
Felton processed?

153
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:32,136
On his way to the Tombs,
and his blood's at the Iab.

154
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:34,004
Good job.
I wish they were
all that easy.

155
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,407
The Iineup must
have been solid.

156
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:37,707
Well, the witness
did everything
but wrap him in a bow.

157
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,479
Sorry to blow your high,
but the DNA on the finger
came back a match.

158
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:47,086
To who?
Our rape victim,
CIaire Rinato.

159
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,523
I thought you caught
the guy who raped me.

160
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,688
We did.

161
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:59,427
We want to talk to you
about the finger
you've been carrying.

162
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:02,470
I've already
explained that to Fin.

163
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:06,797
You got any kids?
I wouldn't bring
a child into this world.

164
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,743
So you've never been pregnant?
How is that
any of your business?

165
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:13,043
We ran a DNA test on the bone.

166
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:16,110
It belongs to your
blood relative. Who?

167
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:21,188
CIaire, she and I
can be very patient.

168
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:25,124
You think you can Iast all day
with that knot churning
in your stomach?

169
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,802
Her name's Lisa.
She was my sister.

170
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:41,941
What happened to her?
I was 13 when she was born.

171
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:44,842
I took care of her.

172
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:49,376
I got her
ready in the morning,
dropped her at the sitter,

173
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:51,715
went to school, picked her up.

174
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:56,624
I fed her, gave her a bath,
did my homework,

175
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,255
sang songs to her,
taught her not to cry,
to never, ever cry.

176
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:07,268
And if she did?
My mother would hit her.

177
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:10,668
Crying drives her crazy.

178
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,741
How did your sister die?

179
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:19,305
I had to stay after school.

180
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:24,411
I called the sitter, asked her
if she could keep Lisa
till I could pick her up,

181
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:26,147
but she was busy.

182
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,712
So what happened
when you got home?

183
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:32,289
She was dead when I got there.

184
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,022
She probably cried for me
and Grace just snapped.

185
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,695
What did your mother tell you?
That it was an accident.

186
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:47,765
Lisa fell and hit her head.
I knew she was Iying.

187
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,847
CIaire, where's the body?

188
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:04,416
Grace stuck her in
an old trunk and put it
in the bedroom closet.

189
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,432
Why are you bothering me
at work? You could've
made an appointment.

190
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:17,666
God, how am I gonna
explain this to my supervisor?

191
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,264
Tell him the truth.
Which is?

192
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:21,707
We're investigating
a homicide.

193
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:23,108
Did something happen
to CIaire?

194
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:24,645
No. Your daughter's
at our precinct.

195
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:29,207
Did you have a child in 1986?
Why are you asking?

196
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:34,915
CIaire said that she had
a baby sister whose body
is stuffed in your closet.

197
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:39,159
And you believe that?
Why shouldn't we?

198
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,430
Because it's ridiculous.

199
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:46,195
Did you have another baby
after CIaire was born?

200
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:51,138
I've only had two children,
Detective.

201
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:55,267
One, a son who died
a Iong time ago,

202
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:58,438
and two, CIaire,
who's slowly killing herself.

203
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:04,151
Why would your daughter
Iie to us?
To get back at me.

204
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:07,416
Well, we certainly don't
mean to make the situation
between you two any worse,

205
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,957
but we have to check
these things out.

206
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,890
I guess.
We could always
search your home.

207
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,021
That would satisfy us
and CIaire. Maybe even
get her to face her problems.

208
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:19,023
I'm sorry, but I can't
allow you to invade my privacy

209
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:22,161
just because my daughter
told you a fairy tale.

210
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:26,637
Even if it might convince
your troubled daughter
to get some help?

211
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,040
If you had Iived
with CIaire's problems
as Iong as I have,

212
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:31,477
you would know
when to throw in the towel.

213
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:33,640
I need to get back to work.

214
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,287
We done here?
You got someplace to go?

215
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:40,685
I'm tired.

216
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:42,451
Well, we got some cots
back at the station.

217
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:44,617
No, thanks.
I'd Iike to go home.

218
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:48,094
Well, we need you to hang
around the city for another
day while we sort things out.

219
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:51,564
Fine. I'II be
at the Lydia Hotel in midtown.
You can find me there.

220
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:55,000
That's a junkie whore hotel.
They charge by the hour.

221
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,970
You're just Iooking to score.

222
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,876
I need to nod, or are you
offering to cop for me?

223
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:07,610
You don't scare me.
Not sporting
that retro ponytail.

224
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:15,521
You Iook Iike a pimp.

225
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:20,090
AII you need
is a feathered hat
and a crushed-velvet suit.

226
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,463
(SNIFFLING)

227
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,909
Stop it.
Just waiting on you
to turn it off.

228
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:34,070
You're hurting, so Iash out.

229
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:37,676
Say when, I'II try
to get you some help.

230
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,513
Next you're gonna tell me
you understand my pain.

231
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:43,645
No, not me. I didn't see
my sister stuffed into a box

232
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:46,589
and stored in the closet
Iike an old pair of shoes.

233
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:51,059
So you could cut me
some slack here.

234
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:54,792
Maybe can the Iecture
and Ieave me alone.

235
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,836
You Iike what you've become?
You Iike being a junkie,
CIaire?

236
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,030
Yeah.

237
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,906
Why no needle marks
for anybody to see? You stick
the needle between your toes.

238
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:08,272
Let go.

239
00:15:09,614 --> 00:15:12,981
Why hide it
if you're so proud of it,
if you Iike it so damn much?

240
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:16,282
It's the only time
I feel good about myself,
okay?

241
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,657
I can't see her face anymore,

242
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,761
except when I'm high.

243
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:34,071
How'd you make out
with CIaire?
Who knows?

244
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,039
She's got more demons
than most.

245
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:37,734
No wonder,
with a mother Iike that.

246
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:38,867
FIN: You Iean on her?

247
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:42,641
We asked nicely
to sweep and search,
Grace still refused.

248
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:46,673
But we've got an RMP close by
just in case she decides to do
a Iittle spring cleaning.

249
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:48,378
That doesn't mean anything.

250
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:52,048
Fin, I gotta tell you,
your attitude baffles me.

251
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:54,114
You either believe
CIaire's story or you don't.

252
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:58,219
Living with an addict's
a special kind of hell,
Ioving one's even worse.

253
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:02,130
I Iearned a Iong time ago
not to believe
most of the things they say.

254
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:06,698
Grace Rinato has agreed
to Iet the police
search her house.

255
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:08,798
She say when?

256
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:11,671
Tomorrow afternoon
when she gets home from work.

257
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:14,371
So go sit on her
in case she dumps it.

258
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:21,982
What is she waiting for?
Dead of night.

259
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:27,715
That smells good.
It is good. You want some?

260
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:31,261
I can't. Coffee runs
right through me.

261
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:34,162
FIN: (ON RADIO)
We're wasting our time,
The ho's probably asleep,

262
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,835
Well, I hope not
since I don't want to be
sitting here all night.

263
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:40,166
That's easy to do
in a nice warm car.

264
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:44,038
In another 10 minutes,
you're gonna have to
park your ass out here.

265
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:49,403
Okay. It's a go.
She's on the move.

266
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:16,504
FIN: She's on the street,

267
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:21,136
As soon as she drops it, check
the bag. You give us the all
clear, we'II pick her up.

268
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,374
She chucked it.

269
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:41,260
Take her.
I'II call the morgue, get CSU.

270
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:47,532
Grace Rinato,
you're under arrest
for the murder of Lisa Rinato.

271
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:50,165
Hey, I didn't kill anybody.
You have the right
to remain silent.

272
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:52,903
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of Iaw.

273
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:54,376
You don't understand.
I had to get rid of it.

274
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:55,777
I couldn't Iet anything else
happen to CIaire.

275
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,075
You have the right
to an attorney.

276
00:17:57,148 --> 00:17:59,013
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

277
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:00,745
PIease don't do this,
or my daughter'II go to jail.

278
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,980
It was an accident.

279
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:05,989
CIaire killed her baby sister
14 years ago.

280
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:11,452
You almost done
with the bones?

281
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:14,054
We're just degreasing
the Iast batch
with soapy water.

282
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:17,295
Wasn't a Iot of tissue Ieft,
so it didn't take Iong.

283
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:22,396
Dr. Phillip Devere,
he's our consulting
forensic anthropologist.

284
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:26,774
Fin. Thought you only used
facial recreations
to ID a body.

285
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,871
Well, there are no photos
of the victim, and you need
visuals for trial.

286
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:34,214
And it'II help connect
the jury with the Iittle girl.
I'II show you.

287
00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:40,957
Now, it used to take a few
days working with modeling
clay to sculpt a face.

288
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:44,859
But now, with this
new computer software,
it just takes a few hours.

289
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:49,229
AII right now,
I'm guessing at the eye color
and the flesh tone,

290
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,495
but at Ieast most of
her hair was still intact.

291
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:54,037
Am I too early
for cause of death?

292
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:57,632
For a written report, yes.
For my findings, no.

293
00:18:57,709 --> 00:19:03,477
AII right, now, she has
a compound fracture of the
Ieft scapula. It's shattered.

294
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:06,210
WARNER: Pay close attention
to the fracture pattern
of the ribs.

295
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:09,412
Most are cracked
and broken, perimortem.

296
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:11,717
The trauma is ventral
to dorsal,

297
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:14,121
in other words,
the blows Ianded
front to back.

298
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:15,682
Which means
she was kicked to death.

299
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,854
More Iike she was
Iying on her back
when the attack started

300
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,797
and turned defensively
on her right side.

301
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:24,494
This kind of damage,
she was stomped.

302
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:31,967
Can I smoke?
Maybe Iater.

303
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:35,706
I don't have any cigarettes.
I don't have my purse.

304
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,375
You said that CIaire
killed Lisa accidentally.
What happened?

305
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,045
CIaire had only been Iiving
with me for a couple months
when I got pregnant again.

306
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,486
So where's the baby's father?

307
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,684
We were a family for a while
until CIaire ran him off.

308
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,592
She was in and out of trouble,
and he couldn't take any more.

309
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,459
He didn't have to
since she wasn't his.

310
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,725
Where's CIaire's father?
Who knows?

311
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,858
Why wasn't Lisa born
in a hospital?

312
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:59,927
Because I wanted a home birth.
It's more natural.

313
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:02,666
Everything went fine.
Lisa was a healthy baby girl.

314
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,903
Right up until
you beat her to death.
CIaire did that.

315
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:11,313
She was always jealous
of Lisa. I doted on my baby
and CIaire hated that.

316
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:16,115
She used to
fly into these rages.
Jeez, I couldn't control her.

317
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:21,253
Fights at school, suspensions,
cops always at my door.

318
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,092
That girl was trouble
from the minute she was born.

319
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:27,495
What happened
the day Lisa died?

320
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:33,127
I contacted her father.

321
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:36,469
Thought it would
be good for Lisa
to have a relationship.

322
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,941
God knows,
girls need their dads.

323
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:42,813
We agreed
to work something out,
and CIaire overheard me,

324
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,348
started asking questions
about her own sperm donor.

325
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,714
AII right.
What did you tell her?

326
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:51,279
The truth.

327
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:54,291
That I've been with a Iot
of guys, and I didn't really
know who he was.

328
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:57,920
I thought she could
handle that.
So how did she react?

329
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:03,024
She seemed okay,
but the rage came Iater.

330
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:07,262
Where were you
when CIaire beat your
daughter to death?

331
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:11,572
Out.
BENSON: Out.

332
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,569
That's funny,
'cause CIaire said that
she was out, too.

333
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:17,843
Not Iikely, since she was
babysitting Lisa.

334
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:19,439
STABLER: Out on a date?

335
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:20,643
(SIGHING)

336
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:26,920
Okay, so I was in a bar
getting fixed up. Men
considered me very attractive.

337
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:29,582
They still do.

338
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:35,425
If you didn't trust CIaire
with Lisa, why would you
Ieave them alone together?

339
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,994
I didn't think she'd kill her.
Look, I'm not proud of myself.

340
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:44,597
When I got home
my baby was dead,
and CIaire was a wreck.

341
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:49,010
She said it was an accident.
She was always sorry
after her rages.

342
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,516
She needed help then,
and obviously
she needs it now.

343
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:59,185
So you stuffed the remains
of your youngest child
in a trunk to protect CIaire?

344
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,753
Why not get her help then,
when you knew she needed it?

345
00:22:02,827 --> 00:22:06,957
I did help her!
Her secret was safe
with me for 14 years.

346
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:08,692
Is that why you didn't
dump the body before?

347
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:12,224
Well, I couldn't risk
anyone finding it
and tracing it back to CIaire.

348
00:22:12,303 --> 00:22:16,239
With her juvenile record,
she would've gone
straight to prison.

349
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:19,507
Look, I'd already
failed her enough.

350
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:24,009
She's my daughter.
What else could I do?

351
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:26,380
Well, that's textbook
hump behavior.

352
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,646
Deny everything
and stick it
to the other guy.

353
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,847
I've got enough
to put Grace Rinato
away for murder.

354
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:33,254
She Iied to the police
and she dumped the remains.

355
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:35,189
Possession's being
nine-tenths and all.

356
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,989
Something
sticking in your craw?

357
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:42,922
Both suspects have an agenda.
Neither one of them
is exactly trustworthy.

358
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,231
We should do
a thorough background check
and find out who's Iying.

359
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:48,602
Well, Iet's just check
into Grace's statement,

360
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:51,608
Iook into CIaire's records
from her school,
juvenile facility.

361
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:55,407
We'II pull up the old 61s,
see if she's as much trouble
as her mother claims.

362
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,845
Well, it's up to you, AIex.

363
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:59,441
Do you want to vacate the
charges against Grace while we
try to nail her to the wall?

364
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:03,682
Not a chance. I've got enough
to go to trial.
Anything else is just gravy.

365
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:12,120
"Docket number 624353,
People v, Grace Rinato,

366
00:23:12,197 --> 00:23:16,031
"Two counts of Murder
in the Second Degree, Intent
and Depraved Indifference.

367
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:17,591
"One count

"One count Tampering

369
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:22,936
How do you plead?
Not guilty.

370
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:25,135
Remand, Your Honor.
That's ridiculous.

371
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,077
My client has permanent
residence. She's gainfully
employed by the state.

372
00:23:28,147 --> 00:23:29,239
She's not going anywhere.

373
00:23:29,314 --> 00:23:30,941
CABOT: The defendant
committed murder.

374
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:34,076
She willfully and maliciously
beat a two-and-a-half-year-old
child to death

375
00:23:34,153 --> 00:23:38,522
and then callously dumped
the remains in a bedroom
closet to avoid justice.

376
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,024
Do you propose
to try your case right here,
Miss Cabot?

377
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:43,721
No. I'm merely using rhetoric
to make my point.

378
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,856
One of your
more endearing qualities.
Approach.

379
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:54,499
There seems to be
some error here.

380
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:57,371
There is only one defendant.
There should be two.

381
00:23:57,443 --> 00:23:58,501
I don't understand.

382
00:23:58,577 --> 00:24:01,876
Your entire case rests upon
the word of the victim's
drug-addicted sister,

383
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:03,972
who I don't see
on my docket. Why is that?

384
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:06,279
The People aren't charging her
with Lisa Rinato's death.

385
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,683
Is there any corroboration?
No.

386
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:11,051
My client acted
to prevent her daughter,
CIaire,

387
00:24:11,123 --> 00:24:12,283
from being charged
with murder.

388
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:14,689
The defendant
had possession of the body.

389
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,423
If that's your only argument,
CIaire Rinato was also
in possession of body parts.

390
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:20,522
Well, if that's true,
then it stands to reason

391
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,591
that you would
charge CIaire Rinato
as a co-conspirator.

392
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,469
So I expect you to
bring charges before
the close of business today.

393
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,508
With all due respect,
Your Honor, you don't have
the right or the authority

394
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:34,910
to tell the District
Attorney's Office who or when
to Ievel charges against.

395
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,311
Step back.

396
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:45,284
The People
have requested remand.

397
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:47,587
Well, you're not gonna get it.
$300,000.

398
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:49,593
CABOT: Objection.
Overruled.

399
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:52,391
Your Honor, I must object.
Since you've rebuked me
for manipulating

400
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:55,433
the Iaw to my own advantage,
your ruling seems
hypocritical.

401
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:56,525
That's enough.

402
00:24:56,602 --> 00:24:59,628
One more word out of you
and you will be enjoying
my hospitality.

403
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:02,674
Ma'am, I urge you
to reconsider or you will
force me to file a grievance.

404
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:04,902
You're in contempt. Bailiff.

405

(DOOR BUZZING)

406
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:14,117
Lewin is making nice
with the judge
to get you out of here,

407
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:17,553
so be prepared
for that ass-chewing
phone call.

408
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:20,183
I'm not going anywhere.
Petrovsky crossed a Iine.

409
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:23,558
I want to get her censured
or thrown off the bench.

410
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,893
At Ieast you're not dull,
I'II say that for you.

411
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:29,331
Forget her, AIex.
She'II bury you.

412
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:32,996
I need your support, Liz.
For what?
So you can start a war?

413
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:35,266
You file a judiciary
grievance against her,

414
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,171
and every judge we face
will take it personally.

415
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:39,142
So what, she gets
to push us around?

416
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:41,771
She's not pushing us around,
she's pushing you.

417
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:45,146
AII the more reason
not to bait her.
How am I baiting her?

418
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:48,050
By refusing
to prosecute someone
I don't think is guilty?

419
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,385
I won't do it,
and she can't force me to.
But I can.

420
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:52,980
And I wouldn't be so quick
to pronounce

421
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:55,891
CIaire Rinato innocent
without all the facts.

422
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:59,260
SVU detectives found
that CIaire was prone
to uncontrollable rages.

423
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:02,994
It's all well-documented
by the school
and juvenile detention.

424
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:07,732
She attacked kids and had a
nasty habit of kicking them
while they were down.

425
00:26:11,243 --> 00:26:15,407
Are you ordering me
to file charges?
No. I already did it for you.

426
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:28,124
Thirty-four hours,
22 minutes and still clean.

427
00:26:28,193 --> 00:26:32,493
I'm dying,
just Iike my plants.
Gotta Iock you up, CIaire.

428
00:26:32,564 --> 00:26:34,191
Why?
You Iied.

429
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,290
About what?

430
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:38,063
About flying into rages
and attacking people.

431
00:26:38,136 --> 00:26:40,001
You there when
your sister was killed?

432
00:26:40,072 --> 00:26:42,973
I couldn't stop it.
It was already too Iate.

433
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,771
I gotta take you in, CIaire.

434
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:49,143
What's happening?
Stay out of it, Nana.
Let him do his job.

435
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:50,943
She's gonna be booked
and sent to the Tombs.

436
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:54,110
Arraignment'II be
day after tomorrow. Bail
will be set around $300,000.

437
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:56,916
You'II need 10%.
Can you get that?

438
00:27:03,862 --> 00:27:07,298
Miss Cabot.
My granddaughter
did not kill her sister.

439
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:11,330
With all due respect,
Mrs. Rinato, you didn't
even know she had one.

440
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:16,431
I was ill. It took me a Iong
time to recover. But I
raised CIaire. I know her.

441
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:20,501
You raised Grace as well.
Are you saying
she's capable of murder?

442
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,815
Mrs. Rinato, you need to see
the clerk just down the hall
to post CIaire's bail.

443
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:34,381
What's really going on here is
a young woman is paying
for your inability

444
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:35,858
to play well with others.

445
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:38,987
If nothing else,
you should recuse yourself.
Not gonna happen.

446
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:40,429
Your client was present
during the crime,

447
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:42,433
and she does have a history
of violent behavior.

448
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:45,163
Then charge her as a minor.
She was only 15 at the time.

449
00:27:45,237 --> 00:27:47,467
I'm sorry,
but my hands are tied.

450
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:50,633
Maybe a different judge
can untie them for you.

451
00:27:57,883 --> 00:28:01,114
You've got five minutes.
I'm all ears.

452
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,888
My client is running Iate,
Your Honor.

453
00:28:03,955 --> 00:28:06,321
My docket is full.
Define "Iate"'

454
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:08,682
I can't.

455
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,662
Was the defendant made aware
that the motion hearing
was scheduled for today?

456
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:15,598
A motion that you filed
on her behalf
to try her as a minor.

457
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:16,793
Yes, sir.

458
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:19,428
Did the People send notice?
We did.

459
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:23,832
Then where is she?
I don't know.

460
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:27,242
When was the Iast time
you actually spoke
with your client?

461
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:30,281
Your Honor, if there are
no objections, I would
be willing to reschedule.

462
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:32,714
A generous offer, Miss Cabot,
but totally unnecessary

463
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:37,016
since I'm issuing
a bench warrant for the
defendant's arrest right now.

464
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,924
You wanna tell me why
a bench warrant goes
city-wide for CIaire Rinato,

465
00:28:44,996 --> 00:28:48,454
and you couldn't
pick up the phone?
There wasn't enough time.

466
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:50,831
The judge issued the warrant
when she didn't
show up for court.

467
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:53,530
If you hadn't charged her
in the first place,
she wouldn't be in this mess.

468
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:55,402
That wasn't my call.

469
00:28:55,474 --> 00:28:58,604
CIaire Iied to us. I can't
ignore that. I don't think
you should, either.

470
00:28:58,678 --> 00:29:02,671
Can you buy me some time?
Why, do you know where she is?

471
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:05,684
I'm guessing this skank hotel
in midtown she Iikes.

472
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,487
She came in a while ago
and hasn't Ieft
since I've been on.

473
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:17,053
(MUSIC PLAYING)

474
00:29:17,597 --> 00:29:18,859
Damn it!

475
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:27,530
Yeah, this is
Detective Tutuola,
badge number 43198.

476
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:33,011
I need a bus at the
Lydia Hotel, midtown, Room
419, got a heroin overdose.

477
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:37,873
Come on. Don't do this.
Come on.

478
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,493
Damn you, CIaire.

479
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,874
Trying to take
the easy way out?

480
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,970
And if I was?

481
00:30:12,118 --> 00:30:15,053
Then it's too bad
I got there in time.

482
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:23,186
I really didn't mean
to overdo it, really.
That's what all junkies say.

483
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:26,527
You've done your good deed.
Now you can go.

484
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,066
Maybe you don't get it.

485
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:31,228
You're in serious trouble.
You don't pay attention,
you're going to prison.

486
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:32,566
Are you still here?

487
00:30:32,638 --> 00:30:36,005
I really can't believe,
you know, I almost bought it.

488
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:38,942
How you took care
of your sister and Ioved her.

489
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,411
Damn girl, you're better
than the soaps.

490
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,213
You have no idea what it feels
Iike to have a mother that
doesn't give a damn about you.

491
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:49,186
Violin's gonna
start any minute.
Screw you.

492
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:52,686
Lisa was all I had.

493
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:58,291
Oh, she was actually happy
to see me come
through the door.

494
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:03,230
Unconditional Iove is a rush.

495
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:09,734
Give it to me straight.
You kill her?

496
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:13,836
No.

497
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,877
But I couldn't protect her.

498
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:22,784
Grace was too strong.

499
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,424
She told me

500
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:31,986
that if I didn't keep
my mouth shut,

501
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,463
I was next.

502
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,428
You tell anybody?

503
00:31:37,536 --> 00:31:40,835
I called my grandmother
the first time I was alone.

504
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:46,969
But she was recovering
from another stroke

505
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:51,349
and I guess
she didn't believe me.

506
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:56,549
Well, if that's
how it went down,
then it wasn't your fault.

507
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:05,254
That Iittle girl
trusted me to keep her safe.

508
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:11,602
How is it not my fault?

509
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:21,944
CIaire's on her way back to
the Tombs. Is there anything
we can do to help her?

510
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:23,345
No, she's going to prison.

511
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:26,385
With her history of violent
rages, the jury's going
to believe that she is guilty.

512
00:32:26,452 --> 00:32:28,977
That's what you're going with?
She did it 'cause
you can sell it?

513
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:30,317
I'm not railroading her.

514
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:32,414
You just need a win
to get the boss
out of your ass.

515
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:34,618
You seem to have done a 180
all of a sudden.

516
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:36,855
Excuse me?
AIex.

517
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:40,592
If CIaire killed her sister,
she wouldn't have taken the
finger after all those years.

518
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:41,724
Well, I might
be able to sell that

519
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:44,998
if she had turned her mother
in or asked for help
or told someone.

520
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:48,507
She did tell somebody.
She told Grandma.

521
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:53,344
Grace had three kids.
Two are dead. Now I don't
Iike those odds, do you?

522
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:54,812
Maybe it's time to ask Rose
the hard questions.

523
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:57,111
And dig up the infant's body.

524
00:33:04,992 --> 00:33:08,450
Just so you know, if you're
Iooking for a miracle,
you'd better start praying.

525
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:12,020
The death certificate says
crib death. I'm just hoping
they missed something.

526
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:15,591
SIDS-related death
is an exclusionary
pathological finding.

527
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:18,001
So if a kid croaks
and the ME can't
find another reason,

528
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:20,505
it's Sudden Infant Death.

529
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:24,476
We call that idiopathic
when there's no clear
medical explanation.

530
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,206
Everyone experiences
sleep apnea.

531
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,440
You stop breathing
during the night,

532
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:30,915
but usually the body knows
when to start up again.

533
00:33:30,984 --> 00:33:34,147
SIDS babies don't know
when to breathe,
and we don't know why.

534
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,213
What if our suspect
smothered the kid
with a pillow?

535
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,954
I'd check the eyes,
but at 30 years plus,
I probably can't tell you.

536
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:45,294
Don't give up yet.
Just giving you the Iong odds.

537
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,935
While I was recuperating,
I didn't speak to CIaire.

538
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:54,098
She'd upset me
wanting to come
Iive with me again.

539
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:56,608
And I barely spoke
to her mother.

540
00:33:57,177 --> 00:34:00,806
I could never get
a straight answer.
Straight answer about what?

541
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:05,818
How CIaire was adjusting
to Iife with her. I'm only
here to vouch for CIaire.

542
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,383
You don't Iike Grace.

543
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:13,048
She's my daughter,
Detective. I Iove her.

544
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:15,856
It's not her fault
she's Iike she is.

545
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,921
She's had problems
from the day her father Ieft.

546
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:21,365
So CIaire didn't fit in
with her Iifestyle.

547
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:25,235
The situation
required an adjustment
for both of them.

548
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:29,540
But I was concerned
because Grace isn't patient.

549
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:35,076
Is that what happened with
the first baby? Was her Iack
of patience the issue?

550
00:34:37,017 --> 00:34:39,542
What are you getting at,
Detective?

551
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,688
What happened
the night he died?
Nothing.

552
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:46,817
We went to sleep as usual.

553
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:50,357
I got up
in the middle of the night
to check on Anthony.

554
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,728
The crib was in Grace's room.

555
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,997
When I got there,
he was already blue.

556
00:34:58,405 --> 00:35:00,430
Why did you check on him?

557
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:05,342
Well,
Grace was a young mother.
She didn't know anything.

558
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:08,745
Stands to reason
I would help her
with the baby.

559
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,307
Yes, but the baby
was two months old
when it died.

560
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:13,875
Why didn't she have
a handle on it by then?

561
00:35:13,954 --> 00:35:17,048
He was colicky.
Cried all the time.

562
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:21,752
Nothing worked.
We spent our nights
walking him.

563
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:26,288
We were told that your
daughter can't stand crying,
that it makes her crazy.

564
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,429
Excuse me, how is this
going to help CIaire?

565
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,736
Ma'am, no one can help
your granddaughter.
She's going to prison.

566
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:39,211
Why? She didn't do it.
You have to believe that.

567
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:43,875
AII a jury has to hear
is that CIaire's violent, and
she's doing 25-to-Iife, easy.

568
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:48,281
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

569
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:59,864
Fin just called.
Warner can't find a thing
to support infanticide.

570
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:03,698
The hyoid wasn't broken?
That'd be too easy.

571
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,831
She probably smothered him
with a blanket.
I'm out of suggestions.

572
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:12,736
Let Mrs. Rinato
talk to Grace in Rikers.
Why?

573
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:15,979
We don't have evidence.
We're gonna need a confession.

574
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,950
I think Rose is ready
to fall on her sword.

575
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:25,622
If the purpose
of this Iittle gathering
is a digging expedition,

576
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:27,785
we can stop right here.
It's a separate issue.

577
00:36:27,861 --> 00:36:30,625
We are within our rights
to interrogate

What about him?
Stop. Who's Anthony?

You can't do that.

Can they just dig up
my son Iike that?

Oh, you promised me, Mama.

You swore when Daddy Ieft
you'd Iook after me.

595
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:41,097
Since you were the one
that drove him away.

596
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:45,228
That man was a Iousy husband
and horrible father.

597

I don't know why he never
kept in touch with you.

598
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:51,308
Maybe he saw
something ugly in you,

00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:54,745
something I couldn't face
until now.

No. That's not true.
He Ioved me!

601
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:03,081
It was your fault. You
kept him from me. You're just
bitter 'cause he dumped you.

Grace, I'm tired of the guilt.

She never killed anyone,
Grace.

608
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:34,652
She never covered
her son's face
to stop his crying

609
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:37,952
and watched him
struggle for his Iast breath.

610
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,259
I didn't kill him, you did.

611

just one night, but, no, you
had to teach me a Iesson.

You wanted that baby,
you were damn well
gonna take care of him.

00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:52,137
He was your responsibility.
I never wanted him.

when Daddy Ieft?

to put him in that crib
and wait to call the doctor?

Hers. Isn't
my mother brilliant?

00:39:06,954 --> 00:39:09,013
I did that to protect you.

619
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:14,990
I wasn't the best mother.
You needed so much.

I just could never
fill that hole in you.

621

But you jumped through
hoops for CIaire.

622
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:24,068
You thought she was
your second chance
to get it right.

Well, she's a junkie, Ma,
so you still screwed up.

you'd kill again.

626

The only reason CIaire's alive
is that I took her from you.

so the neighbors
