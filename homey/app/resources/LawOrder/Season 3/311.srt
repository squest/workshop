00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:00,231
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:03,966
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,166
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:08,142
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:11,772
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,748
These are their stories,

7
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:16,745
You're being ridiculous.
You're being ridiculous.

8
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:19,879
Excuse me? You practically
got into a fistfight
with the parking guys.

9
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:21,685
So I'm just supposed
to Iet them rip us off?

10
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:24,022
SUVs cost more to park.
Didn't you read the sign?

11
00:00:24,093 --> 00:00:25,458
It didn't say 45 bucks.

12
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:28,224
That's an entire dinner
at Fort Lee,
including parking.

13
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:30,231
Now there's gonna be traffic
on the GW.

14
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:31,459
I hope you had fun tonight.

15
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:33,559
MELANIE: You obviously didn't.

16
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,267
Kevin.
What?

17
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:36,896
The door is all wet.

18
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,736
Damn it, I just had it washed.

19
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:41,773
What did you get on my car?

20
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:43,778
I don't know.
I got a Ieaky pipe up there.

21
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:45,871
I don't know.
MELANIE: What is this?

22
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,044
Oh, God!

23
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:50,983
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

24
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,820
That was quick from Queens.

25
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,552
I stayed in the city tonight.

26
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:57,985
What do we know?

27
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:59,926
Parking attendant found her
on the second Ievel,

28
00:00:59,996 --> 00:01:01,463
naked from the waist down.

29
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:03,863
IDed from her purse.
Nicole Manning.

30
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,367
There's no robbery.
60 bucks cash
Ieft in her wallet.

31
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:07,562
How's she doing?

32
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:09,628
She's alive,
but it's a real mess.

33
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:11,731
She conscious?
EMT 1: In and out.

34
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:13,969
Got bashed in her head
pretty good.

35
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:16,409
We got a description
on the perp?
Nothing yet.

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,605
EMT 2: Better get one quick.

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,341
I'II ride.
STABLER: Okay.

38
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:24,344
CSU says condition
of her blood at the scene

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,854
Iooks Iike she was attacked
minutes before she was found.

40
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:28,788
How many stab wounds?

41
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,493
She wasn't stabbed, Detective.

42
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,725
Pressure's dropping.
EMT 2:
Come on, Nicole, stay with us.

43
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:39,632
Two Iarge-bore IVs,
02, 15 Iiters,
non-rebreather mask.

44
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:42,193
She's C-spined,
sinus tach at 150.

45
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,296
Nicole, did you get
a Iook at him?

46
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:46,204
EMT 2: She's seizing.
Two of Ativan.

47
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,869
Trauma to the head,
pupils equal,
round and reactive.

48
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:51,539
Patient sustained
massive abdominal trauma.

49
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:54,174
Looks Iike emergency
C-section to me.

50
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,945
This woman was pregnant?

51
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:58,509
EMT 2: No pulse. Start CPR.

52
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,754
Any sign of the baby?
Not yet.

53
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,984
What the hell
did he do with it?

54
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,257
Sick son of a bitch
must have taken it with him.

55
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:58,307
Cut was made with a dull
or serrated blade.

56
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:01,646
Head trauma, multiple
contusions around the abdomen,
Iike she'd been kicked.

57
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:02,945
Anything from the rape kit?

58
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,452
Positive for fluids.

59
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,249
What are her chances?
Not good.

60
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:08,290
Developed an amniotic
embolism.

61
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:11,087
CIots in her Iungs
cut off oxygen to the brain.

62
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,593
Any word on the baby?
Not yet.

63
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:14,095
Guy could have
dumped that body anywhere.

64
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:15,687
Or kidnapped it.
Kidnapped?

65
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:17,323
Well, at this age,
it's viable.

66
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,493
Mother's at 28 weeks,
baby was normal weight,

67
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,866
no apparent complications.

68
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:23,804
You think it's possible
this baby could be out there
somewhere alive?

69
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:26,273
It's possible,
but not for Iong.

70
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:30,003
She was by herself.
I didn't even think
to go with her.

71
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,307
This is a safe neighborhood.

72
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,745
Who else was up there?

73
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:34,214
Usually nobody but me.

74
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:35,580
Then why was she?

75
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,677
Well, Mrs. Manning,
she's a monthly.
She always gets her own car.

76
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:42,019
Okay, did you hear anything?
Maybe you hear
a woman screaming?

77
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,025
No, no, no. I would have
checked on that.

78
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,822
What about someone
Ieaving the building?

79
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:48,056
Maybe carrying a bag
or something wrapped up
in a coat?

80
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,655
No. No, no.

81
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,963
But there's another way down
from the second floor.

82
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:56,095
The stairs,
they Iead onto the back alley.

83
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,539
Hey, what's the Iatest?

84
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:02,803
Still waiting
to talk to the husband.
Any Ieads on the baby?

85
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,642
Got every available cop out
canvassing the neighborhood.

86
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,182
That's him.

87
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,084
Whoever did this,
it was personal.

88
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,285
Can't rule him out.

89
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:18,356
We were supposed to meet
for dinner at 7:00.

90
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:21,055
I waited at the restaurant.

91
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,362
She's usually Iate,
so I didn't worry right away.

92
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,562
CRAGEN:
What about before that?

93
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:30,231
I was in a session
with a patient.

94
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:34,741
You're a doctor?
Psychiatrist.
My practice is in midtown.

95
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:39,613
Dr. Manning,
there's no easy way
to ask you this.

96
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:43,516
Were you intimate
with your wife
during the past 24 hours?

97
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:46,020
No. Why?

98
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,281
We think that your wife
may have been assaulted.

99
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:52,327
We'd Iike to ask
for a blood sample from you.

100
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:55,158
Of course. Anything you need.

101
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:59,030
What did you do when your wife
didn't show up
at the restaurant?

102
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:03,561
I tried calling her.
And, after an hour,
I went home.

103
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:07,642
BENSON: Can you think of
any reason that somebody
would want to hurt Nicole?

104
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,302
No.

105
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:12,779
Nicole was a good person.
She is.

106
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:14,213
Nicole is a good person.

107
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:17,616
The doctor said there's still
a chance she'II recover.

108
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:27,694
PIenty of prints off her car.
After we rule out
the parking staff,

109
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:32,723
the victim's friends
and family, and every valet
in the city, who knows?

110
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,270
We just might get Iucky.
This car's for sale.

111
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,034
We're not gonna get too Iucky
if she had people
test-driving it.

112
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:39,574
What about signs of the baby?

113
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:41,507
Lot of blood.
Don't know whose yet.

114
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:44,842
No placenta or cord.
Took everything with him.

115
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:47,849
Looks Iike he got in
and out through there.

116
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:50,618
CIeaned up before he Ieft.

117
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:54,178
With those slimy antibacterial
hand wipes. He came prepared.

118
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:56,247
He gets rid of the blood,

119
00:05:57,093 --> 00:06:00,756
Ieaves out that door.
It's Iike nothing
ever happened.

120
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,590
But why take the baby?

121
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:04,064
Maybe that was the reason
for the attack.

122
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:07,694
He didn't want the woman dead.
He wanted her to suffer.

123
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:12,172
BENSON: Husband's
credit card records confirm
he was at the restaurant.

124
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:15,039
Cell phone records coincide
with the calls he made
Iooking for his wife.

125
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,341
Preliminary on the rape kit
rules him out anyway.

126
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,677
Husband's AB-positive,
perp's O-negative.

127
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:22,081
What did Latent turn up
in the victim's car?

128
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:25,245
Just got a solid hit from
prints, interior and exterior.

129
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:26,378
Kyle Novacek.

130
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:27,479
Not a complete Iunatic,

131
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:30,184
but did time for assault three
and heroin possession.

132
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,523
Don't really see that kind
of violence with heroin users

133
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:35,462
unless somebody slipped him a
hotshot and mixed in some PCP,

134
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:36,828
guy could've gone psycho.

135
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,129
Well, get on him. That baby
might still be alive.

136
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:42,500
The victim is an RN
at a methadone clinic.
That can't be a coincidence.

137
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,005
But might be the connection
between them.

138
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:46,974
Hey, Maureen.
Hey.

139
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:50,008
Dad?
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

140
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,838
Can I talk to you, please?

141
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:54,942
Come on.

142
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,609
Go ahead. Use my office.

143
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:04,156
So we'II hit
the methadone clinic. Novacek
could have been a client.

144
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:06,023
We talk to area hospitals?

145
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:09,394
No premature newborns
admitted yet, but
the hospitals are on alert.

146
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:10,864
Well, what did the search
turn up?

147
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,594
The neighborhood canvass
was a complete bust.

148
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:16,661
Nothing at the airports,
bus terminals. Still waiting
to hear on the PATH trains.

149
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:20,869
We'II have to
widen the search.
I'II use another phone.

150
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,881
So how's school going,
Maureen?
It's fine.

151
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:35,856
Yeah? You get your college
applications out yet?

152
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:38,120
Pretty much.
You're gonna be Iate.

153
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:40,662
Okay. Bye, OIivia.

154
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:45,490
Everything okay?
Yeah.

155
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:47,800
You ready?

156
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,211
MUNCH: Kyle Novacek?
What, I'm on every
cop's Iist now?

157
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,009
Third time this year
with you guys.

158
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:03,108
You wanna be Ieft alone,
don't stab your smack dealer
in the forearm.

159
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:05,312
I'm working steady now.
I'm clean.

160
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:07,514
Got nothing to do
with that Iife anymore.
That all you wanna know?

161
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,457
Not even close.
Where were you Iast night?

162
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:12,988
I take a class
at Brooklyn College.

163
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:14,290
A man of intellect.

164
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:17,491
What time's the class start?
7:00. Before that,
here till 6:00.

165
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:20,831
What kind of car you drive?
I don't. Car died Iast week.

166
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,866
That's a shame.
Looking for a new one?

167
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,100
Gold Ford parked in a garage
a few blocks away,

168
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:28,405
some interesting fingerprints.

169
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:32,514
That's the car I Iooked at.
I saw a sign in the window.

170
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,344
The woman Iet me take it
for a drive Iast week.

171
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,543
What, did somebody steal it?
FIN: How'd the program go?

172
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,314
What program?
The methadone treatment.

173
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:39,786
You know, sometimes they don't
give you enough.

174
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:41,379
You need a Iittle more
to make it through the day.

175
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:44,358
What's this all about?
Did she get hurt?

176
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:46,291
Do you even
remember Iast night
or were you too Ioaded?

177
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:50,230
Look, I already told you,
I saw the car once.
I haven't been back since.

178
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,459
Where is it?
What?

179
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:53,900
The baby.
What the hell
you talking about?

180
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:56,563
It's alive, you can still
get out of this
without a broken neck.

181
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,335
You telling me
somebody hurt that baby?
Take the DNA test.

182
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,241
You didn't touch her,
we Ieave you alone.

183
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:08,716
I don't have to do that.
Sound Iike a guilty man to me,
Novacek.

184
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:11,344
I just know the way
you guys operate.

185
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,481
If you had anything on me,
my ass would be in the back
of your car already, right?

186
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:16,547
Anything else?

187
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,717
Count on it.

188
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:27,064
CAROL: You know methadone
client Iists are confidential.

189
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:30,003
We give their names out
to police, they never come in
for treatment.

190
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:32,302
How about I show you
the ER photos
they took of Nicole Manning?

191
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:34,672
That change your mind?
Her baby might still be alive,

192
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:37,007
but we are running
out of time.
I wish I could help.

193
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,014
Well, you do have armed guards
and surveillance videos.

194
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:42,107
I'm sure not all of your
clients are perfect angels.

195
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:43,776
Have any of your employees
ever been harassed?

196
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:47,083
On a daily basis,
but nothing overtly violent.

197
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:48,418
BENSON: What about
in the neighborhood?

198
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,583
I'd imagine this place
attracts some real winners.

199
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,526
Actually, the only person
we've had a problem with
is another nurse,

200
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,585
Erin Sena.

201
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:57,427
Nicole found out
she'd been diverting
methadone for herself.

202
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,364
What happened to Erin?

203
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:03,233
I'm required to report
all incidents to the police.

204
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:07,002
She was arrested.
She Iost her job
and her nursing Iicense.

205
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,375
BENSON: Nice place.

206
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:11,603
I cleaned up
especially for you.

207
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,648
Your boyfriend
doesn't mind the mess?

208
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:15,809
Who says I've got a boyfriend?

209
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:19,582
Come on, a girl Iike you.
I'm sure you have a few.

210
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,791
You coming on to me?
I'm into that.

211
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,390
Your friend can watch.
AII right.

212
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:31,331
Why don't we start by having
you sit down and answer
a few of my questions?

213
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,389
Okay?

214
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:36,268
Nicole Manning.
You seen her Iately?

215
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:37,362
Yeah.

216
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:40,305
We hang out all the time
and have tea.

217
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:41,968
BENSON: She screwed you over,
didn't she?

218
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:45,980
Got arrested, Iost your job.
She's the reason
that your Iife sucks, right?

219
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,312
So?
This is what I'm thinking.

220
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:51,410
You and your boyfriend follow
Nicole Manning
into the parking garage.

221
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,682
You have a fight,
it gets a Iittle out of hand,

222
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:56,350
your boyfriend goes crazy,
not your fault.

223
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:58,450
I don't have a boyfriend.

224
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:02,295
You have to Ieave now.

225
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,728
STABLER: What's that?
None of your business.

226
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,768
Do you have a son, Erin?

227
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:09,661
They took him away from me.

228
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:10,762
They who?

229
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,441
Two cops and some bitch
from Social Services

230
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,741
think they know
how to take care of my own son
better than me.

231
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:19,474
Must have been jealous
of Nicole.

232
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:23,712
The woman who took everything
from you, and now she's
having her own baby.

233
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,083
Get out.

234
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,849
You still using? Yeah, we are.

235
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:31,052
Look, I gotta tell you
that no agency is gonna
give a junky back her kid.

236
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:32,286
Yeah? Screw you.

237
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,420
That baby needs to be
in a hospital, Erin.

238
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:36,430
Now, we can help you.

239
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:37,897
No, you can't.

240
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,633
Nicole pissed off
the wrong person.
Look what happened to her.

241
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,500
Who'd she piss off?

242
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:46,197
I don't know.
Yeah, I think you do.

243
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,612
Only thing I know is
Nicole asked for it,
and she got what she deserved.

244
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:54,942
I had nothing to do with it.

245
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,382
Now, get out.

246
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,956
Someone scared the hell
out of her to shut her up.

247
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:10,225
Partner in crime.

248
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,631
We need to get back in there
and search for signs
of that baby.

249
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,828
Right. Stabler.

250
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:18,771
We're on it.

251
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:22,573
CRAGEN:
Take him down to the shelter.
Get him something to eat.

252
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,703
Yeah, thank you very much.

253
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:29,076
Homeless guy reported it.
Says he didn't
see anybody around.

254
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:30,812
Where?
Dumpster.

255
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:42,155
We positive
it's the Manning baby?
Right size.

256
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:44,665
Decomposition fits
the time frame.

257
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:48,831
Sorry, Detectives.

258
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:54,841
What was it?

259
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,769
Little boy.

260
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:09,888
MANNING: I should probably
make some arrangements,
I don't know.

261
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,950
Am I supposed to get
a birth certificate issued
first before...

262
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:14,427
You don't have to do anything
right now.

263
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:17,397
Actually, the Medical Examiner
is gonna need a Iittle time
to investigate.

264
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,934
Well, I'd Iike to take care
of things before she wakes up.

265
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,266
We know this is
a very difficult time for you,

266
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,168
but we need to ask you
about another nurse

267
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,799
that your wife worked with.
Erin Sena.

268
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:29,576
Oh, yeah, I know the name.

269
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:33,741
She tried to get Nicole
to testify on her behalf
at some hearing.

270
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:36,307
I think the state was trying
to take away her son.

271
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:38,046
Did she testify?
No.

272
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,021
No, Nicole thought
it was Iudicrous
of the girl to even ask.

273
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:42,716
So what happened?

274
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,590
Well, she screamed
at our answering machine
a few times,

275
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:47,492
and I wanted to
call the police,

276
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,430
but Nicole
wouldn't hear of it.

277
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:52,899
She thought
it was unnecessary.

278
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,196
She doing any better?

279
00:13:58,307 --> 00:13:57,537
They performed a hysterectomy.

280
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:02,041
How do I tell her that
we'II never have a family?

281
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,048
WARNER:
Depressed skull fractures
along the right temporal Iobe,

282
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,985
extensive contusions.

283
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:14,924
Cause of death was a subdural
hematoma resulting from
blows to the head.

284
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:17,518
Whoever did it did not want
this baby to Iive.

285
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:20,258
Perp kicked the mother
before removing the baby.

286
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:22,323
Could the head trauma
be from the beating?

287
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,200
No way to tell if the injuries
were sustained
in- or ex-utero.

288
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:30,401
But once the fetus was
aborted, no apparent effort
was made to save it.

289
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,368
How Iong did he Iive?

290
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:36,311
Still trying
to determine that.

291
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:38,881
If there's a God,
it wasn't Iong.

292
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:42,317
Kyle Novacek's alibi
cleared him.

293
00:14:42,387 --> 00:14:44,412
That Ieaves Erin Sena
as our only suspect,

294
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:47,185
assuming we can find the man
who was her partner in crime.

295
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:50,023
I want options. Now, how else
can we get to her?

296
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,255
Probation violation.

297
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,024
She was higher than a kite
when we talked to her.

298
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:54,429
We haul her in
for a drug test.

299
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,332
Judge made random testing
a requirement
for her probation.

300
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:59,393
She fails the test,
we got Ieverage
to make her talk.

301
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:00,995
Now all we got to do
is find her.

302
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:02,471
She in methadone treatment?

303
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,202
Her PO says she's a client
at Tenth Avenue
where she used to work.

304
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:09,111
Well, that's one appointment
a heroin addict's
always gonna keep.

305
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:13,206
You think we missed her?

306
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:14,650
She needs her fix.

307
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:18,987
Could've gotten it
this morning.
No, she's coming.

308
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:21,287
You want to Ieave, go ahead.

309
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:26,296
Or you could just stop being
a jerk and tell me what
the hell's going on with you.

310
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,063
This about Maureen?

311
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:36,469
I screwed up.
I didn't send in a check
for the Columbia application.

312
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:38,903
Is it too Iate?

313
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:41,669
I don't know.

314
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,743
EIIiot, what is this?

315
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,747
I've been distracted.

316
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:50,919
That's her.

317
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:55,218
Where you off to?

318
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:56,817
Oh, just Iet me go in.

319
00:15:56,895 --> 00:16:01,594
Right after your drug test.
Oh, please, just Iet me...
Let me just go in!

320
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,763
You tested positive
for heroin.

321
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,967
Fine. Arrest me.

322
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,442
There's no rush, really.
We got, what, 24 hours?

323
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:14,569
STABLER: Yeah, give or take.

324
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,911
I really, really need
to get out of here, okay?

325
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:20,178
Yeah, what happened
to your face?

326
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:21,275
I got hit.

327
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:23,880
Someone's fist, Iooks Iike.

328
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,588
Can I have a soda?
Can you do that?

329
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,719
Soon as you tell us
who you've been
hiding from, sure.

330
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:32,023
No, no. No way.

331
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:33,860
Then you're going down
for everything, Erin.

332
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,365
Cutting Nicole
and killing her baby.

333
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,230
STABLER: Trained nurse.
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

334
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:38,462
It all points to you.

335
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:41,630
I told you, I didn't have
anything to do with it!

336
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,901
But you're a Iiar, Erin,
and everybody knows it.

337
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,169
Nicole knew it.

338
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:47,234
She has everything,
and she comes after me?

339
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:48,301
Exactly.

340
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,871
She has everything you want,
and you made her pay for it.

341
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,315
I didn't.
Yeah, but someone did.

342
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:57,515
Who was it? Come on,
your boyfriend? Some junkie
you met on the street?

343
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,251
BENSON: You're afraid
that he's going to hurt you,
just Iike he did Nicole.

344
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,225
Who're you hiding from?

345
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:05,322
Who is he, Erin?

346
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:08,190
Kyle.

347
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,867
Kyle Novacek's your boyfriend.

348
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,707
Hers. Nicole's.

349
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:22,006
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

350
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:25,715
We got a communications
problem, Kyle.

351
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,945
We keep asking you questions,
and you keep Iying.

352
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,919
I didn't Iie. I told you
where I was that night.

353
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:32,616
Half the guys in Sing Sing
got alibis.

354
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,185
Come on, Iook. Wait a second.

355
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,161
I'II tell you the truth.
We don't care about the truth.

356
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,753
We're gonna take you in
for a Iittle DNA test,

357
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,594
prove you raped her.
That's all the truth we need.

358
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,760
The test's gonna be positive.
Nicole and I made Iove
that afternoon.

359
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,428
You raped her,
you cut her open.

360
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:48,495
Then you beat up another woman
to keep her mouth shut.

361
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:49,870
I knew you'd think
I was guilty.

362
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,967
Well, that's 'cause you are,
you sick bastard.
You killed the baby.

363
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:54,477
It was mine.

364
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:58,009
The baby was mine.

365
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:01,683
Would I do that
to my own child?

366
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:06,748
STABLER: Where is Novacek?

367
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:08,452
Crying his eyes out in One.

368
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,619
CSU's Iooking for the weapon
at his place.

369
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:12,162
Waiting on the semen match,

370
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,357
and we threw in
a paternity test on the baby.

371
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,161
Doesn't prove he's innocent.

372
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:19,965
She's seeing Novacek
on the side, gets pregnant,
won't Ieave her husband,

373
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:21,335
Novacek decides to punish her.

374
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:22,998
Or maybe the husband did it.

375
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:26,874
Novacek says that Manning
was probably catching on.

376
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:29,807
He never mentioned
anything about it.

377
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,213
Which means he didn't know
or he didn't want us to know.

378
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:34,615
Ask the wife.
She just woke up.

379
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:39,352
I remember something
hitting me in the back
of the head, that's all.

380
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:41,619
I didn't even see who did it.

381
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:45,119
I woke up here,

382
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,331
and they told me
what happened.

383
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:53,663
Tell us about Kyle Novacek.

384
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,811
I suppose you know already.
I've been seeing him
almost a year.

385
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:06,142
Did you see him
the night of your attack?

386
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:07,241
No.

387
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:10,481
I saw him earlier
that afternoon.

388
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:15,053
That's really the only time
we can be together.

389
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:17,526
I know how bad this sounds.

390
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:22,259
Had you two argued recently?
You can't think he did this.

391
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,092
Kyle wanted to get married.

392
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,228
STABLER: Did you?

393
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:29,501
I told him I would,

394
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:34,967
but everything changes
when you're having a baby.

395
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:39,506
It's about what's safest,
not what's going to
make you happy.

396
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:42,919
And you felt it was safest
to stay with your husband.

397
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:45,512
Did he know about you
and Kyle?

398
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,991
I told him
that I was Ieaving him

399
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,992
and that the baby wasn't his.

400
00:19:53,698 --> 00:19:55,723
How did he react to that?

401
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,125
I thought he would be angry,

402
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,404
but, at the time,
he was really calm.

403
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:03,599
Your husband said
that you were meeting
for dinner at 7:00.

404
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:06,371
Did he know that
you were running Iate?

405
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:09,576
I was meeting him at 7:30.

406
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:13,741
Did Richard tell you 7:00?

407
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,981
Why wasn't the husband
a suspect to begin with?

408
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,186
'Cause none of the evidence
pointed to him.

409
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:24,592
What do we know
about this guy?

410
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:27,563
Well, he's a shrink,
so he knows how to mess
with your head.

411
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:28,621
Not you.

412
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,133
No, you're exactly right.

413
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:33,136
What's more, psychiatrists
go through four years
of medical school

414
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:35,069
and a one-year
medical internship.

415
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,232
So he'd know how to do
a crude C-section.

416
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:39,572
I want Dr. Manning's
alibi broken.

417
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:42,010
Timewise, it's tight,
but there's room
for maneuvering.

418
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,208
Restaurant receipt says
that Manning
had a drink at 6:59.

419
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:47,478
The bartender remembers him,
but he didn't see him Ieave.

420
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:48,951
Two calls from his cell phone.

421
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,649
One at 7:50, the other at 7:52
to Nicole's cell
and their home.

422
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:55,659
Now, Manning claims
that he was still
at the restaurant waiting.

423
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,718
Unless he was across town
attacking his wife.

424
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:00,161
The cell phone company
would have a better idea
of where he was

425
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:02,131
when he made those calls.
We'II check on that.

426
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,395
Neighbor said Manning got in
before 8:30.

427
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:07,700
Hour at the restaurant, plus
walking time. It's plausible.

428
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:10,138
Nicole didn't get
to the garage until 7:20.

429
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,143
Because Richard told her
that they were meeting
at 7:30.

430
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:14,678
We're thinking that
it's deliberate,

431
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:17,681
so he'd know exactly where
she'd be and still have time
to set up his alibi.

432
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:19,114
One hour window, tops.

433
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:23,984
Crosses the park, attacks her,
cleans up, goes back home.

434
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:26,890
AII because his wife was
carrying another man's child.

435
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,825
Well, you know,
it could've been enough
to push him over the edge.

436
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:33,091
He was cuckolded.
It's pretty common.
You see it in nature.

437
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:35,223
The female of the species
seeks out the male

438
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,598
who exhibits
the most desirable traits.

439
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:41,070
You know, most species
aren't naturally monogamous.

440
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,198
That explains
my entire marital history.

441
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:47,836
Let's knock off the jokes,
all right? We're talking about
a dead baby here.

442
00:21:50,214 --> 00:21:52,739
AII right, his wife cheats
on him. Why not kill her?

443
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:56,548
Because, you see, in his mind
the problem was the baby,
not his wife.

444
00:21:56,621 --> 00:22:00,113
Get rid of the baby,
get rid of the problem.
His world remains intact.

445
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:01,453
Well, Iet's tear it apart.

446
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:04,962
Start by getting a warrant
for the cell phone company.

447
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:14,402
Hey.

448
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:19,974
You know, everybody
in that room is on your side.

449
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:22,478
But we're not mind-readers,

450
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:25,209
and if you're not going to say
what's going on with you,
that's fine,

451
00:22:25,283 --> 00:22:28,548
but there's not a whole
hell of a Iot we can do.

452
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:35,251
I know you're on my side.
EIIiot, what is going on?

453
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:37,754
Would you talk to me?

454
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:41,265
Is there somebody else?
No, it's nothing Iike that.

455
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:46,460
To be honest, it'd be easier
if there was. I...

456
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:49,203
I don't know what this is.

457
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:53,635
It's... It just never
goes away, you know.

458
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:56,445
Every case, a Iittle bit
more horrific than the Iast.

459
00:22:58,517 --> 00:22:59,950
And I go home.

460
00:23:01,186 --> 00:23:03,381
What am I supposed to do,
talk about my day at work?

461
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:07,687
"Honey, today a guy cut a baby
out of his wife's stomach.
Pass the gravy, please."

462
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,024
So you just don't talk at all.

463
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:13,556
That's no solution, EIIiot.

464
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:20,270
Well, one of us has to be able
to sleep at night.

465
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:22,671
She thinks I'm shutting
her out.

466
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,944
You are.
That's exactly what you do.

467
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:36,747
You keep this up,
you're going to ruin
the best thing you ever had.

468
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:47,196
The phone wasn't GPS assisted,
so we can't give you
a precise Iocation.

469
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:49,928
But the call detail record
will tell us which cell site
he used.

470
00:23:50,002 --> 00:23:51,230
How close will it get us?

471
00:23:51,303 --> 00:23:52,770
With all the wireless
companies operating

472
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:56,797
there are anywhere from
400 to 600 cell sites
all over the city.

473
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,570
Depending on the angle

474
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:02,011
and the time-distance arrival
of the radio frequency,

475
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,378
sometimes we can narrow
it down to a couple of blocks.

476
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:08,575
This is it. Cell site 24.

477
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:12,647
Lincoln Center. Not far from
where Nicole was attacked.

478
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:15,625
Manning said he made the calls
from the restaurant
in the Upper East Side.

479
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:17,628
So what's he doing
on the other side of town?

480
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,020
Changing his clothes
most Iikely.

481
00:24:20,098 --> 00:24:22,123
Manning belongs to a gym
near Lincoln Center.

482
00:24:22,201 --> 00:24:23,225
Signed in at 8:00.

483
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:25,668
What, he just walked in
wearing bloody clothing?

484
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:27,034
CIeaned up most of it
at the scene.

485
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:29,471
The dump site where they found
the baby was on the way.

486
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:33,341
Gym receptionist said that
he was wearing a Iong coat
and carrying a duffel bag.

487
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:35,778
Probably made the calls
to establish he was
Iooking for Nicole,

488
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:37,941
showered, and went home.
What'd we find at the gym?

489
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:40,314
Unfortunately, nothing there
Iinks to the crime scene.

490
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,615
The dumpster was empty,
no regular Iocker,

491
00:24:42,688 --> 00:24:46,180
and CSU won't even bother
checking the drain traps
on public showers.

492
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,247
Can't blame them.

493
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:48,725
We canvassing
the cab companies?

494
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:50,421
He had Iess than half an hour
to get home.

495
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:53,192
No.
I don't think he took a cab.

496
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:55,433
He's been fairly meticulous
so far.

497
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:56,900
That would be one more witness
he didn't need.

498
00:24:56,969 --> 00:24:57,993
Could he have run?

499
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,595
We clocked it.
Manning had plenty of time.

500
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,071
You both ran it?

501
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,472
Walked it, and we still had
a couple of minutes to spare.

502
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:06,841
He's got a motive.
He Iied about his alibi.

503
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:09,904
The gym bag could be
at his house. He had to carry
that baby in something.

504
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:11,643
AIong with the murder weapon
and blood evidence.

505
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,412
I'II call Cabot for a warrant.

506
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:16,283
Doc, I want you in
on this search.
You know how shrinks operate.

507
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:18,619
Time to give up
your trade secrets.
Okay.

508
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,622
What've you got?
Well, there's no gym bag.

509
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:30,429
And aside from these
manicure scissors,
there's no cutting instrument.

510
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:34,461
But this guy is
a piece of work.
You gotta check this out.

511
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,441
His Iaundry is nicer
than my entire wardrobe.

512
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:41,001
Folds and Iabels them.
Whites, colors, dry cleaning.

513
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:43,172
Anything marked
"bloody clothes"?

514
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:47,381
He's got enough
personal hygiene products
in here to open his own salon.

515
00:25:47,452 --> 00:25:48,476
AII his.

516
00:25:48,554 --> 00:25:51,352
So do I, but that doesn't
make me a murderer.

517
00:25:51,423 --> 00:25:53,789
Everything about him
is all about appearances.

518
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,656
Working out,
this gym equipment.

519
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:58,821
For some reason,
he has feelings
of being unattractive,

520
00:25:58,897 --> 00:25:59,886
unmanly.

521
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:01,990
His advantage is that
he's extremely intelligent

522
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:04,126
as evidenced
by his careful planning.

523
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:07,501
Ironically, he's probably
a pretty gifted psychiatrist.

524
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:10,667
I especially admire
his gift for killing babies.

525
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:14,041
It's a symptom
of the same problem.
He's preoccupied with order.

526
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:17,206
He thinks
that if he can control
every detail of his Iife,

527
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:20,115
then he can become this man
that he wants to be.

528
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:23,643
His wife wasn't so easy
to control. Look at this mess.

529
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:26,282
Well, when she threatened
to destroy the order
that he created

530
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:28,690
then he went to extremes
to get it back.

531
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:31,520
What's it Iook Iike?

532
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:34,464
We're taking every knife
from the kitchen
back to the Iab,

533
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,296
but I'm not hoping for much.

534
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:38,632
I doubt he brought anything
from the crime scene
back here.

535
00:26:38,704 --> 00:26:40,968
What the hell is this?

536
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,633
It's a search, Dr. Manning.
We'II be out of your way
in a minute.

537
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,734
You can't march in here
and destroy my home.

538
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:50,145
Yeah, it's a real bite in the
ass, isn't it? AII those new
Iabels you'II have to make...

539
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,042
Those your only set of keys?

540
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:53,379
Yeah.

541
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:54,476
Tough.

542
00:26:54,553 --> 00:26:55,577
I need those.

543
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:57,154
Ramone.
Yeah?

544
00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:59,588
Luminol these for me,
will you?

545
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:05,253
VARGAS: See, the problem
with blood is,
it gets absorbed by plastic.

546
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,820
Can't wash it off.

547
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,798
What is that supposed to be?

548
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:11,165
Exactly
what we're Iooking for.

549
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:18,506
You remember Dr. George Huang
from our search today?

550
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:22,978
He's a psychiatrist, too.
This is Dr. Richard Manning.

551
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:25,539
They brought you in
to shrink the shrink, huh?

552
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:27,551
Does that make you feel
important?

553
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:30,884
It just seems unnecessary.
I didn't do anything wrong.

554
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:33,083
Your wife did though, right?
No.

555
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:37,151
We were having
marital problems, and we were
working on solving them.

556
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:38,287
She Ieft you.

557
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,024
I wouldn't say
she was Ieaving me

558
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:42,726
so much as going to the man
who fathered her child.

559
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:45,929
She just thought
that was the best solution
to her problem.

560
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:49,337
HUANG:
But it was the wrong solution.

561
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:53,743
And now her problem
doesn't exist because
there is no child.

562
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,471
Well, yes.
BENSON:
Well, actually, Dr. Manning,

563
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:00,083
Nicole wasn't going to marry
Kyle Novacek.

564
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:01,983
AII she wanted
was to get away from you.

565
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:03,851
Nicole doesn't know
what she wants.

566
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:07,187
Apparently she wanted
to have a relationship
with another man. Why?

567
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:09,784
She probably felt
our relationship was Iacking.

568
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:12,489
Lacking is a real
interesting word.

569
00:28:13,298 --> 00:28:15,823
What is it you were Iacking,
Dick?

570
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:18,769
Challenging my masculinity.

571
00:28:18,837 --> 00:28:21,465
A Iittle amateurish,
don't you think?
HUANG: No.

572
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,874
I think he's challenging
your masculinity because it's
a pretty obvious weakness.

573
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:27,707
You're a smart guy.

574
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,740
Your problem is
you think you're smarter
than everyone else.

575
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:32,215
That's why you screw up.

576
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:34,149
You been to the gym Iately?

577
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:38,752
Yes. I forgot to mention that.
I did go to the gym
that night.

578
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:42,021
I was very worried
about Nicole, so I Ieft.

579
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:47,088
Oh, well, there you go,
mystery solved. See, that's
why you're such a genius.

580
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:51,893
Can't fool you,
not for a second. So, genius,
what I want to know is

581
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,097
how in the hell Nicole
fooled you into believing

582
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:55,163
you were the father
of her child.

583
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:58,472
Your wife made you Iook
stupid, and you
made her pay for it.

584
00:28:58,544 --> 00:28:59,670
I Iove my wife.

585
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:00,974
You almost killed her.

586
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:02,947
No, he killed the baby.

587
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:06,109
He just wasn't smart enough
to do the job right.

588
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:08,010
I don't even know
what that means.

589
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:12,148
Nicole will never have
children again, Dr. Manning,
and neither will you.

590
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:13,749
STABLER:
You screwed up, smart guy.

591
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:15,418
You couldn't be
more wrong about me.

592
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:18,123
AII I care about is
my wife and my family.

593
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:19,391
It ruined everything.

594
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:20,830
Your wife's child.

595
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,432
Yeah.
And so you got rid of it.

596
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:25,261
Wouldn't anyone?

597
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,138
Arrest him.

598
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:38,706
We've got him
for attempted murder
and assault one

599
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:40,946
for the attack on the mother,
plus abortion one.

600
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,387
And murder.
He killed that baby.

601
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,990
Warner's certain of that?

602
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,119
Baby was alive, now it's dead.
What's the problem?

603
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:51,788
The problem is whether or not
we can establish

604
00:29:51,864 --> 00:29:54,196
the baby was Iegally a person.

605
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:56,132
But how do we do that?

606
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:59,171
Prove the baby was born alive
according to
New York State Law.

607
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:02,036
Something that indicates
it took a breath, moved.

608
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:04,042
If it died while it was
still in its mother's womb,

609
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,544
it technically wasn't
a person, so it's not murder.

610
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:09,775
If that baby
had been born in a hospital,
it would've Iived.

611
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:10,975
Doesn't matter.

612
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,382
Neo-natacides are notoriously
difficult to prosecute

613
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:16,683
because the medical evidence
is almost always inconclusive.

614
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:19,657
Without a witness
stating unequivocally
the baby was a Iive birth,

615
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:22,193
I'm just not certain we'd get
a murder conviction through.

616
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:25,094
Best we can do is illegal
third-trimester abortion.

617
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:27,928
That's a D-felony.
We'II get more out of
the assault charge.

618
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,528
At seven months, a baby
moves inside of the mother.

619
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:36,400
The only reason that baby
is dead is because
he bashed its skull in.

620
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:39,603
Now, I don't care if you
call it a person or not,
that's murder.

621
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,080
That argument
could also be used
to condemn Iegal abortion.

622
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:46,050
Do you want me to charge
every doctor who performs
an abortion with murder?

623
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:48,609
Abortion is different.
It's the mother's choice.

624
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:50,781
We're not talking about
the mother's rights.

625
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:53,087
You want to charge
for homicide
with the fetus as victim,

626
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,753
you give the fetus rights.
Do you want to go
down that road?

627
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:56,886
It's not the same thing.

628
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:58,328
In the eyes of the Iaw, it is.

629
00:30:58,397 --> 00:30:59,489
Well, the Iaw needs to change.

630
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,090
BENSON: I don't know, EIIiot.
You can't have it both ways.

631
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:03,999
A fetus is either a Iife
or it's not.

632
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,560
You saw that baby.

633
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:07,162
OIivia, you saw that baby.

634
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,573
This guy's gonna walk.
And I don't Iike it
any more than you do,

635
00:31:10,643 --> 00:31:13,077
but this is
very dangerous territory.

636
00:31:13,145 --> 00:31:16,546
And I am not prepared to
dismantle reproductive rights
on an inconclusive case.

637
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:20,347
We're going to Iet
a murderer get away
to preserve a political ideal.

638
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:22,683
I don't even know
what I'm doing here!

639
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:24,846
Take a break, Detective.

640
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:32,590
Your ME comes back with
solid medical evidence

641
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:35,065
the baby was born alive,
we've got something
to work with.

642
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:39,127
But I will not charge
for murder on the death
of an unborn child.

643
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:42,867
You and your partner park
yourself in Warner's office

644
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,773
until she hands
over that autopsy.

645
00:31:44,844 --> 00:31:47,608
AIex, unless you've got other
plans, I want you there, too.

646
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,581
Why?
You need solid
medical evidence?

647
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,675
Make sure Warner's got it.

648
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,855
WARNER: Presence of gas
in the stomach,
contracted umbilical cord,

649
00:31:57,924 --> 00:32:00,518
subpleural
and subepicardial petechiae,

650
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:05,292
partially expanded pulmonary
alveoli, fully-aerated,
crepitant, salmon-pink Iungs.

651
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:06,422
In English?

652
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:09,525
He took a breath.
Probably more than one.

653
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:10,967
So, he was a Iive birth?

654
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:12,629
That's what I'm saying
in my report.

655
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:15,265
To be clear, if I'm going
to charge Richard Manning

656
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,775
with the murder of the baby,
that means
I drop the abortion charge

657
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:19,868
and the attempted
murder charge of Nicole.

658
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:21,277
We can only have one theory
of the crime.

659
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:23,315
Either he was trying to kill
his wife or his child.

660
00:32:23,382 --> 00:32:26,510
Meaning we better be
damn sure,
he only goes down for assault.

661
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:30,180
Neonates decompose at
a faster rate, so there's
an inevitable margin of error.

662
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:32,087
Which doesn't
do us any favors.

663
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,355
You need to be willing
to testify to a reasonable
degree of medical certainty

664
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:38,329
this was a Iive birth.
I am.

665
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:43,265
I'II supersede
the indictments.

666
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:51,007
I also performed
a hydrostatic test
on the Iungs

667
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:53,511
in order to determine
if they had been inflated.

668
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:56,037
Dr. Warner,
you are Iooking at a guy
who failed biology twice.

669
00:32:56,116 --> 00:33:00,052
I'm a science idiot.
What is a hydrostatic test?

670
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:03,554
The Iungs are placed in water.
If a significant portion
of the Iungs float,

671
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:06,558
it means
they had been inflated,
as was the case here.

672
00:33:06,626 --> 00:33:10,790
So this means the fetus
took a breath?
Yes.

673
00:33:11,465 --> 00:33:14,400
Dr. Warner, will you define

674
00:33:15,736 --> 00:33:18,364
postmortem putrefaction
for me?

675
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:22,238
It describes the series
of changes that occur
to tissue after death.

676
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:24,402
Those changes include
the formation of gases,

677
00:33:24,478 --> 00:33:28,881
such as mercaptans
and hydrogen sulfide, right?

678
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,082
Yes.
Let me ask this.

679
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,278
After your initial
hydrostatic test,

680
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:38,791
did you deflate the Iungs,
re-inflate them,
and then repeat the test

681
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:42,488
to expel any gasses
that may have been present
due to decomposition?

682
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,725
Performing the test twice
is often misleading.

683
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,632
So you probably
didn't do it, then.
Objection.

684
00:33:48,702 --> 00:33:51,034
I'm sure there are plenty
of tests the doctor
did not perform,

685
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,401
none of which are relevant.

686
00:33:52,472 --> 00:33:55,532
Overruled. The witness
may answer the question.

687
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,937
I did not perform
the test a second time.

688
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:00,843
LANGAN: Okay. You were
probably busy that day,

689
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,938
that's understandable...
Your Honor...

690
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:04,108
Let's keep up the pace,
Mr. Langan.

691
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:07,146
Is it possible
the expansion of the Iungs

692
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,451
could be attributed
to post-mortem putrefaction?

693
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:13,020
It is possible, but there
were other factors...

694
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,754
Assume you're right, though,

695
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:17,023
and the fetus took a breath.

696
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:23,692
Dr. Warner, tell me,
for a baby to be
considered born,

697
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:28,301
it has to be completely
expelled from the uterus,
am I right?

698
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,835
Yes.

699
00:34:31,912 --> 00:34:36,076
Is it possible
a fetus can take a breath

700
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,776
while partially expelled

701
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:41,586
but die before
it is fully expelled?

702
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:45,554
Yes, it is possible.

703
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:50,590
Is there any way to determine
when the breath was taken,

704
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:53,258
assuming it was taken
to begin with?

705
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:58,599
Short of eyewitness
testimony, no.

706
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:01,272
LANGAN: But we
don't have that.

707
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:06,603
Thank you, Dr. Warner.
You've been very patient
with my ignorance.

708
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,748
Tell me that Iooked worse
than it actually was.

709
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,754
If you think it Iooks Iike
we just Iost our murder
conviction, you're right.

710
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,346
Warner said exactly
what you wanted her to say,

711
00:35:17,424 --> 00:35:20,154
and you Iet
Manning's Iawyer sandbag her.
Why didn't you stop him?

712
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:22,388
Because he's right, Detective.

713
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,293
We can't prove how and when
that baby died

714
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:25,388
beyond a reasonable doubt,

715
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:27,831
and if you want to blame me
for that, go right ahead.

716
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:29,630
So we got nothing?

717
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:32,799
Barring an outright confession
the child was alive,

718
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:35,899
he gets three-and-half to nine
for the assault, out in two.

719
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:39,878
Unless he gets off entirely
on extreme emotional distress.

720
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:43,646
I wish I could do more,
EIIiot.

721
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,255
Detective, what a surprise.

722
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:57,228
Don't say anything.

723
00:35:58,598 --> 00:36:01,431
PIease,
start harassing my client.
I'd Iove a mistrial.

724
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:04,561
Trevor, Ieave us alone
for a bit, please.

725
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,570
I'm going to waste my breath
and strongly advise
against it.

726
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:12,670
Anything you say
is going right to the DA.

727
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:14,577
Just a few minutes.

728
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,557
Usually my time is worth
$200 an hour.

729
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:31,228
Not worth much now, is it?

730
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:32,697
It's a matter of opinion.

731
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,832
You must be pretty proud
of yourself.

732
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:44,106
Getting everybody
to buy your story.

733
00:36:44,177 --> 00:36:45,337
It's the truth.

734
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:51,743
Tell me again how it happened,
how you murdered that baby.

735
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:56,716
You don't actually think
you're going to get me
to confess something, do you?

736
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:01,217
But that's not why
you're really here, is it?

737
00:37:01,895 --> 00:37:03,988
You're gonna shrink me now?

738
00:37:05,465 --> 00:37:07,023
You want me to?

739
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,673
You're married.
Eighteen years.

740
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,473
Children as well?

741
00:37:21,548 --> 00:37:22,742
Four of them.

742
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:28,779
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your family?

743
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:38,428
Killing a child? No, I don't
see myself doing that.

744
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,459
Maybe not, but you know
what your problem is?

745
00:37:43,703 --> 00:37:46,729
You understand that impulse.

746
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,071
You know exactly
why I did what I had to do.

747
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,337
Protect what you have
by destroying it?

748
00:37:55,415 --> 00:37:57,542
No. I didn't destroy anything.

749
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:06,218
Think about it.

750
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:07,954
I didn't destroy anything.

751
00:38:19,406 --> 00:38:24,207
Nicole and I agreed to meet
to try to salvage
our marriage.

752
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:28,310
I was waiting
at the restaurant,
and all I could think was,

753
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:30,372
"She's with him.

754
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,613
"She's with him, right now,
and they're Iaughing at me."

755
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:37,350
Not very rational thoughts.
Objection.

756
00:38:37,424 --> 00:38:39,654
Put a question mark
on it Mr. Langan.

757
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:42,820
In your estimation,
as a psychiatrist,

758
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:45,397
were your thoughts
those of a rational person?

759
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:46,693
No.

760
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,634
I could only describe it
as a textbook,
total break with reality.

761
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:54,569
And then suddenly
I was running across the park,
finding her,

762
00:38:54,642 --> 00:38:59,477
and acting solely
on these powerful emotions
that I could not control.

763
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:02,015
Can you characterize
your state of mind
during that time?

764
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:05,348
It was as if I was possessed

765
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:08,216
or being controlled
by someone else.

766
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:12,555
I Iook back now,
and I can't believe

767
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:14,150
what I've done
to the woman I Iove.

768
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:18,824
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

769
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:22,933
No further questions.

770
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:26,068
People are entering
into evidence
the People's Four.

771
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,505
Defense has no knowledge
of this evidence...

772
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:28,599
Which my detectives

773
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:32,544
only just brought to me.
Knock it off.
Bring that over here.

774
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:48,451
This evidence was not
made available in discovery.
It can't be presented.

775
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:50,929
This is an extraneous matter
not material to the charge.

776
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:53,728
The People had no duty
to tender it upon discovery.

777
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:57,567
I'm Ietting it in,
assuming Miss Cabot
convinces me it's relevant.

778
00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:59,299
Request a recess
to confer with my client.

779
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:01,034
So, what,
you can advise him to Iie?

780
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:04,475
He's on the stand,
and he's staying there.
Step back.

781
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:11,116
Dr. Manning,
you testified that you snapped

782
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:14,279
because your wife told you
she was having an affair

783
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:16,823
and that her unborn child
was fathered by another man,

784
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:19,416
causing you to attack her

785
00:40:19,493 --> 00:40:22,121
and cut the child from
her body. Is that correct?

786
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:23,629
Yes.

787
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:26,757
How did you know
she was telling you the truth?

788
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:29,869
Why would she Iie about that?

789
00:40:29,937 --> 00:40:32,963
Were you unable to have
children, Dr. Manning?

790
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,773
I'm capable
of having children.

791
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:42,071
And were you having sexual
relations with your wife seven
months prior to her attack?

792
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,610
Yes.

793
00:40:43,684 --> 00:40:46,278
But you took her word for it
that she was having an affair?

794
00:40:46,353 --> 00:40:49,049
I knew about that
before she told me.

795
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,347
For how Iong?

796
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:53,351
From the beginning?

797
00:40:53,427 --> 00:40:54,655
CIose to it.

798
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:57,663
Then it's fair to say
you would know,

799
00:40:57,731 --> 00:41:01,064
probably, if your wife
was having an affair
with yet another man.

800
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:03,069
Objection.
That is totally irrelevant.

801
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:04,798
I think we both know it's not,
Your Honor.

802
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:08,774
Speak for yourself,
Miss Cabot. Prove relevance
quickly or move on.

803
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:12,939
Is it all possible your wife
was having an affair
that you didn't know about?

804
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,004
No, absolutely not.

805
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:16,379
How do you know this?

806
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:19,851
I am aware of what goes on
in my own house.

807
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:23,885
So the only two people who
could have possibly fathered
Nicole Manning's child

808
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:26,392
were yourself
and Kyle Novacek?

809
00:41:26,794 --> 00:41:28,762
She told me it was him.

810
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:31,424
People's Four.

811
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:35,060
This is the paternity test
against Nicole Manning's
child and Kyle Novacek,

812
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:38,502
proving that, in fact,
Mr. Novacek is not the father.

813
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:39,830
LANGAN: Objection.

814
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:42,569
CABOT: So the Iogical
deduction is that
you were the father

815
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:44,076
of your wife's child,
Dr. Manning.

816
00:41:44,144 --> 00:41:46,374
LANGAN: Whether he was right
or not about the paternity
of the fetus

817
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:47,914
has no bearing
on his state of mind.

818
00:41:47,982 --> 00:41:49,677
PRESTON: Overruled.

819
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:52,745
Isn't it probable,
Dr. Manning,

820
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,880
that you were the father
of your wife's child?

821
00:42:01,362 --> 00:42:04,024
I would've known.
How?

822
00:42:09,503 --> 00:42:11,630
How could you have known?

823
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:16,272
You were so sure he couldn't
have been your child.

824
00:42:19,046 --> 00:42:21,276
But he had to be, Dr. Manning.

825
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:27,048
There's no other explanation,
is there?
I don't know.

826
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,956
You held your own child
in your hands,

827
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:35,962
your own Iiving child.

828
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:46,332
Did he cry?

829
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:51,473
Did your son cry
before you killed him?

830
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:01,386
He only cried a Iittle.

831
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:04,757
He only cried a Iittle.
