NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,898
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:05,065
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:07,871
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:11,710
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,544
These are their stories,

00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:18,116
SIoop on the end
is nice, huh?

8
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:20,587
It's not a sloop,
it's a ketch.

9
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:23,318
No, it's a sloop.
I've been pricing them.

10
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:26,954
Union win some
monumental hike in rookie pay
I didn't hear about?

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,362
Hey, never too soon
to plan for retirement.

12
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:30,524
Retirement?

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,091
What makes you think you pass
the six-month review?

Sir, everything
all right?

17
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:45,040
I need to see
your marina pass.

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,177
We got a runner.

19
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:50,378
Oh! Hey!
Stop!

20
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:52,216
Police!
20, Frank to Central.

21
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:56,520
Pick up on a suspicious male
fleeing on foot
inside Riverside Park.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,619
Hey, get back here!
Stop!

23
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:08,401
Oh, damn it.

24
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:12,100
On the ground!
Face down, hands
on the back of your head.

25
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:13,802
Hey, Josh, can you
help me here?
I got him.

26
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:15,639
Yeah. I got something
over here, too.

27
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:22,776
We got IDs?
No wallet on the guy.

28
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:25,218
Woman was stripped naked,
no sign of her clothes.

29
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:28,689
They were sexually positioned
after death.
This rock our weapon?

30
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:31,522
We don't know
where that fits in.
We're Iooking for a knife.

31
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:33,061
BIitz attack
or they put up a fight?

32
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,428
Defensive wounds on the guy.
The woman, we can't say.

33
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:38,160
Hands are missing.

34
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:41,361
So is the head.

35
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:43,200
We're searching
the area, ma'am.

(SIREN WAILING)
Officer Dorsey.

37
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:47,866
Like I was telling
your partner, our collar
might Iook good for it.

38
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:49,138
Tossed a bag in the water.

39
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,873
Big enough to hold
the missing parts.

40
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:52,744
My partner's got him
in our car.

41
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:55,375
He talking?
We called in
for an interpreter.

42
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:58,579
I speak a Iittle Spanish
and French. I can Mirandize
in three others.

43
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:00,588
What is he?
Deaf.

44
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:51,540
You have the right
to an attorney.

45
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:54,440
You have the right to have
an attorney present
during questioning.

46
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,841
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

47
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:58,881
one will be provided for you
free of charge.

48
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:00,813
It's also on this card.

BENSON: Do you understand
your rights, Scotty?

50
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,846
I'm deaf, not dumb.

51
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,023
I don't need a Iawyer.
I didn't do anything.

52
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:13,888
Well, good.
What were you doing
on the docks?

53
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,867
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk.

54
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,303
You always run from police
when you go on your walks?

55
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:28,273
AII I saw was the Iight
they blinded me with.
I was scared, so I ran.

56
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:31,404
So fast that you dropped
your bag in the river.

57
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:37,209
It was weighing me down.
Well, body parts
can get heavy.

58
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,982
So what happened here?

59
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:51,857
I had nothing to do
with this. I don't know
what you're trying to pull.

60
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,801
I am not involved
with this.

61
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,838
So what was in your bag?

62
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:00,564
(EXHALES)

63
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:05,178
We recovered
the duffel bag downstream.
With the head and hands?

64
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,910
Stolen goods.
Two high-end Iaptops
and some jewelry.

65
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:09,679
From?
A burgled houseboat.

66
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:11,242
Right about where
they first spotted Scotty.

67
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,049
PIenty of prints.
We're running them now.

68
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:16,114
Boat by any chance
missing its owners?
Both alive and pissed.

69
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:19,753
They didn't take out
extended warranties
on the computers.

How's it going?
(CLEARS THROAT)
It's not adding up.

72
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:30,101
There's no way
he came out of that bloodbath
without a drop on him.

73
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:31,366
What's on his rap sheet?

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,001
Larceny, marijuana possession.
No assaults.

75
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:39,479
What do you want to do?
Hand him off to burglary.

76
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:42,984
But Iet's check around
the deaf community, see if
he's missing any enemies.

77
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,644
Or a girlfriend.

78
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:48,886
Where are we
with missing persons?

79
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,550
Having trouble
filling in the blanks

80
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:53,561
Iike height, hair color,
eye color.

81
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,462
That was probably the point.
No fingerprints
or dental records.

82
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:59,660
Why hers, not his?
Perp's connection
was to her.

83
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:01,464
Maybe he has
a sexual fetishism.

84
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:04,097
Kemper had a whole closet
full of heads.
No hands.

85
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:07,700
Cannibalism?
No, you'd go
for the fleshier parts.

86
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:10,211
AII right, all right.
Enough theories,
I want facts.

87
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,409
The more we know
about the victims,
the clearer motive becomes.

88
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:18,145
Male was in his mid 50s.
Female in her early 40s.

89
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,552
Aside from her obvious
head and hand wounds,

90
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:23,990
both suffered deep,
jagged stab wounds
to the midsection.

91
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,084
What kind of knife
we talking?

92
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:28,062
KARLAN: Major-duty hunting
with a sharp,
8-inch serrated blade.

93
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,724
Got a nasty head Iaceration.
We got a bloody rock.

94
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,236
No. I found
embedded tree bark.

95
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,804
Might have been hit
with a hefty branch.

96
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:38,840
Results in from
the rape kit?
Spermicide.

97
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:42,071
But his pants were open,
had Iipstick on him.

98
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:45,136
So she was doing
the male victim,
perp happened upon them,

99
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:48,741
killed him, took his place,
killed her when he was done.

100
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,753
He's got a wedding ring.
This a married couple?

101
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:55,013
Trust me, married couples
don't have sex in parks.

102
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:56,524
Maybe he picked up a pro.

103
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:58,719
I don't find
too many working girls
who make it to 40

104
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:00,887
without any evidence
of cervical dysplasia.

105
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:02,988
Mistress?
They didn't party together.

106
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,898
John Doe here had
a blood alcohol Ievel of.17.

107
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:10,029
She didn't have a trace.
Opposites attract.
Any hit on his prints?

108
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,130
No.

109
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:16,273
But pacemaker companies
are required to keep records
on all patients.

110
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,473
As much as I'd Iike
to help out,

111
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,145
Celadyne Industries puts
great stock in our customers'
right to privacy.

112
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:27,916
And yet you spend
so much Iess on R and D
than your competitors.

113
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,582
FDA had a Iittle problem
with that, didn't they?

114
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,785
That was a voluntary recall.

115
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:36,196
Celadyne's L wires
had a tendency to fracture
mid-pulse,

116
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:39,530
piercing recipients
through the heart.
That's just wrong.

117
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:41,661
We have since made
significant design
improvements

118
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:46,333
to our dual-chamber
pulse generators,
but we can only do so much.

119
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:50,436
We can't make people
take their meds or refrain
from risky behaviors.

120
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:52,538
MUNCH: Our guy
got himself stabbed.

121
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:55,448
That's hardly
a product malfunction.

122
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:59,750
Can't rule it out
as a contributing factor
without a special inquiry.

Mrs. Boggs,
when was the Iast time
you saw your husband?

127
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,704
When he was
Ieaving for work.

128
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:22,733
What time was that?
4:00. He works
the night shift.

129
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:28,350
Do you know why he would have
been in Riverside Park
between 7:00 and 10:00?

130
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,978
No. That doesn't
make sense. No.

131
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:35,990
He worked
at the reclamation plant
on Randall's Island.

132
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:39,425
We're still trying
to piece together
all the details.

133
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:43,526
He did, however,
have a high Ievel of alcohol
in his blood.

134
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:47,559
That's impossible.
Edward doesn't drink anymore.

135
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,304
Mrs. Boggs, was your husband
having an affair?

00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:57,644

No. Why would you ask that?

was also found in the park.

She's good.
She's in shock.

in the act, see ya.

with one of the regulars.

151
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:42,988
You know her name?
His. Vinnie. Scum.

152
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:46,919
What'd they talk about?
Women.

153
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:50,762
Vinnie was all,
"Bitches this, bitches that,"
every time I walk by.

154
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,929
They Ieave together?
After the game, about 9:00.

155
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:58,064
Anything else?
I got ice cubes melting.

156
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,866
Trouble at home,
stress at the job.

157
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:05,175
Ed goes out to the bars
to unwind and rag
on the old Iady.

158
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:09,445
Enter Vinnie.
They start pounding them back,
stories get heated.

159
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,884
We've been Iooking at Ed
as only a victim.

160
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:15,151
Maybe he and Vinnie run into
the woman on the street
and wolf-pack her.

161
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:19,752
Ed's down for the rape
but not the murder. He freaks,
Vinnie takes him out.

162
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,421
Hey, you got
a Vinnie up there.
Is that our guy?

163
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,261
Yeah, chronic Ioser.

164
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,934
Does he play
the weekly pool, too?

165
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:30,494
Never picks more than
three winners a week.

166
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:34,942
My Iabrador does better
than that.
Today's his Iucky day.

167
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,274
You know, this is entrapment.
I'm a victim
of a sting operation.

168
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:42,715
I'm here under...
False pretenses?

169
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:43,979
False arrest.

170
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,850
Hey, man, you're not even
under arrest, yet,

171
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:48,481
so why don't you just
settle down and tell us
about your friend Ed?

172
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:51,993
Hey, screw you.
I can screw you harder.

173
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:55,053
See, we have this handy Iittle
Iaw enforcement
tool that allows us

174
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,963
to throw
suspicious people Iike you
in jail for 24 hours.

175
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,660
So why don't we
try this again?

176
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:02,966
Look, I got this job.
I can't mess up, all right?

177
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,972
They're gonna fire me
if I don't show.

178
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,837
So tell us about
your night with Ed.

179
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,900
We had a conversation.
Is that a crime?

180
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:11,970
BENSON: It depends.
What did you two talk about?

181
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:13,309
Bitches.

182
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:17,580
Guy had this female boss.
Real ball-buster, you know?

183
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:22,056
And about two weeks ago,
fires his ass
for no reason whatsoever.

184
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:23,421
That must have pissed him off.

185
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,722
He was crying in his whiskey
when I found him.

186
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,558
So you join him
and you stoke up
the fires there?

187
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,725
I spent the better part
of the night reinflating
the guy's gonads.

188
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,858
Now he wants revenge,

189
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:36,268
so you two start
talking about bitches
to take it out on.

190
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:39,330
He didn't even have the stones
to go home and tell
his old Iady he'd been fired.

191
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:41,569
Pretended to go to work
every day.

192
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:43,839
That's why he was Ioading up
on Iiquid courage,

193
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:46,972
to go home and confess.
But you had a different plan.

194
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:50,212
Yeah, another bar.
You know, pick up some broads.

195
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,945
But he turned me down flat,
so we parted company.

196
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,253
Now, where would this
have been?
Riverside.

197
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,655
Where I caught a taxi.

198
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:02,663
Which way did Ed go?
Ed went into the park.
Nature called.

199
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:11,539
Female victim
was attacked here,

200
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:14,269
dragged over to this spot
where she's butchered.

201
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:17,312
She's then sexually positioned
with the male victim

202
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,007
who bled out right here.
One perp, two victims.

203
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,549
FIN: Look at this.

204
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:26,444
Now, I'm no park ranger,
but since when did trees
bleed red sap?

205
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:29,119
ME found bark
in Ed's forehead.

206
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:31,216
Footprints are pointing
toward the tree.

207
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:35,753
Run a urine analysis
on that bark. I bet you'd find
Ed's DNA about waist high.

208
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:37,992
Vinnie said
that nature called.

209
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,592
So he had
no connection whatsoever
to the female victim?

210
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,296
Okay, new theory.

211
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:46,764
Perp rapes her,
starts dismemberment.
He hears a twig snap.

212
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:48,173
Sneaks up behind Ed,

213
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:51,508
smashes his head
into the trunk right there.
No witness.

214
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:54,605
Explains why his pants
were open.
Wait a minute.

215
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:58,619
The ME said he found
the female victim's Iipstick
on Boggs.

216
00:11:58,687 --> 00:11:59,984
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Perp's screwing with us.

217
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:03,456
He staged that relationship
to throw us off track.

218
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,959
Benson.

219
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:07,461
Yeah, right.

220
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:11,794
Sewer worker in Brooklyn
just found the remains
of a hand.

221
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,970
You mind slipping this on?

222
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:28,244
Why?
I need it to hold form.

223
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:32,378
Thumbs have to be
similar in size, or we'II get
distorted results.

224
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,186
Too manly.

225
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,258
TREVOR: It's been through hell
and back. Submerged
for at Ieast 20 hours,

226
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,128
after which rats made
a picnic out of it.

227
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,466
I'II run her through
the system.

228
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:50,494
Let's just hope
she's an ex-con, teacher
or otherwise bonded.

229
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,976
I passed the poly.

230
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:03,648
Get him out of here.
What, no apology?

231
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,485
We got a hit
on the thumbprint.

232
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,013
Who?

233
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:10,989
Special Agent Pam Tilden.

234
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,027
FBI?
MFPCA.

235
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,529
Manhattan's Humane
Law Enforcement.
STABLER: The dog police.

236
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:18,760
Yeah, she investigated people
who tortured
and abused animals.

237
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:23,430
Future wife beaters,
child abusers.
And serial killers.

238
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:29,167
(DOG BARKING)
OKEL: You think Pam
knew her killer?

239
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:31,405
Lengths taken
to hide her identity,
it's a good bet.

240
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,641
Was she having any trouble
in her personal Iife?

241
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,876
Not that I know of.
Boyfriend?

242
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,146
Pam was married to the job.

243
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:40,519
Here she is.

244
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:43,319
She was with us seven years.
BENSON: She worked out
in the field?

245
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:46,054
There are five million animals
in this city
and just fourteen of us.

246
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:47,390
We all work the field.

She work on any case recently
that might have
put her at risk?

248
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:53,294
We don't carry firearms
for the fashion statement.

249
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:55,734
You never know
what's on the other side
of the door.

250
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:58,466
We're gonna need a copy
of those case files.

251
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:57,770
Well, who do we sweat first,
granny with 65 cats

252
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:01,676
or the SoHo poodle poisoner?
Well, here's the Iast case
she closed.

253
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:04,738
This guy Jake moves into
his father's basement
with his new bride, Missy.

254
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:06,977
Father walks in on them
on their wedding night.

255
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:10,283
How is that animal cruelty?
Missy's a German shepherd.

256
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:12,619
That's perfectly Iegal
in 26 states.

257
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:15,319
Jake argued it wasn't
bestiality, where the animal
is often hurt,

258
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:18,123
but zoophilia,
which is a Ioving,
Iife commitment.

259
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:19,788
Unfortunately,
we're not Iooking
for zoo couples.

Well, that goes
in the good pile.

267

most violent perps.

You know how they train
those dogs to fight?

271
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:47,517
They starve them, beat them,

272
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:50,152
and then they collect strays
to use as sparring partners.

273

Come fight night,
big money changes hands

comes out alive.

Ten pit bulls.
Brought in gang intel
to shut down the operation.

Was there payback?

They broke in here,
graffitied the place
with gang symbols.

Why didn't you
mention that before?

280

(DOG BARKING)
It was an isolated incident
months ago.

to spend her downtime in here.

there was a hurt animal
in there.

00:15:58,263 --> 00:16:00,993
Wanted to see
what she would do.
How old the kid?

298
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,899
OId enough to know better.
Fifteen, sixteen, maybe.

299
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:05,869
And he threatened
Agent Tilden?

300
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:09,634
Said whenever
she ran into him upstairs,
he'd cuss her out.

301
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:11,999
(PHONE RINGING)
What was he doing here?

302
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:14,136
That's the court's
big punishment.

303
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:17,511
Ten sessions on the couch
with our company shrink.

304
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:18,674
(DOGS BARKING)
Yeah.

305
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:24,049
DOCTOR: It's a pilot program.

306
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:26,647
Court-mandated counseling
for animal abusers.

307
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:28,590
STABLER: Instead of jail time.

308
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,356
Do you know
the incarceration rate
for cruelty convictions?

309
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,829
BENSON: About zero.
It's a misdemeanor.

310
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:37,664
$45, few hours
of community service.
Not much of a deterrent.

311
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:42,298
No, but at Ieast with
this program, they are forced
to address their actions.

312
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:45,901
Talk about them.
Now, this kid
who torched the cat.

313
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,210
Harry Baker.
What does he talk about?

314
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,306
If Harry had made
any direct threats,

315
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:55,046
I would have
notified the police
and the person at risk.

316
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,580
And when you say,
"Direct threats"?
Harry has aggression issues.

317
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:02,922
He had a positive tox screen
at birth, cocaine.

318
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:04,723
Makes for a hyperactive kid.

319
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:08,425
Ritalin was recommended
in the first grade.
Harry refused.

320
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,267
Well, didn't his mother
insist?

321
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:14,601
His mother couldn't afford
daycare, so she'd take him
to work with her

322
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:16,663
to her strip club.

323
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:20,507
There was a Iot
of disciplinary problems
for him early in school.

324
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,139
Dumped in Special Ed?
No. Gifted program.

325
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:27,610
Refocused, he'd have
great potential.

326
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:32,115
But right now he does
present as predatory.

327
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:36,892
AII right. AII right.
Well, thank you.
Thanks anyway.

328
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:43,033
You owe me.
Harry Baker's file.

329
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,530
For what?
There's nothing here.

330
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:48,538
I asked for transcripts.
On a juvie?

331
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:52,167
You're Iucky I got
his pre-sentencing report.

332
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:55,041
Probation Officer recommended
intensive supervision

333
00:17:55,113 --> 00:18:00,949
based on Agent Tilden's
suspicion of numerous
unadjudicated prior offenses.

334
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,085
What do you suppose
those were?
Lord knows.

335
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:07,124
Any way we can find out?

336
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:09,220
Shaheen.

337
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:12,261
I have a fact-finding
in 20 minutes
on a 10-year-old

338
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,357
who took a baseball bat
to his grandmother,
and my witness is in the wind.

339
00:18:16,434 --> 00:18:18,595
You know, we never
rescheduled that Iunch.

340
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,639
From a year ago?
What do you want, AIex?

341
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,665
You prosecuted
the Harry Baker case.

342
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,776
Cat flambe boy.

343
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,370
He was only fifteen,
so you know those records
are sealed.

344
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:33,144
But your memory isn't.
A Iot of these cases
are a cry for help.

345
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:36,449
You uncover the dad's
abusing the mom, the mom
in turn abuses the kid.

346
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:38,614
The kid completes the cycle
by abusing the only member

347
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,649
of the family
more vulnerable, the pet.
Right.

348
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:45,662
But I didn't find any history
of physical abuse with Harry.

349
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,358
What did you find?
About a dozen other animals

350
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:51,027
that had turned up dead
and mutilated
in his neighborhood.

351
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:52,626
Could you Iink
any of them to Harry?

352
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:54,797
CIosest we came was a girl
he had the hots for.

353
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:56,864
Let me guess,
she spurned his advances?

354
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,637
She went into a deli,
Ieft her dog tied up outside,

355
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,202
comes back out,
and it's gone.

356
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,943
Could be a coincidence.
It turned up on her stoop
the next morning.

357
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:07,382
Dead?

358
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:08,851
Decapitated.

359
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:20,191
Where was your son
Thursday night between
the hours of 7:00 and 10:00?

360
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:22,460
In his bedroom,
reading, Iike always.

361
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:26,334
Were you here all night?
Sure. I had company.

362
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:31,967
Is this where you sleep?
Yeah, I'm having
the penthouse painted.

363
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:35,308
This Harry's room?
DAISY: The beads.

364
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:40,046
Pretty hard not to
overhear company.
Yeah, or walk in on them.

365
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:42,518
So, what's this
all about anyway?

366
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,388
How Iong has Harry
been killing animals?
He would never do that.

367
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:49,722
He set a cat on fire.
People say these things
about him,

368
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:53,423
but they're just jealous
because their own kids
aren't as gifted.

369
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:55,090
BENSON: He pled guilty.

370
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,629
He's misunderstood.

371
00:19:57,702 --> 00:20:03,470
In science class, he gets
an A-plus because he is
so good at dissecting frogs.

372
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,635
He's just really curious
about the biology stuff.

373
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,440
STABLER: Right.

374
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:10,879
You mind if we take
a Iittle peek in his room?

375
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,940
He's got nothing to hide.

376
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:19,315
Tidy.

377
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,188
Could use a splash of color.
Oh, there you are.

378
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,785
BIood-red wasn't
what I had in mind.

379
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,461
Fire escape right outside
the window.

380
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:31,661
Yeah, how hard would it be
to sneak out
while Mom's entertaining?

381
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:34,796
No smell.
No nooks and crannies
big enough to stash a head.

382
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:36,066
Check out this Iibrary?

383
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,737
True crime, police procedure,
every book ever written
on serial killers.

384
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:45,408
AII in alphabetical order.
HARRY: You Iooking
for something?

385
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:51,077
Harry. I'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

386
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:53,721
It's about Pam, right?

387
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:55,984
That really bites.

388
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,621
Pam?
Officer Tilden.
We were kind of tight.

389
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:03,090
She arrested you,
testified against you,

390
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:04,794
even threw you
into counseling.

391
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:05,858
Yeah.

392
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:09,172
STABLER: You the type
to hold a grudge?

393
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,538
I've been known to,
but Pam was cool.

394
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,878
I read her death
was totally whack.

395
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:18,404
Course, they...
They never publish
all the details.

396
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:22,112
Any you can give me?
No. Any you can give us?

397
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:24,314
What do you mean?

398
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:28,787
STABLER: Well, you got
Pathology of Homicide,

399
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,021
Death Investigator's Handbook,

400
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,928
Seems Iike your interests
run pretty dark.

401
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:38,093
My shrink says I have
an aggressive orientation
to the world.

402
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:41,103
Something about
a predatory drive.

403
00:21:41,172 --> 00:21:45,131
Says if I don't re-channel it,
I could... I could wind up...

404
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:47,973
What'd she say... A cop.

405
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:52,340
Well, we also heard
that you have experience
with surveillance.

406
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,647
Girl in your class,
Carey Thorne?

407
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:57,244
I broke her heart.
BENSON: By killing her dog?

408
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:59,620
No, by ending
our relationship.

409
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,125
Not to sound egotistical
or anything,

410
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:06,990
but I drive the girls
a Iittle crazy.

411
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,595
It was horrible.

412
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:17,607
He was always calling,
following me around.

413
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:20,940
I'd go to the movies
or the ice rink, there he was.

414
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:22,673
He ever threaten you?

415
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:25,841
He used to Ieave these
creepy Ietters in my Iocker.

416
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:28,715
I was scared for my Iife.
Describe creepy.

417
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:32,955
Like, he's Iiving
only for me.

418
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:36,084
He dreamed we died
in a car crash together.

419
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,685
Or, if he can't have me,
nobody can.

420
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:41,932
You still have
any of these Ietters?
God, no. I burned them.

421
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:45,332
Did you notify the police?
They talked to Harry.

422
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:48,201
He turned on the charm,
got his friends
to Iie for him.

423
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,297
Suddenly, at school,
I'm the nutcase.

424
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,343
Your friends seen
any of these Ietters?

425
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,878
They were Iike,
"What's your problem?
He's so cute."

426
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:56,972
We need to get Harry
off the street, but we're
gonna need your help.

427
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,175
You don't get it.

428
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,981
AII I did was
turn him down for a date,
and he killed my dog.

429
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:03,749
I'm not messing with Harry.

430
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:07,189
Could you at Ieast
steer us toward someone
who would?

431
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:15,261
FIN: Phillip. Oh, Phillip.

432
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:19,861
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

433
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:24,869
Now, what have we here?

434
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:28,310
This door
appears to be Iocked,
but do you see Iegs?

435
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,348
No, must not be here.

436
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:37,511
Cooking spray.

437
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:39,853
Now, what do you suppose
he thinks is gonna get stuck?

438
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,586
Come on out, Phil.

439
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:47,591
What do you guys want?
FIN: Lowdown
on your buddy, Harry.

440
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:51,762
We're not tight anymore.
Let me guess,
you're missing a pet?

441
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:55,601
Dude's obsessed with death.
And it's one thing
to hate cats,

442
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:58,643
but Harry went super freak.

443
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,201
FIN: Anything involving
a hunting knife?

444
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,712
Where does he keep it?
How should I know?

445
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:04,806
See.

446
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:08,512
You're burning out
too many brain cells.
Affects your memory.

447
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:11,078
Maybe we should give
his principal and parents
the 411

448
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:13,181
on his Iittle huffing habit.
AII right.

449
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:15,818
He's got this place
in Central Park.

450
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:19,193
It's private,
so he can be alone
with his collection.

451
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:20,993
Collection of what?

452
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:23,061
Skulls.

453
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:27,172
(SIRENS WAILING)
CRAGEN: The kid told us

454
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:31,835
that Harry's been slicing
and dicing furry things
for years.

455
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,845
You got a fix
on him, yet?
Yeah.

456
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:37,074
He's a sadistic sociopath.

457
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:40,585
He Iikes to take his time,
draw out the pain.

458
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:43,644
He gets off on the control
and the domination.

459
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:46,088
During the torture,
he feels no empathy,

460
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:48,820
and when it's over,
he feels no remorse.

461
00:24:49,228 --> 00:24:53,255
Okay,
but what I don't get is this.
His burial ground is here.

462
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:55,960
Why Iure Agent Tilden
to Riverside Park?

463
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:57,501
TECH HARRY: Look at this.

464
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:04,540
Open it up.

465
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:10,275
Harry's heads.

466
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:14,416
Looks Iike there's about
a dozen in there.
They're small.

467
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:16,511
My guess is cats and dogs.

468
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:28,123
Big. I'd say hunting.
Get this to the Iab.

469
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,168
Anything human in there?

470
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:33,997
TECH HARRY: No.

471
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:37,203
I don't understand
why we're here.

472
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:39,744
They think I killed
two people.

473
00:25:39,811 --> 00:25:43,645
DAISY: That's ridiculous.
Harry's a good boy.
He gets straight A's.

474
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:47,913
Well, he also gets his kicks
playing with the heads
of animals he's butchered.

475
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:51,183
That's not true. Harry?
Take a pill, Mom.

476
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:53,383
I'm not gonna Iisten
to these Iies.

477
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,085
It's just an
interrogation technique.

478
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,320
Now they've got you
good and riled,

479
00:25:56,395 --> 00:25:58,522
and it's time for Q and A.

480
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:01,293
First, they'd wanna know
if I'm a bed wetter.

481
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:03,596
This is all about
the accident with the cat.

482
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,864
(SIGHING)
That gave them fire setting
and animal abuse.

483
00:26:05,938 --> 00:26:08,839
Throw in enuresis
and I fit the triad
of sociopathy.

484
00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:11,967
Three childhood indicators
of a future serial killer.

485
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:13,944
So, did he wet his bed?

486
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:16,905
Can we go now?

487
00:26:16,982 --> 00:26:21,316
Harry, animal torture,
that's the biggie.

488
00:26:21,587 --> 00:26:23,987
That's true. I mean, Iook at
all the major Ieaguers.

489
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:28,686
As a kid, Jeffrey Dahmer
used to impale dogs and frogs
and cats on sticks.

490
00:26:29,294 --> 00:26:32,024
AIbert Desalvo,
the alleged Boston Strangler.

491
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:34,156
He used to take dogs and cats
and put them in crates

492
00:26:34,232 --> 00:26:35,893
and then shoot arrows
through the slats.

493
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:39,369
And Iittle Teddy Bundy,
I mean, he killed
more than his share.

494
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:42,865
As did... As did Son of Sam.

495
00:26:44,443 --> 00:26:46,308
Andrew Cunanan.

496
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:49,513
Most of your high school
shooters Iike Kip Kinkel...

497
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:52,379
I mean, the list goes
on and on and on,,,
Stop it!

498
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:54,941
(CHUCKLES)

499
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,587
That is one cold kid.

500
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,627
No conscience,
no regard for others,

501
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:06,858
and yet superficially
charming, manipulative.

502
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:10,868
And an expert on everything,
whether he did it or not.

503
00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:14,963
Mrs. Baker needs a break.
She's waived Harry's Miranda.

504
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,099
Let's get you some coffee.

505
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:24,675
This kid knows all the tricks.
Any suggestions?

506
00:27:25,317 --> 00:27:27,717
His ego is too inflated
not to instruct and inform.

507
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:31,222
Get him to talk about it
hypothetically, third person.

508
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,686
We've got your knife, kid.

509
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:39,128
It's only a matter of time
before they find
the victims' blood on it.

510
00:27:39,197 --> 00:27:43,156
Look, if it was me,
I would have cleaned it
very thoroughly,

511
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:45,327
but it wasn't me.
BENSON: Okay.

512
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:47,901
Well, then, who was it?

513
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:49,530
Sorry, I can't
help you there.

514
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:53,305
Wow, all those books,
you can't put together
a simple profile?

515
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:59,708
Caucasian male.
Late 30s, early 40s.

516
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,788
Menial job. Lives alone.

517
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:06,447
How'd he do it?

518
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:10,454
He was already in the park.
He was waiting in the shadows.

519
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:13,993
It took her
a while to find it,
but he didn't mind.

520
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,534
The hunt's the most
exciting part.

521
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:19,661
Took her a while
to find what?
The injured animal.

522
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:25,403
If he knew her,
that's what he used as bait.
I mean, why else would she go?

523
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:28,607
Why her?

524
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,348
Maybe she rejected
his advances.

525
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:37,949
STABLER:
So he Iures her to the park,
then what?

526
00:28:39,624 --> 00:28:41,990
He takes her
to a private place

527
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:45,858
where he can be alone
with her a while.

528
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:51,124
'Cause he owns her now.
He owns her body, her soul.

529
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:55,896
And now he can do
whatever he wants.

530
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,802
Agent Tilden was in prime
physical condition.

531
00:28:58,878 --> 00:29:00,345
She carried a gun.

532
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:02,381
I don't see how
he could've overpowered her.

533
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:04,075
She never saw him.

534
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,441
She was preoccupied.

535
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,420
She was bent over the animal
and it was a blitz attack.

536
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:11,081
What did he use?

537
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:16,123
Something handy.

538
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,231
Like a rock.

539
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,064
Was that detail
ever released?

540
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,373
No.
Could be a Iucky guess.

541
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:36,347
I don't care
if it's a psychic vision,
it's enough to book him.

542
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:44,186
Just finished
processing Harry.

543
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:46,748
He actually hit on
the mug shot photographer.

544
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,488
We get the Iab results
back for the knife?
CIean.

545
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:51,291
What's Cragen doing here
this Iate?

546
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:53,992
MUNCH: Running us ragged.
LUDs finally came back
from Tilden's cell.

547
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:57,331
Her Iast call came in
at 6:37 p.m. from MFPCA.

548
00:29:57,403 --> 00:30:00,031
Dispatch said that
her Iast call came in at 5:30.

549
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:03,439
Didn't come from dispatch.
We traced it to a phone
down in the kennels.

550
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:06,967
Finally finished running
all their employees. Only one
popped up in the system.

551
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:09,014
Who?
CRAGEN: Joe Poletti.

552
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:14,976
We talked to him.
He's a dog walker.

553
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:17,581
And a seven-time rapist.

554
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,130
Detectives.
BENSON: In there, Poletti.

555
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:29,658
Hey, that's the guy
from the kennel, right?
Is he the one who did it?

556
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:32,295
What are we doing
with him?
Cutting him Ioose.

557
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:36,831
Let's do this again
real soon.
Count on it.

558
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:44,575
I was in Atlantic City.
Left right after work.

559
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:46,310
I hit a royal.

560
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:50,845
Joey, you called Agent Tilden
from the kennel at 6:37 p.m.

561
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:54,953
It wasn't me.
A Iot of people have access
to that phone.

562
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,927
How'd you get down
to AC?
My van.

563
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:59,191
He's got a van.
Yeah, they all do.

564
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,927
Don't tell me,
you just had it detailed.

565
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:03,491
It's funny you should say
'cause I was about to,

566
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:07,369
but someone swiped it.
Joe, can you breathe
without Iying?

567
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,431
STABLER: You file
a police report?

568
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,641
No. Can I do that here?

569
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:15,044
Don't worry,
we're gonna find
that van for you.

570
00:31:15,114 --> 00:31:17,605
Does anyone down at the "M"
know your past?

571
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,241
Hmm?

572
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:23,080
(CLEARS THROAT)

573
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,383
It never came up.

574
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,991
It should've
on your job application.

575
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,493
You should know
that's a violation,

576
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:31,189
the number of times
you've been on parole.

577
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,198
BENSON: Took your first
rape collar at 18.

578
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,928
Got Iucky
with that one. Probation.
That's ancient history.

579
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:38,630
Oh, history has a way
of repeating itself.

580
00:31:38,704 --> 00:31:41,172
You did three years
for the rape of Coral Jividen.

581
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,299
She was my girlfriend.
She was 14 years old.

582
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:45,503
You're out, what, two weeks
before you start your string.

583
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,808
STABLER: Five break-in rapes
all at knifepoint.

584
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,542
I don't have
those feelings anymore.

585
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:54,074
That'd make you the first
I've come across.
I got help.

586
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:55,950
I never missed a session
while I was in.

587
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:58,456
I finished the program
after I got out,
three years ago.

588
00:31:58,524 --> 00:32:00,219
Three years
of that pressure building.

589
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,557
Pam Tilden was at that kennel
every single day

590
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:06,428
and you try to fight
those urges, but they kept
getting stronger and stronger.

591
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,228
The walls you build up
crumble.

592
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,598
You pick up right where
you Ieft off.

593
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:10,863
Okay, I was sick back then.

594
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:13,201
But, tell me, how many
of those people I killed?

595
00:32:13,272 --> 00:32:14,330
Huh?
STABLER: None.

596
00:32:14,407 --> 00:32:18,104
That's why you did
twelve years. Living victims,
Iiving witnesses.

597
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:19,235
You didn't wanna go back,

598
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,837
and that's why you killed
Pam Tilden and Ed Boggs.

599
00:32:21,914 --> 00:32:24,348
No.
That's why you cut off
her head and hands,

600
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:27,079
so she couldn't be
Iinked to you.
No!

601
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,490
I'm rehabilitated.

602
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:45,727
PIease tell me
there's a head in there.

603
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:48,103
We tore Poletti's house apart.
This is all we could find.

604
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,472
His pleasure chest.

605
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:54,640
Victoria's Secret catalogs,
strip club flyers.

606
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:57,013
Personal ads
from New York Magazine,

607
00:32:57,084 --> 00:33:00,315
Called a few 900 numbers.
Sex chats are
on his no-no Iist.

608
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:03,322
Yeah, but we want him
for murder, not some
pissant parole violation.

609
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,655
You want him off the street
or what? We're getting him
on what we can.

610
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:09,560
Pretty gray area stuff.
I doubt a hearing officer
will even go for it.

611
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:11,927
I'II take anything
at this point.
What will it get him?

612
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:15,196
Whatever he still owes
on his parole.
Three weeks, two days.

613
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:16,929
There you go,
now there's justice.

614
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:18,562
Three weeks
for a double murder.

615
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:21,903
This is plenty of time
for him to rest up
and find his next attack.

616
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:24,102
MUNCH: Or catch up
on his writing.

617
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:26,001
Prolific Iittle bastard.

618
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,980
About twenty short stories
of wall-to-wall rape torture.

619
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,711
Anything in there
a thinly veiled Tilden/Boggs
confession?

620
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:35,243
No, but a rave review
from one of his old
offender program buddies.

621
00:33:35,322 --> 00:33:37,552
He sent them
to another sex offender?

622
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,353
"Joe, Iast batch
was your best, yet.

623
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,894
"Jumper cables
to the girls' goodies
finished me off.

624
00:33:41,962 --> 00:33:45,363
"Send extra copies
of the next one. They're
a big hit with the guys."

625
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:47,059
Let me see those.

626
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,798
CONRAD:
They're his private thoughts.

627
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,399
That's funny,
I saw them in print.

628
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:59,809
People v, Kirkpatrick
found mere possession
of obscene material

629
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,145
without dissemination
is not subject
to prosecution.

630
00:34:03,216 --> 00:34:05,207
He mailed more than
six copies of his story,

631
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:06,718
meeting the presumption
of dissemination.

632
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:09,756
He sent them to friends.
Fellow sex offenders.

633
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:12,018
Don't you see
what the A.D.A. is doing?

634
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,925
She couldn't substantiate
murder charges
against my client,

635
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:17,987
so she's shooting blind,
seeing what sticks.

636
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:20,795
I do not take
a serial rapist's graphically
violent writings

637
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:23,097
about the torture of women
and children Iightly.

638
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,230
This is back door,
and you know it.
Your client opened that door.

639
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,536
Save it for the ethics board,
Miss Conrad.

640
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,634
I'm only here
to decide whether the charge
tracks under the statute.

641
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:36,148
The obscenity statute
is overly broad and void
for its vagueness.

642
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:38,013
It encompasses everything
and nothing.

643
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:40,315
CABOT: In the venerable words
of Justice Potter Stewart,

644
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:43,550
"I can't define it,
but I know it when I see it."

645
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:47,389
Two words, First Amendment.

646
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,328
The Supreme Court
has come down on the side
of Iimiting free speech

647
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:54,197
when the need
to protect the public
is of overriding importance.

648
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:58,460
I'm inclined to think
you're over-reaching
on this one, Miss Cabot,

649
00:34:58,538 --> 00:35:00,870
but I'm going to Iet
a jury decide.

650
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:11,846
JUDGE: Mr. Foreman,
have the members of the jury
reached a verdict?

651
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,955
FOREPERSON:
We have, Your Honor.
What is your verdict?

652
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:19,185
On the sole count,
obscenity in the Third Degree,

653
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:22,626
we find the defendant,
Joseph Paul Poletti,

654
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:23,822
guilty.

655
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:25,194
(PEOPLE MUTTERING)

656
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,361
Motion to set aside verdict.

657
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,130
Denied.

658
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:33,401
JUDGE: Remand continued
until sentencing.

659
00:35:33,473 --> 00:35:34,633
(GAVEL BANGS)

660
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,242
Nice snow job.
Well, I knew I had him

661
00:35:43,316 --> 00:35:46,217
when juror number six
asked me to stop reading
one page into it.

662
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:48,550
It's a misdemeanor.
One year max.

663
00:35:48,622 --> 00:35:50,783
There's no statute
of Iimitations on murder.

664
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,315
That year
is what I've just bought you
to find the head.

665
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:08,407
What are you doing here?

666
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,638
Homework.

667
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:13,311
Come here,
you sick Iittle freak.

668
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Criminology 101, Detective.

669
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:19,478
If you're gonna break the Iaw,
you don't want
witnesses around.

670
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:22,485
You think you're real cute,
don't you?

671
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,217
Twenty-three cheerleaders
can't be wrong.

672
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:26,191
I know where you Iive,
I know where you Iearn,

673
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:28,955
and I know where
you bury your kill.

674
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,053
You get used to my face,
'cause you're gonna be
seeing it

675
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:35,090
every time you turn around.
Don't Iose your head,
Detective,

676
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:37,329
you're having enough trouble
finding one.

677
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:42,505
That's good. We found
your whole stash.

678
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:49,441
You think? There never is
just one stash.

679
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:57,612
We gave up too easily.
We didn't find Poletti's
real stash.

680
00:36:57,691 --> 00:37:00,956
Go back through that house
over every scrap of paper,

681
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:02,858
pull up his financials,
dig up the backyard.

682
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,330
I want every key he owns
matched to a Iock,
every Iock accounted for.

683
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:13,332
Poletti's stolen van.

684
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:15,065
Jackpot.

685
00:37:18,178 --> 00:37:21,739
Joey's Iittle
reading room.
His own Yankee Stadium.

686
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:25,981
Not here.

687
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,085
I think we got blood stains.

688
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:34,048
It's blood, all right.
STABLER:
So match it to Tilden.

689
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,992
That's problematic.
Why?

690
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:39,793
Because
of the cell-surface antigens.
It's canine blood.

691
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:42,130
He tracked it in here
from work.

692
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:43,863
We Iost him again.

693
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,733
Have a Iittle faith.

694
00:37:46,106 --> 00:37:48,904
I got his travel itinerary
off his tires.

695
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:52,975
South Jersey, above bedrock,
is unconsolidated marine sand.

696
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:55,037
Atlantic City.
He already told us that.

697
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:57,982
Did he mention something about
a skid mark along the way?

698
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:00,451
Or a sharp U-y?
How do you know that?

699
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,182
I found microscopic fragments
of glass beads

700
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:05,816
and of yellow and white
reflective paint.

701
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:08,417
GIass beads could be
any stretch of road,
but the paint...

702
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,794
Yellow and white together
could be a hill
or a sharp curve.

703
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:16,234
The outer depositional strata
of dirt says he then pulled
off of the paved road.

704
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:21,206
We got a heavy buildup
of soil inside a wheel well
and inside the bumper.

705
00:38:21,274 --> 00:38:22,866
He spun his tire
in the mud.

706
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:26,400
I got shoeprints
inside the van,
the same consistency.

707
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:29,809
So he got out of the van
to dump the head, and then
he floored it out of there.

708
00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:32,408
Do we have a clue
as to where "there" is?

709
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:35,249
Some place with a high Ievel
of soil contamination.

710
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:37,552
BENSON: What kind?
Chemical byproducts.

711
00:38:37,624 --> 00:38:40,991
X-ray fluorescence
spectrometer will give us
the exact composition.

712
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:44,087
You're saying it's near
a chemical plant.
What, with Ievels this high,

713
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:47,600
I say he practically
stopped on top
of one's drainage ditch.

714
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:51,003
Think you got enough red
up there?
Garden State, my ass.

715
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:53,802
I guess "Chemical Capital
of the World" didn't have
the same zing to it.

716
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:56,274
Well, Iet's narrow it down
to the ones along his route.

717
00:38:56,344 --> 00:39:00,007
From the crime scene to AC.

718
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:02,276
Now we've confirmed
that he made it all the way
down there?

719
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,578
He was there.
He didn't get a room,

720
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:05,084
but he gambled
until 5:00 in the morning.

721
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:08,019
He pulled on his first
one-armed bandit at 12:52.

722
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:09,078
Which fits the window.

723
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:10,953
Has him Ieaving Manhattan
between 10:00 and 11:00.

724
00:39:11,025 --> 00:39:12,492
How do we know the times?

725
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,960
Well, we spoke to the casino.
He uses a player's card.

726
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:17,190
Just missed winning
the free Wayne Newton tickets.

727
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:21,200
Okay. So from the crime scene,
he jumps on
the West Side Highway.

728
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:24,431
BENSON: Finds his way
over the Manhattan Bridge
down to the BQE.

729
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:26,803
On and off to ditch the hands
but not the head?

730
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:28,273
Well, CSU measured.

731
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:30,333
Head was too big
to fit through
the sewer grate.

732
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:33,744
CRAGEN:
Right, so he continues down
over the Verrazano Bridge,

733
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:36,908
maybe a quick stop at home?
Tossed the house.
Nothing there.

734
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:40,147
AII right,
then he continues on
over the outer bridge,

735
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:44,248
and it is a straight shot
down the parkway.

736
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:46,691
Easy access
to about eight plants.

737
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,023
Mercury.

738
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:51,326
The soil contained
absurdly high Ievels
of mercury.

739
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,162
We're Iooking
for a mercury plant?
No, no.

740

PIants use mercury
as a cathode.

741
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:57,869
A current is passed through
electrolytic cells

742
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,964
to decompose salt brine.
The end product being?

743
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,066
Chlorine
and sodium hydroxide.

744
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:05,669
How many plants
are there in Jersey
that produce that?

745
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,214
Hold on. I also found
a Iow pH Ievel.

746
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,477
It might also produce
hydrochloric acid.

747
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:13,111
Ramone, how many plants
we talking?
Just one.

748
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:15,451
IDJ Chemicals.
It's right in Toms River.

749

Right off the Parkway.

751
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,561
They're giving up.

752
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:30,100
There's still one diver
down there.

753
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:31,229
You know how cold
that water is?

754
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:34,206
They were supposed to be up
45 minutes ago.

755
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:43,076
They'II find it.
They found Poletti's
tire tracks.

756
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,211
Doesn't mean a thing
without that head.
CIothing, knife, anything.

757
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:49,347
Come back out tomorrow.

758
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:52,425
You find anything?
Big party spot.

759
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,825
We got beer cans,
couple hundred
cigarette butts.

760
00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:58,661
A bra that's been here
about two years
and an earring.

761
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:00,527
Let me see that.

What do you want?

765
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:20,551
Nothing. I just came
by to gloat.
Yeah?

766
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:25,549
Don't over-excite yourself.
I can do a year
standing on my head.

767
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,893
What the hell is that?
It's a Iittle
doggie earring.

768
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:32,797
Eighteen karats.
You don't recognize that?

769
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:38,404
That's funny, because
we found it where you dumped
Pam Tilden's head.

770
00:41:38,472 --> 00:41:40,633
You can't prove it's hers.

771
00:41:40,741 --> 00:41:45,440
It was made especially for her
to commemorate
five years on the force.

772
00:41:48,983 --> 00:41:52,009
Doesn't mean jack.
It's got her DNA on it

773
00:41:53,087 --> 00:41:56,056
and a three-point match
to your thumbprint.
