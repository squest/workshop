NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:03,999
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:05,199
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:08,175
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:11,771
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,543
These are their stories,

7
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,476
FRANK: I'II get a cab.

8
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:21,256
How's it going?
Is it a Iove connection?

9
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:22,723
I don't think he Iikes me.

10
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:27,422
That's crazy. You're adorable.
Definitely Steve's type.
Talk to him.

11
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:32,225
Sorry. I didn't mean...
It's fine. It's all right.

12
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm just really nervous.

13
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:40,631
Me, too.
I think we both need to relax.
I know this great piano bar.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,371
(GUN FIRING)

15
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:44,743
Get out of here. I'II call.

16
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:50,218
Hold it!
Let me see your hands!

17
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,579
Now!
Okay.

18
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:59,051
My name's Phil.

19
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:01,687
I sleep here.

20
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,906
Detective Nathan?
Steve.

21
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:13,203
OIivia, this is EIIiot.

22
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:15,870
Your John Doe's a white male,
early mid-20s.

23
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,503
Caught a slug in the gut.

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,946
Crime scene's an alley
off of a bar called Puffy's.

25
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:22,246
I'm not sure, but I think
I saw the victim inside.

26
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:23,580
Inside the bar?

27
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:27,384
I was on a date.
Set up by friends.
Made a great first impression.

28
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:28,924
Do we suspect a gay bashing?

29
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:31,960
Can't say for sure.
Victim was gang-raped.
That's why I called you.

30
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:33,325
Doctors found copious fluids.

31
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:34,420
Witness?

32
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:36,158
Name's Phil Kastner.

33
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:38,393
Brick chip caught him
in the cheek
from the ricochet.

34
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,959
CIaims he just got there
wanting to bed down.

35
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,470
STABLER: What,
you don't believe him?

36
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:46,338
Sounds good, but he's pretty
clean for a street sleeper.

37
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,173
Uniforms took him for a meal
but I'II make sure
he gets to the squad.

38
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,234
Okay. Thanks for your help.

39
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,372
You need anything else,
you can reach me at the 25.

40
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,814
Okay. You know, Steve,
if you want
a Iittle discretion on this,

41
00:01:54,884 --> 00:01:56,112
we can try
and keep you out of it.

42
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:58,483
I don't broadcast,
but the brass already knows.

43
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:01,148
Thanks for asking, though.
Okay. Take it easy.

44
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,692
BENSON: I'II need
to see the wound, please.

45
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:08,155
It's an old scar.
Doubt he uses that hand much.

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,227
Okay. No other wounds,
no tattoos.
So, just this scar?

47
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,800
Yeah.
And a wedding ring.

48
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:18,431
Well, if he was
in a committed relationship,

49
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:20,567
we might be able to get a hit
off Missing Persons.

50
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:25,376
He's in a meat market bar.
Let's hope his partner's
more committed than he is.

51
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,891
Thanks for the shower
and the clothes.

52
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:22,665
I do Iaundry on Thursdays,
so I'II wash these
and I'II bring them back.

53
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:24,103
STABLER: Yours to keep.

54
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:27,074
No, no, no, no.
I appreciate that
but I've got plenty.

55
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:29,907
I'II give them to somebody
who needs them.

56
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,742
You a junkie, Phil?

57
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:35,341
Sugar gave me away, huh?

58
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:36,715
How Iong you been clean?

59
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:38,253
Sixty-four days,

60
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:42,621
five hours, twelve minutes,
six seconds.

61
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:45,160
Seven, eight, nine...

62
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:49,798
Sebastian, he's my counselor.
He gave me the watch.

63
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:52,891
Said I needed to tell time
to know how precious it is.

64
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,460
It's precious agony.
Yeah.

65
00:03:57,306 --> 00:04:00,366
Okay, the alley outside
of Puffy's, is that
where you usually rest?

66
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:04,436
Yeah. The gays, they treat
me human, so I stay there
when I can't find a bed.

67
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:06,276
Where do you usually stay?

68
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,284
Mission on 10th
when I'm not in rehab.

69
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:12,083
You see the shooter, Phil?

70
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:15,715
It was dark, but I got
a good Iook at him
when he broke the alley.

71
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:20,285
Brown hair,
between 5'10" and 6 feet.
I didn't see his eyes, though.

72
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:22,160
You see the gun?

73
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:24,922
Snub-nose revolver.
Probably a.38.

74
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:32,435
I was a master sergeant,
Parris Island.

75
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,771
It was a Iifetime ago.

76
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:36,971
You know, Phil,
veterans are eligible

77
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:39,173
for Uncle Sam benefits.
You know that, right?

78
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:40,772
Not without an address.

79
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,217
The waiting Iist for housing,
oh, it's awfully Iong.

80
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:48,724
How much of this addict's
statement can we believe?

81
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,986
I'd say all of it. He was
Iucid enough for details.

82
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,019
If we find our shooter,
Phil's testimony won't hold up
in court without help.

83
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:57,395
It's putting the proverbial
cart, don't you think?

84
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,297
Get him to agree
to a blood test.

85
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:02,599
If his tox screen
shows he's clean now,
the Iawyers can't argue Iater.

86
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:04,367
Good thing you know
the drug business.

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,601
GIad I could bring
something to the table.

88
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:08,075
I didn't mean that.
Forget it.

89
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:11,238
Look, get on it before
we Iose Phil to the street.

90
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,407
What's with him?
What's the word
on our John Doe,

91
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:15,040
and what the hell was he doing
in that alley?

92
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:18,951
No solicitation, hits.
Vice couldn't ID him
from the photo or the prints,

93
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:20,215
so he's not a known pro.

94
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:23,224
Doctors found three different
blood types in the semen.

95
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,021
This Iooks Iike
a rape gang-bang.

96
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:26,561
Good money's on a hate crime.

97
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,325
Perps are usually hetero,
or closeted and in denial.

98
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:33,801
Well, there was a ring
on his finger. So, maybe
he's cheating, wanted out.

99
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,734
Picked up the wrong guys
in the meat market.

100
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,136
John, you're on missing
persons.

101
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:42,200
While you two canvass
that bar, see if our John Doe
introduced himself around.

102
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:44,439
Looked a hell of a Iot better
than that Iast night.

103
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:47,311
Did you catch a name?
No. I'm not his type.

104
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,318
Pretty boys tend to
stick together.
Did you see someone with him?

105
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,549
Yeah, one of our regulars,
but he's not into
working guys over.

106
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:56,216
Well, we'II still
need to talk to him.
This regular have a name?

107
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:59,693
Being gay doesn't mean
being violent.
Whoever did that was straight.

108
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:03,698
As a matter of fact,
gay bashers
Iook a Iot Iike you.

109
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:07,133
Look, we really don't want
a hassle, but this is how
it's gonna play out.

110
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:09,694
We come back here
with a warrant,
we go through your receipts,

111
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:12,707
and while we're doing that,
we close down your bar.

112
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:16,267
Name's Willem. I know him.
He didn't do this.

113
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:19,712
They had a drink at the bar.
Will passed him
a thick envelope.

114
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:21,010
Did you see
what was in the envelope?

115
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,813
No, and I didn't overhear
any conversation, either.

116
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:25,513
Music here gets pretty Ioud.

117
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:26,577
Did they Ieave together?

118
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:27,849
Your guy Ieft alone.

119
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:29,686
Hard to believe,
with a body Iike that.

120
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,124
STABLER:
What about this Willem?

121
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,717
Left at Iast call.

122
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,389
Okay. We'II need to
hear that from him, so,
do you have an address?

123
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:39,560
No, but you can find one
from the credit card receipts.

124
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,471
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

125
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:48,669
Yes?

126
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,006
You Willem Mueller?

127
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,311
No. Ray Borland.
Willem's my houseboy.
What's he done this time?

128
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:56,613
We just need to talk to him.
Is he in?

129
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:58,516
He's picking up my Iaundry.
What's this about?

130
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,613
Have you ever seen this man
with Mr. Mueller?

131
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,887
No, I haven't. I'm pretty
sure he'II be back soon.

132
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:08,862
Okay. Have him give us a call
when he comes in.

133
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,831
Thank you, Mr. Borland.

134
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:15,068
Houseboy?

135
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:18,774
Guess that's what
they're called these days.

136
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,674
He fits the witness
description.

137
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:26,338
Willem Mueller? We'd Iike to
talk to you about Iast night.

138
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:32,754
Seven years in Sing Sing.
Possession with Intent
and assault two.

139
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,619
I've changed my evil ways.

140
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,817
Not in this Iifetime.
Recognize him?

141
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:38,519
Had a couple drinks. So what?

142
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:41,324
He was found worked over
in that alley
in more ways than one,

143
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,627
and you were the Iast person
seen with him.

144
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,894
I didn't touch him.
Not even for fun.

145
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:47,162
What's his name?

146
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:48,965
Peter Ivanhoe.

147
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,199
That for real?
It's what he said.

148
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,298
What was the envelope for?

149
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:55,173
I was paying for a job.

150
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:57,269
What was he running for you,
coke or crystal meth?

151
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,177
Not that kind of job.
I'm out of that business.

152
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,943
Well, what, then?

153
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:02,540
I plead the fifth.
He pleads the fifth.

154
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:04,950
You're not on trial.
BENSON: Yet.

155
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,851
Terence Moore,
representing Mr. Mueller,

156
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:08,981
who is done talking
unless you're charging him.

157
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:11,788
He's free to go
after we get his DNA.

158
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,158
You're gonna need a warrant.

159
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,753
Not a problem.
Known violent ex-con

160
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,128
who just happens to be
the Iast person
seen with the victim.

161
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,533
We're just waiting for
the Iab tech, so why don't you
have a seat, Counselor?

162
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:26,764
Have an orange juice.
Natural sugar's
better than a candy bar.

163
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,400
Oh, thanks.

164
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:31,310
We're holding a suspect,
so if it pans out,
we'II do a Iineup.

165
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,938
You know where to find me.

166
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:36,314
You're thinking
about it right now,
just using one more time.

167
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,784
AII day, every day.

168
00:08:37,853 --> 00:08:40,151
And one more time
will kill you, Phil.
You know that, right?

169
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:42,383
Smoker doesn't know
which cigarette
will give him cancer.

170
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,985
Drinker doesn't know which
cocktail will give him
cirrhosis. It's a compulsion.

171
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,894
You gotta stop making excuses.
Take this.

172
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:51,566
We get Mueller's DNA?

173
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:52,828
It's on its way to the Iab.

174
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:55,166
Anything on the victim
from Missing Persons?

175
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,899
National Center for
Missing & Exploited Children
got a hit.

176
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:00,271
In Cedar Creek, Arkansas,
a 17-year-old boy

177
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,333
Wesley Jansen
went missing in 1993.

178
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,936
STABLER: Juvenile records?
No. Part of the kids'
fingerprint program.

179
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,140
You contacted his parents?

180
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:07,307
They're flying in.

181
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:09,783
What's the connection between
the runaway and the ex-con?

182
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:12,616
Well, Mueller played dumb
on the envelope, but he's been
in the drug trade,

183
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:15,919
so it's a dope payoff
or money to make a buy.

184
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:19,825
If he's making bank selling
drugs, then why's he doing
Ray Borland's Iaundry?

185
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:22,159
I checked with Narcotics.
Borland's a player.

186
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,631
Got caught holding on a couple
of big-time possession beefs.

187
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,928
Bought his way out from under.

188
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:28,561
He was connected. The real
Iaundry is cleaning money.

189
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:31,970
So, Mueller fronts as
Borland's man on the street.

190
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,805
Wesley Jansen, a.k.a.
Peter Ivanhoe,
is either a dealer...

191
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:37,311
Thanks.
...mule or a client.

192
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,679
Hospital just called.
Our victim is awake,
so go ask him nicely.

193
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,779
STABLER: Who's Wesley Jansen?

194
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:50,324
If that's the name
of my roomie, he's gone.

195
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,383
Do you know where he went?
He didn't talk to me.

196
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:53,723
Well, what time did he skip?

197
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,058
About 30 minutes ago.

198
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,065
He Iost it
when the nurse told him
the cops were on the way.

199
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,658
You Iet John Doe just walk
out of here with a gut wound?

200
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,499
He's ambulatory,
but just barely.

201
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:05,802
The dressing
has to be changed. He needs
round-the-clock antibiotics.

202
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:08,434
This guy will be back
with a staph infection.

203
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,637
Did he have any visitors
coming in or out of here?

204
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:13,511
Not a soul. AII he did
was yak on the phone.

205
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:16,380
"I Iove you. Don't worry.
See you soon."

206
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:20,655
Well, the idea
of talking to the cops
spooked him so much

207
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:22,122
that he runs with
a bullet wound in his gut.

208
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:25,490
Someone had to pick him up.
We'II dump his phones
and find out who.

209
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,521
Open up. Police.

210
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:32,091
TV's on. It's a good sign.

211
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:37,930
Oh, God. What?

212
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,338
Wesley Jansen?
Yeah.

213
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:40,966
Can we come in?

214
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,144
Nice place.
Sure beats a hospital room.

215
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:49,047
Yeah. I'm gonna pay
for that bill, I swear.

216
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:51,382
This isn't about the bill.
It's about your assault.

217
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:53,148
Yeah. Okay.

218
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:54,655
We'd Iike you to come down
to the station

219
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:58,682
so we can take your statement,
or we can take you back
to the hospital.

220
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:02,986
Look, I don't have
any insurance, and I didn't
see the guy who attacked me.

221
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,659
So, I was mugged.
It happens all the time,
right?

222
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,258
So, why are you packing?

223
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:10,828
I just thought I'd take
a break from the city.

224
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:16,501
You seem a Iittle jumpy,
a Iittle nervous. Even scared.

225
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:19,546
I was attacked.
How should I act?

226
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:22,878
Is someone after you?
No.

227
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:25,343
You being threatened?
No.

228
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:29,320
BENSON: Wesley,
we know about the rape.
That's crazy.

229
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:31,552
Well, we've got semen
from the three different men

230
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,925
and a gun shot wound here.

231
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,428
What are you doing out of bed?

232
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,893
You're gonna kill yourself.

233
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:44,163
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, baby.

234
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,604
JAINA: Are you the police?

235
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:48,165
Yeah. We're here about
Wesley's assault.

236
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:51,770
I'm Jaina, Wesley's wife.
This is our Mara.

237
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:54,806
Here's your pills.

238
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:55,941
Thanks.

239
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:00,247
JAINA: So, did you
catch that mugger?

240
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:02,813
No, sweetheart,
I told them that I'd be okay.

241
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,984
We're still gonna want Wesley
to come down to the station

242
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,051
to answer a few questions.

243
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:12,057
Maybe when
he's feeling better.

244
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:16,036
Precinct or hospital,
your choice,
but we need a statement now.

245
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,307
Like I said,
the whole thing is a blank.

246
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:20,739
We appreciate your time,
anyway.

247
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:24,267
I'II show these people
to the interview room.
This way.

248
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:27,247
What's going on?
Captain wants to see you.

249
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:28,715
About what?

250
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,245
Parents are here.

251
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,680
Wesley.

252
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:34,684
Mom, Dad.

253
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:35,815
(CRYING)

254
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,984
No. Take it easy.
What happened, son?

255
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,425
Nothing. I'm okay.

256
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,292
It's been eight years.

257
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:43,991
I'm just so happy
to see you're alive.

258
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,267
STABLER: Are you ready
to talk, Wesley?

259
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:51,238
Why'd you call my parents?
I don't want them here.

260
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,934
Why'd you run away?
They do something to you?

261
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't want to talk about it.

262
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,343
Fine. We're only interested
in your assault and the rape.

263
00:12:59,414 --> 00:13:00,438
No one raped me.

264
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:03,041
Then how do you explain
the semen inside of you?

265
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:04,517
Was it consensual?

266
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:05,951
I'm married. I've got a kid.

267
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:10,082
Look, Iots of people hit for
both teams. Now, either you
were forced or you weren't.

268
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,990
Okay, I'm bisexual.
Are we done?

269
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,493
No, who shot you?

270
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,228
You're hiding something,
and we're trying to help you.

271
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,392
No. You can't.

272
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:22,028
We take rape
and assault very seriously.

273
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,572
We keep investigating
with or without help.

274
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:28,701
AII right. I was hit
outside the bar, all right?

275
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:31,075
I was knocked on the head,
and the rest is a blur.

276
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:32,170
What do you want from me?

277
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:34,545
Why don't we start
with the truth?

278
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:36,277
There's no evidence
that you were knocked out.

279
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,182
There's no contusions
to the back of your head.

280
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:40,619
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

281
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,589
Any aliases?
No.

282
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:45,718
Your husband's got two names.
You sure you don't
want to amend that?

283
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:50,060
My name is Jaina Jansen,
formerly Jaina Tobias
of Cedar Creek, Arkansas.

284
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,259
Just ask my mother-in-Iaw.

285
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,235
When did you Iast see your
husband before his attack?

286
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,398
That afternoon. He'd gone out
to run some errands,

287
00:13:58,473 --> 00:13:57,304
and when he didn't come back,
I called the police.

288
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,002
They said
I had to wait 48 hours.

289
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:00,669
Which precinct?

290
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,545
You don't believe me?

291
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:06,448
BENSON:
Wesley, it's really hard
admitting that you were raped.

292
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:09,009
You feel guilt.
You feel shame.

293
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:14,448
But you've gotta deal with it,
for yourself
and for your family.

294
00:14:15,827 --> 00:14:18,261
Okay, I will.
Is the Iecture over?

295
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:22,767
No. What was in the envelope
Willem Mueller
passed you in the bar?

296
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,893
Payments for working
on Ray Borland's house.

297
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,631
AII of it in cash?
Yeah.

298
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,297
How much?

299
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:30,773
$4,500, which was stolen
when I got mugged.

300
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:33,208
That's an awful Iot of cash.
Must've been a big job.

301
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,044
Do a Iot of construction
with that bum
right hand of yours?

302
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:38,446
My other one works just fine.

303
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:41,076
Then, why use an alias,
Peter Ivanhoe?

304
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,611
I don't know. I made it up
when Jaina and I ran away.

305
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:47,351
I thought my parents would be
Iooking. I just got
in the habit of using it.

306
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:48,722
Well, what about
Jaina's parents?

307
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:52,889
They're dead. Her father
killed her mother in front
of her and then offed himself.

308
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:55,524
Nobody Iooked out
for her except for me.

309
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,399
Maybe you knew your hubby
was making a drug deal

310
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,529
and you don't call that
into the police.

311
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:02,038
Oh, my God.

312
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:04,371
You've got Wesley involved
with drugs?

313
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,103
No, I don't,

314
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:08,202
but it's just Iike you
to blame me for this.

315
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,180
He never gave us any trouble
until he met you.

316
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:13,877
Yeah, I suppose I seduced him,
too. Got pregnant on purpose
so he'd marry me.

317
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:16,079
I wouldn't put it
past a slut Iike you.

318
00:15:16,154 --> 00:15:18,452
MUNCH: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now cut it out, you two.
Wesley Ioves me!

319
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:21,458
Ms. Jansen, wait in
the Captain's office or Ieave.

320
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:23,551
You park it and chill out.

321
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:26,990
What the hell is going on?

322
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:30,796
That Iady called Mommy a slut.
What does that mean?

323
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,730
Wesley.

324
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,740
CHESTER: Son, wait.
Let's go.

325
00:15:38,343 --> 00:15:39,935
What...
Wesley.

326
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:52,282
Well, that was a hell
of a family reunion.

327
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:55,326
I had a mother-in-Iaw
Iike that, I just might take
a swing at her myself.

328
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,953
We checked with Cedar Creek PD
about the murder-suicide.

329
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,621
Jaina was 10
when it went down.

330
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,895
She moved in with an aunt
whose boyfriend
sexually assaulted her.

331
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,903
The parents said
that Wesley's always had
a soft spot for Jaina.

332
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,734
He even tried to get
his parents to take her in.

333
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:09,398
Let me guess, they passed.

334
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:13,638
After that, he went from
college-bound to truant.
It became all about Jaina.

335
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:16,545
Mara's seven years old,
so Jaina ran
when she was pregnant.

336
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:20,448
To a city where the predators
know a victim
when they see one.

337
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:23,343
But where are we on the rape?

338
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:26,390
Without a complaining witness,
it doesn't exist.

339
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,426
I don't know why
this guy is holding back.

340
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:31,121
But being this scared,
he knows his attackers.

341
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:34,859
Still got attempted murder,
unless you want to
hand it off.

342
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,633
Have I ever?

343
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,366
AII right, here's what we got.

344
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:42,338
Borland claimed that
he didn't know Wesley
when we showed him his photo,

345
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:45,604
but Wesley was paid by Mueller
for Borland's
alleged home repairs.

346
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,042
It's got to be
a drug connection.

347
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:49,546
Well, Iean on Borland.
We'II get an explanation.

348
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:51,878
Lab report says
Mueller's DNA is a match.

349
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,077
Any takers on Borland
matching, too?

350
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:57,713
We can't get a warrant
for his DNA
unless Mueller gives him up.

351
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,848
STABLER:
Let's bring them both in.

352
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:02,324
My client is willing to
cooperate fully.

353
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:06,160
But if the questions
go outside the scope,
I'II bury you in paper.

354
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:10,167
Well, we dream in triplicate,
so Iet's cut
the chest-thumping.

355
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:13,261
Wesley Jansen says
that he works for you.
We're acquaintances.

356
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:15,499
Then why'd you Iie to us
when you said
you didn't know him?

357
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:18,633
Most people don't want
to get involved.
I'm no different.

358
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,543
Sodomy in the First, along
with his convict history.

359
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:24,309
What do you think, Munch,
18 to 25?

360
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:26,850
Minimum.
I didn't rape anyone.

361
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:29,352
We're not allowed
to talk to you.
You asked for a Iawyer.

362
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:33,016
This is a no-brainer
with the DNA match
in Wesley Jansen.

363
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:35,821
Damn, I hope the perp
can do this kind of time.

364
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:38,863
He wouldn't have to
if he cooperated.
The D.A. Iikes to make deals.

365
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,694
What kind of work
did Wesley Jansen do for you?

366
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,427
Odd jobs,

367
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:47,267
You lied to us
about knowing him,
and you're lying right now,

368
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:50,205
He was gang-raped
by three men,

369
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:53,301
and we've ID'd one of his
attackers as your Iive-in,
Willem Mueller.

370
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:54,845
That's it. Interview's over.

371
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:57,541
What are the odds
the DNA sample from you
will match the evidence?

372
00:17:57,615 --> 00:17:59,640
Get a court order,
otherwise hold your breath.

373
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:01,742
Mueller's facing
some pretty serious time,

374
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,483
so he's across the hall,
probably giving you up
right now.

375
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:08,185
There's nothing he can say
to incriminate me.

376
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:12,294
So, where you think
he'll do his time,
Dannemora or Sing Sing?

377
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:15,389
$100 on the big house
in Ossining,
He's got old friends up there,

378
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,025
You got to show me
the cash first,

379
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:20,594
We were making a movie.
Nobody got raped.

380
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:22,799
You can't talk to us
without your Iawyer.

381
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:25,934
I'II sign a release
if it'II get me out of here.

382
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:28,874
Hancock the bottom.

383
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:30,209
What kind of movie?

384
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:33,445
Gay porn.

385
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:36,978
I produce films.

386
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:40,218
I sent Willem Mueller
to pay Wesley
for his services.

387
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,350
One of the best group scenes
we've ever shot.

388
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:43,621
And why should
we believe that?

389
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:45,663
Well, I could screen
the film for you,
if you'd Iike.

390
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,527
So, Wesley's one of your
gay porn stars?

391
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,999
Don't be ridiculous.
He's not gay.

392
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:53,595
Gay-on-straight
sells a Iot of videos,
especially if it's bareback.

393
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:57,505
Wesley's strictly gay-for-pay
at 1,500 bucks a bang.

394
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:00,000
Well, now we know
why Wesley wasn't cooperating.

395
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,670
He didn't want us
digging into his background.

396
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,680
He's either ashamed
or he's afraid of somebody.

397
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:06,774
A straight guy wouldn't
want the world to know
he's doing gay porn.

398
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:08,375
Maybe he's in trouble
with the mob.

399
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:11,422
Porn is a multi-billion dollar
mom-and-pop industry now.

400
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:13,184
The mob got out of it
a Iong time ago.

401
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:15,886
And wise guys never walk away
from that much cheddar.

402
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,758
Your victim was shot
in the gut,
not in the heart or the head.

403
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,731
That is a slow, painful
way to die. The motive's
got to be personal.

404
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,701
You think it's a jealous
gay costar who bought
into the make-believe?

405
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,466
If it is a criminal element,
we can offer
Wesley protection.

406
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,670
Just remind him, whoever
shot him could come back
for another try.

407
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:39,376
Excuse me,
we're Iooking for the Jansens.
No one's answering their door.

408
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,045
Is he dead? I called
the ambulance. They got here
pretty quick, considering.

409
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:45,589
What happened?
I didn't mind
Iooking in on Wesley,

410
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:48,751
but the second time I went up,
he was out cold,
so I called 911.

411
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:50,885
Do you know which hospital?

412
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:53,522
Probably St. Martin's.
You know, no insurance.

413
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:54,587
Where's Jaina?

414
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,724
Well, she had to work.

415
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,290
She Ieft me this number.
I called her.

416
00:19:57,368 --> 00:20:01,862
It was some management
company, and they said
they'd give her the message.

417
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:06,938
STABLER:
Pornography isn't illegal.
Making it isn't illegal.

418
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:09,036
Now is there some reason
you neglected to tell us?

419
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:10,171
It's none of your business.

420
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:11,476
Who shot you, Wesley?

421
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,050
I told you I wasn't raped.
I told you I wasn't gay.

422
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,314
So, why won't you believe me
when I say I don't know?

423
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:21,222
Because our experience
has been someone Iies once,
they make it a bad habit.

424
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:24,989
I didn't Iie.
Okay, omitting the truth
is the same thing.

425
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:27,861
I see the way you're
Iooking at me.

426
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:32,369
I'm scum because I make money
having sex. So, why do you
care who shot me?

427
00:20:33,137 --> 00:20:34,934
Because it's our job.

428
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:38,130
I got nothing else to say.

429
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:42,305
Look, if somebody's after you,
then no one in your family
is safe.

430
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:45,547
Where's your wife?
You Ieave her out of this.

431
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:46,709
BENSON: Either you tell us
where she is,

432
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:48,877
or we will find your wife
and find out
how much she knows.

433
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:51,649
PIease don't involve Jaina.
You don't understand
what you're doing.

434
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:56,217
Then you start explaining
to us, because we're
running out of options here.

435
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:13,100
May I help you?

436
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,511
Jaina Jansen.

437
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:18,071
She in some kind of trouble?

438
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:22,480
If you could just wait,
I'II Iet them know
back there...

439
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:25,488
OMAN: Come on, Jaina. That's
it, honey. That's it, good.
Pick up the pace a Iittle.

440
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:29,287
Joey, just kneel down behind
her. AII right. A Iittle more
to the Ieft. Good. Good.

441
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,691
(STABLER WHISTLES)

442
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:32,423
What are you doing here?

443
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:34,488
You ruined my shot.
Who are you?

444
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:36,032
Police.
We need to talk to Jaina.

445
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,567
AII right, no, no, no,
everybody just relax.

446
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:39,466
We're not doing anything
illegal here, okay.

447
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:41,027
I'm Cal Oman,
the director of this film,

448
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,470
and I assure you
everything's in order.

449
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,804
Look, this isn't about you.
Can we do this Iater, please?

450
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,174
No, Jaina, you need to
get dressed,
because we need to talk.

451
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:50,009
Well, actually, she doesn't
have to, because
she's not under arrest.

452
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:51,446
We're making a movie here.
Time is money.

453
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:53,381
AII right,
stand over there, please.

454
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:55,043
Now, you know that Wesley's
back in the hospital?

455
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,143
Yeah, he called.

456
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,656
I was going to call him
back on my break. Is he okay?

457
00:22:00,124 --> 00:22:01,352
He's fine.

458
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:08,097
Look, if I don't work,
I don't get paid,
and we need this money.

459
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,327
Look, am I gonna
have to call a Iawyer?
Give me the phone.

460
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:12,835
Why don't you call two?
They'II both tell you
to stay out of it.

461
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:15,395
Look, get a warrant
or get Iost. AII right?

462
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,304
This is my building,
and I don't want you here.

463
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,673
Mommy, can I have quarters
for the soda machine?

464
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:22,804
Jaina, I'm sorry.
I tried to get her,
but I couldn't stop her.

465
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,316
What in the hell
is your daughter
doing on a porn set?

466
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:34,089
Can I see my daughter, please?
She needs me.

467
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:36,023
You couldn't find
a baby-sitter?

468
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:37,288
No.

469
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:39,421
Wesley's sick.
I had to take her with me.

470
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:42,193
What about your in-Iaws?
Why not ask them?

471
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:44,666
So they can teach her
to hate me?

472
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,370
Besides, nobody
can take care of Mara
except me and Wes.

473
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,067
Yeah? Why's that?

474
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:52,609
I need to get her home.

475
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:56,010
You're not going anywhere,
and neither is Mara.

476
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,048
I didn't do anything wrong.

477
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:59,641
We're charging you
with child endangerment.

478
00:22:59,718 --> 00:23:01,185
You took your daughter
to a porn set.

479
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:04,086
It's not exactly a healthy
and safe environment for kids.

480
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:08,718
PIease, don't do this.
If I go to jail,
who takes care of Mara?

481
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:12,061
Either Children's Services
or your in-Iaws.

482
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:15,356
She has cystic fibrosis.

483
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:21,365
She needs constant care.
I'm doing the best that I can.

484
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:25,773
There's doctor visits
and shots, pills.

485
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:29,678
Wesley's the only one
that knows how
to do her chest therapy,

486
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:32,683
and somebody has to
bring in a paycheck.

487
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:34,582
Okay, we'II consider
putting you on notice.

488
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:38,953
That means Children's Services
will check in on you
from time to time.

489
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:41,557
What's the catch?

490
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:46,530
Well, it's pretty obvious that
Wesley doesn't care about
his own well-being. Do you?

491
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:52,494
I can't help you.

492
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:55,438
Jaina, somebody tried
to kill your husband.

493
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:59,576
You cooperate with us,
and you can walk
out that door.

494
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:05,379
You're gonna have to
arrest me.

495
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,093
We threaten to take her kid,
and she still won't talk.

496
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:18,186
It's not a threat.
She endangered a child.

497
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:19,992
That's enough to remove
a minor from her care.

498
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:21,794
Jaina is obviously terrified.

499
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:25,030
If the mob is connected,
we're just adding
more pressure.

500
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:26,468
And the daughter's terminal.

501
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:28,870
I don't want to put
a sick child
with Children's Services.

502
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:30,465
Can't the grandparents
take custody?

503
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,373
Well, that's not gonna help
Wesley and Jaina.

504
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:35,379
Somebody's squeezing them
to keep quiet, but aren't we
just doing the same thing?

505
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:36,436
They're jerking us around.

506
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:38,813
If we have to force them
to cooperate,
I'm fine with that.

507
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:43,082
Yeah, Wesley got very agitated
when we told him
we were going to Jaina.

508
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:46,818
Maybe she's been
the target all along,
and he just got in the middle.

509
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:50,555
If we're thinking mob,
check into this pornographer,
Cal Oman,

510
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:52,756
see if he's a connected guy.

511
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:55,899
Ten minutes, then I gotta
block the next shot.

512
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:59,426
Vice gave us an earful about
you. Lots of charges
from extortion to blackmail.

513
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:01,666
Lots of trumped-up charges,
but no convictions.

514
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,935
Yet.
You ever thought about
doing a movie?

515
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:06,569
You Iook Iike
you'd be a real natural.
You still work for
the Santuccis?

516
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:09,205
Having friends
from the old neighborhood
is not a criminal offense.

517
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,578
I am a filmmaker, not a hood.

518
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:12,310
Who finances those movies?

519
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:14,818
Look, why don't you just quit
fishing and get to the point?

520
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:18,084
Okay, you're pretty small
potatoes in the porn industry.

521
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:21,421
Jaina Jansen's
your only big star.
Yeah.

522
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:23,688
STABLER: For such a big draw,
she doesn't work that much.

523
00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:25,423
Her husband get in the way?

524
00:25:25,497 --> 00:25:27,294
The Iess she works,
the more the public wants her.

525
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:30,529
Wesley moonlighting, I mean,
that must've pissed you off.

526
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:32,297
Why? I don't use him
that much,

527
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:34,931
and now with
the bareback-riding thing,
I won't use him at all.

528
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:36,838
Yeah, but married couples
don't use condoms,

529
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:38,672
so he's putting your star
at risk.

530
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:41,508
You know, if Jaina wants
to play Russian roulette,
that's her business.

531
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,605
I made her a star. I can make
another one just Iike her.

532
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,775
Yeah,
but wouldn't it be easier
just to get rid of Wesley?

533
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:47,842
Look, I hate to disappoint
you, but I didn't shoot
the bastard.

534
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,320
Okay, so, where were you
that night?
Right here. Prepping a movie.

535
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:51,788
Who were you with?

536
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:54,849
I was rehearsing one of
the new girls, Delia Sarton.

537
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:57,521
Just Iike I used to with Jaina
in the old days.

538
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:58,927
You and Jaina were involved?

539
00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:00,430
Long time ago,
but I've moved on.

540
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:01,693
Jaina's got mileage.

541
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,701
Who wants to be with a chick
that's been with
a hundred guys?

542
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,169
So, where can we find
Delia Sarton?

543
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:10,470
She's getting a body wax.
My receptionist
will tell you where she is.

544
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:15,479
Hi.
Hi, Delia Sarton?

545
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:18,949
Yeah, that's me.
Cal said you wanted
to ask me questions.

546
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,951
Yeah. Did he mention why?

547
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:24,318
No, he didn't tell me
what to say,
if that's what you mean.

548
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,687
Where were you two nights ago?

549
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:29,522
From 8:30 to 1:00,
I was with Cal on set.

550
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:30,960
Do you always rehearse
that Iate?

551
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,053
AII the time.

552
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,826
How'd you get home?
I took a cab.

553
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,663
What cab company?

554
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:37,929
It was yellow.

555
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,503
What'd you do
before you went to rehearsal?

556
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,739
Who were you with?
Where'd you go?

557
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,868
I don't remember.

558
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:48,412
Did you know that
you can be charged
with obstruction of justice,

559
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,712
giving a false statement to
a police officer and perjury,
if this goes to trial?

560
00:26:52,784 --> 00:26:56,083
Sixteen months to three years
in Bedford Hills prison.

561
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:59,055
Delia, do you want
to change your statement?

562
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,051
I didn't mean...

563
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:08,021
I just want to be a star
Iike Jaina. Cal gives her
all the best parts.

564
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,399
Is that what he promised you
if you vouched for him?

565
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,975
He set up a gang-bang
for Jaina in Vegas.
300 guys in 10 hours.

566
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:21,501
She's gonna be
on Howard Stern.
Cal's crazy about her.

567
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,275
What do you mean, crazy?

568
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:25,248
He says she belongs to him.

569
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:29,982
PIease don't tell on me.
If Cal finds out...
Don't worry.

570
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:40,497
"File no 745243.
People v, Jaina Jansen,

571
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:42,055
"One count,
child endangerment.

572
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:44,125
"One count, unlawful dealing
with a child."

573
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:48,969
Objection. Unlawful dealing
covers minors in bars,
obscenities and prostitution.

574
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,440
That isn't the case here.

575
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,670
Pornography is a form
of Iegal prostitution.

576
00:27:52,744 --> 00:27:55,941
The minor's physical,
mental and emotional welfare
was corrupted.

577
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:58,244
I agree. How do you plead,
Mr. Schoenfeld?

578
00:27:58,316 --> 00:28:00,682
Not guilty and request ROR.

579
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:02,276
The defendant
is a porn actress.

580
00:28:02,354 --> 00:28:06,552
She took her daughter to work,
exposing her to an environment
of wanton sexual activity.

581
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:10,356
The minor child was confined
to an area where all members
of the cast are clothed.

582
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:12,329
My client did everything
to shield her daughter.

583
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:13,762
CABOT: Except to
get a baby-sitter.

584
00:28:13,832 --> 00:28:16,164
The defendant's in-Iaws were
in town and were never called.

585
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:18,464
SCHOENFELD: The Iittle girl
suffers from cystic fibrosis.

586
00:28:18,537 --> 00:28:20,698
She can't be Ieft
in the care of just anyone.

587
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:22,330
Then your client
should have thought of that

588
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:25,467
before she took an
innocent child to a porn set.

589
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:28,873
Your client has endangered
the welfare of a minor.

590
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:32,678
For the privilege
of her freedom,
I want $5,000, cash or bond.

591
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:34,218
Next case.

592
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:36,777
CLERK:
"Docket number 28763..."

593
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:43,185
We know Cal's connected
and we know he's got
a thing for your wife.

594
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:45,559
He tried to kill you.
Next time you're not
gonna be so Iucky.

595
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,860
Next time it might be
your daughter.

596
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,491
But maybe that's
what you want, huh?

597
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:53,129
I mean, you must be awful
tired of being saddled
with a sick kid.

598
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:55,402
You just calm down. Calm down.
AII right.

599
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:59,741
Now, you've just assaulted
a police officer
and I'm gonna frisk you,

600
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:03,743
just in case any of Cal's
friends are hanging around.

601
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:06,250
And then I'm gonna arrest you
unless you start
talking to us.

602
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,685
If I say anything,
Mara gets hurt
and I can't risk it.

603
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:12,350
Then give us your statement
so we can put Cal Oman away.

604
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:13,585
We can protect you.

605
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:14,921
No, you can't.

606
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:17,356
Jaina already tried to Ieave.

607
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,694
He said that he made her
and that she wasn't
going anywhere.

608
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:21,233
So he shot you
to prove it to her?

609
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,427
We never thought
he'd go that far.

610
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:25,833
He would've killed me
if that homeless guy
hadn't shown up.

611
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:28,135
So, stand up and say that.

612
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:31,973
My daughter is dying.
We do porn to pay
for her bills.

613
00:29:32,044 --> 00:29:36,208
Do you understand that?
There is nothing
that I wouldn't do for her.

614
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:39,178
I'm going to bail my wife out.

615
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:43,052
If you keep coming after us,
you're just gonna
make it worse.

616
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,602
He's boxed in pretty tight.

617
00:29:57,303 --> 00:29:59,464
Since Cal Oman
Iied about his alibi,

618
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,598
maybe we should bring him in
and do a Iittle two-on-one.

619
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,165
Well, it sounds Iike fun,
but that'II give him
a heads-up

620
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:08,043
and too much time to be
working out another
explanation with his friends.

621
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:10,810
Okay, so we pull our witness
in and do a Iineup.

622
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:14,717
He IDs Oman, we Iock him down,
with no way out.

623
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:18,448
That's if Munch
and Fin can still Iocate Phil.

624
00:30:19,492 --> 00:30:21,824
What a surprise,
Phil's back in rehab.

625
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:23,156
His ID won't be any good.

626
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:24,457
That's for Cabot to decide.

627
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,158
It's a waste of time. What?

628
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:29,565
Don't you think you're taking
Phil's relapse too personally?

629
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:31,796
He's jeopardizing the case
and making my job harder.

630
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,361
I always take that personally.

631
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,964
Early on,
I had a partner Iike you
used to get worked up.

632
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,340
What happened?
He ate his gun.

633
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:41,442
I need you to focus, Phil.
I've got some pictures
you need to see.

634
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:43,607
Okay. I'm hurting bad.

635
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,817
We need you to identify
the guy you saw
do the shooting.

636
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:50,550
What shooting?

637
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:52,090
That's it.
I think we're done here.

638
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:54,183
Where's the fire, AIex?
We need this.

639
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,696
Is it against the rules
to remind him of the incident?

640
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:03,096
Jog his memory about what he
went through and nothing else.

641
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:09,431
How'd you get that scratch
on your face, Phil?

642
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,377
It hurts.

643
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:16,245
Phil, you wanna be a stupid
dick and kill yourself,
you go right ahead.

644
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:19,148
I need you to Iook
at these damn pictures.

645
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,886
You gave me orange juice.
You're a nice guy.

646
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:29,826
Yeah, I'm a nice guy.
Look at the pictures.
You see anybody?

647
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:38,564
Brunette. Snub-nose revolver.

648
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:45,971
I can't take these to a judge.
Your witness
is coming off of heroin.

649
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:47,410
He was clean
during his statement.

650
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,506
We got a tox screen,
thanks to my partner,
so we're covered.

651
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,050
Can't you call in a favor?

652
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,747
After working with this unit
I don't have that many Ieft.

653
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:58,554
Move! Move!

654
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:03,788
COP 1: CIear.

655
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,526
COP 2: CIear.

656
00:32:12,405 --> 00:32:13,929
It's Cal Oman.

657
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:18,768
Okay. Get me an evidence bag.
I want Prints and Ballistics
on this.

658
00:32:18,844 --> 00:32:21,039
Tell the Iab. Make it a rush.

659
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:26,249
Entry wound's through
the back. He was running away.

660
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,380
Well, that tends to happen
when you're facing
the barrel of a gun.

661
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:37,291
AII right, take it easy.
We got a sick child in there.

662
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:44,369
COP 1: CIear.
CIear.

663
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:45,631
COP 2: CIear.

664
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:47,799
They're running.

665
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:49,704
With Wesley's prints
all over the murder weapon,

666
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:51,766
this goes out citywide,
he becomes a mark.

667
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,404
Well, they're broke,
so they can't get that far.

668
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,041
We know where his parents
are staying. Let's go alone.

669
00:33:02,155 --> 00:33:03,850
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

670
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:06,950
My son didn't do this.

671
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,654
WESLEY: Mom, you have to do
this three times a day, okay?

672
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:11,027
She will whine.
She'II say it hurts.
You can't Iet that stop you.

673
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:13,157
She will die if you don't.
Say you understand.

674
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:14,894
I understand.
On your feet, Wesley.

675
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:17,562
PIease. Just give me a second,
please?

676
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:20,364
There's six positions.
Chest, back,
both sides, all right?

677
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,772
Five minutes each.
Try to make her cough after.

678
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:25,778
If she gets a fever,
call her doctor,
Dr. Lawrence Baylord.

679
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:28,246
That's her pulmonologist.
See she takes pancreatic
enzymes also.

680
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:30,044
Don't worry.
I'II take good care of her.

681
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:33,211
(CRYING) Don't go.
Sweetie, sweetie.
AII right, Iisten.

682
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:35,811
Grandma's going to finish,
because I have to go
with the police.

683
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,618
Daddy, please!
Okay, we're not gonna cuff you

684
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:40,251
in front of her, but you
have to come with us now.

685
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:41,760
I Iove you, honey.
Wesley.

686
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:44,160
It'II be okay.
PIease don't go.

687
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,790
(MARA CRYING)

688
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:50,030
Come on, Mara, be a good girl.
PIease, Daddy, don't go!

689
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:52,302
PIease.
Daddy, I'm gonna miss you.

690
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:54,101
You have the right
to remain silent.

691
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:56,301
You have the right...
Daddy, please!

692
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:57,536
Daddy!

693
00:33:58,478 --> 00:33:59,809
(COUGHING)

694
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:01,975
Daddy!

695
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:09,010
My parents took out a second
mortgage on their house
for Mara.

696
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:13,116
She's on the transplant Iist.
She's gonna be
in the hospital for awhile.

697
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:14,785
Jaina didn't need to do
the gang-bang anymore.

698
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:18,422
So, I just went over there,
and I tried to reason
with Cal.

699
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,022
Reason with the man
who shot you?

700
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,466
It sounds more Iike
a motive for murder to me.

701
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,766
Well, that's not true. I mean,

702
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,604
I'm in enough trouble
as it is,
why would I need to Iie?

703
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:31,576
Because it's the difference
between parole
and a Iife sentence.

704
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:35,037
I didn't mean to kill him.

705
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:39,017
We fought,
and he pulled the gun,
and we struggled with it,

706
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,781
and it went off.

707
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:43,049
Are you claiming self-defense?

708
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,853
Yeah. Well, yeah.
That's how it happened.

709
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:49,385
Well, the evidence doesn't
support your story.

710
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:51,731
There were no signs
of a struggle in that room.

711
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,734
And if it went down Iike
you say, the prints on the gun
would be smudged.

712
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:03,574
Where's Jaina?

713
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,634
She's taking care
of a few things.

714
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:10,879
She's moving back to Arkansas
with my parents.
She's gonna Iive there.

715
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:16,450
Okay.
You need to change your story,
and you need to do it now,

716
00:35:16,523 --> 00:35:19,515
because once we walk out
this room, we're gonna
recommend to the prosecution

717
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:21,254
that they go for the maximum.

718
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:25,162
But if you tell us the truth,
we will try
to get you Ieniency.

719
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,803
Our phone was ringing
off the hook.

720
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,797
Guys were calling
from L.A. and Vegas.

721
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:39,568
They wanted to sign her up
for bigger and better stunts.

722
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:43,514
You know, just Iining up
to turn her into
a sideshow freak.

723
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,210
So, you shot him?

724
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,719
I just wanted her out.
I didn't mean for him to die.

725

"File number 565429.

00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:04,563
How do you plead?

00:36:04,638 --> 00:36:05,832
I'm guilty, Your Honor.

729

The defendant confessed to SVU
detectives and signed
his own statement.

We're satisfied
with the facts.

Look, is there anything
you can do for my son?

735
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:30,819
Mr. Jansen, your son
has confessed to homicide.

736
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,127
There's nothing...
It's completely
out of our hands.

737
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,065
You know,
it's just not in him.

738
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:36,227
STABLER: Well,
with all due respect, sir,

739
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:38,396
you haven't seen your son
in a number of years.

740
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:40,666
I know my son didn't do this.

741
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:43,135
This is her fault.

742
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,736
You keep blaming Jaina
for Wesley's bad judgment.

743
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:50,544
Well, where the hell is she?
She told us she's not
going back to Arkansas.

744
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:53,609
Wesley's going through hell.
She's nowhere to be found.

745
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:55,177
Is Mara going with her?

746
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,155
Mara's going to Iive with us.

747
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:00,020
Well,
even if we wanted to help,

748
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:04,052
the preliminary Iab report
shows your son's prints
on the murder weapon.

749
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:08,165
I know people change,
but my son
didn't shoot anyone.

750
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:11,395
I hunt. I have rifles.

751
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:14,996
Wesley, he never touched them.

752
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:17,202
Never.

753
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:24,139
Did you find any other prints
besides our perp's?

754
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:26,447
None. No smudges
and no partials,

755
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,419
but I did find prints
belonging to the victim

756
00:37:28,488 --> 00:37:30,319
on the other rounds
inside the weapon.

757
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,585
That doesn't make any sense
unless you wiped it clean.

758
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,388
Can you tell us which hands
made the prints?

759
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,792
His right.

760
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:39,523
That's a tight trigger.

761
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,227
Wesley doesn't have the
dexterity to fire that gun.

762
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,395
So, why did he wipe it off
and put his prints
all over it?

763
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,167
Who has he been protecting
from day one?

764
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:51,907
You Ieaving?
I've got a bus to catch.

765
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,139
You weren't in court today.

766
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:55,647
I just couldn't deal with it.

767
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:58,513
Your husband's going
to prison. Don't you care?

768
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:00,212
Of course I care,

769
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:05,147
but I have to accept it
and deal with reality.

770
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,093
I gotta start over.

771
00:38:08,962 --> 00:38:11,487
They have porn in Arkansas,
or are you just giving it up?

772
00:38:11,564 --> 00:38:14,658
Porn isn't what you think.
A Iot of it's fake.

773
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,326
And there's no way
I'm going back

774
00:38:16,403 --> 00:38:19,463
to where small town people
with small minds judge me.

775
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:21,234
So, where are you headed?

776
00:38:21,308 --> 00:38:23,037
Vegas, then L.A.

777
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,140
It's my Iast chance.
I really need this.

778
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:27,440
If I'm not a star
before I'm 30,

779
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,506
I can forget about
being a producer,
a director Iater on.

780
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:32,574
What about your daughter?

781
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,220
She's gonna stay
with my in-Iaws.

782
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:40,592
I'II make enough money
and send it back
till I get a nice place,

783
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,254
and I'm gonna hire
the best Iawyer for Wes.

784
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,820
So, you get to be
the porn queen

785
00:38:44,898 --> 00:38:48,800
while your husband takes
the fall for a crime
he didn't commit?

786
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,895
You think he's innocent?

787
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:53,997
The evidence proves
that he is.

788
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:57,608
Thank God.

789
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:00,604
When's he getting out?

790
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:03,411
Why don't we go inside
and talk about it?

791
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:05,577
Yeah, Iet's go back inside.

792
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:10,822
Have you fired a gun recently?
No.

793
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:13,325
Then you'II agree
to a gun shot residue test.

794
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:14,418
Why?

795
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:17,157
If we find traces of gunpowder
on your skin
or on your clothes,

796
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,062
you're gonna need to
explain that to a judge.

797
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:22,125
Gunpowder doesn't wash off
right away, so if there
are traces, we can find it.

798
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:25,104
We're gonna need
the clothes you were wearing
the day Cal Oman was shot.

799
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:28,198
So, are they in this bag here
or on the floor?

800
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,873
This isn't happening.

801
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:36,713
The court will probably go
easy on you.
Terminally ill child.

802
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:40,181
You were a minor
who was coerced
into child pornography.

803
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:41,744
There won't be a dry eye
in the house.

804
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:43,153
We know you shot Cal Oman.

805
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:46,785
We just have to get you
to the Iab,
and we can prove it.

806
00:39:55,236 --> 00:39:58,603
He slapped me around.
He threatened me.

807
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:02,234
I had to shoot him.

808
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:04,539
He was shot in the back,
Jaina, trying to escape.

809
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:07,843
You didn't know him.
I had to defend myself.

810
00:40:08,382 --> 00:40:10,976
So, then you Iet Wesley
make the sacrifice.

811
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:14,915
I was a wreck.
I told him what happened.

812
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:19,790
And I didn't ask him to,
but he knows Mara needs me.

813
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,226
But you're not going
to Arkansas to be with her.

814
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:25,129
You're Ieaving your child
with her grandparents.

815
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:32,402
You don't understand
what it is Iike
to be trapped with a sick kid,

816
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:36,034
doing three guys at a time
to pay off my debts.

817
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:42,441
I have a $50,000 contract
waiting for me in Las Vegas.

818
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:44,950
And Cal would've
taken all of it.

819
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:48,352
He was never gonna Iet me go.

820
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:54,521
Well, neither will
Bedford Hills. At Ieast
not for 15 years minimum.

821
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:14,243
What happens to Jaina now?

822
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:17,944
Your wife's pled not guilty.
She's going for self-defense.

823
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,549
What are her chances?

824
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:21,747
Doesn't Iook good.
