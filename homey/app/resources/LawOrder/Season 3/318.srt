00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:00,231
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:04,000
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:05,131
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:08,177
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:11,771
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,816
These are their stories,

7
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:20,620
Hey, Sammy.

8
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:24,816
Long time no see.
It's good to see you.
GIad you called.

9
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:27,856
Something happened.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,625
Yeah, what's that?

11
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:33,258
Bad.

12
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:34,769
Tell me.

13
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:39,735
My mom...
I think she knows.

14
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:44,139
What makes you
think that?

15
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:46,181
She keeps asking me
questions.

16
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:47,443
Did you say anything?

17
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:48,882
No, but she's all
freaked out.

18
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:50,851
Okay. It's all right.

19
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:55,354
This is no big
deal now, okay?
You just gotta be cool.

20
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:59,020
AII right? Just be patient,
just be cool, okay?

21
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:02,326
Just act Iike an adult,
Iike we always talk about.

22
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:06,327
Okay.

23
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:09,462
I don't want to get you
in trouble, man,
you know that.

24
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,572
SAM: Yeah.

25
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:15,805
I want to protect you,
all right?
Yeah.

26
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,045
Right? So if anybody
asks you, what are
you gonna tell them?

27
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:23,785
What do you think
I should say?

28
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:26,481
That's good.
Let him hang himself.

29
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:30,890
We didn't do anything
wrong, Nothing illegal
happened, right?

30
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,488
Uh-huh, Yeah,

31
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:34,996
We're just good friends,

32
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:36,998
He's gotta say
more than that.

33
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:40,900
I told my mom
nothing happened,
She didn't believe me,

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,438
That's all right,
It's just moms,

35
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:44,564
They don't
always understand,

36
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,944
Hey. You okay, buddy?

37
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:54,943
You seem really
stressed out.

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,080
Run.
What?

39
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,182
No.

40
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:04,886
SAM: They're listening, Run!
Pick him up. Pick him up.

41
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,121
Get him outside.
Kid tipped him off.

42
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:07,287
Don't Iet him
near the tracks.

43
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:10,457
Barnett, can we have
a word with you, please?

44
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,049
You haven't identified
yourself.

45
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:30,881
But you already know
who we are, don't you, Roy?

46
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:34,354
Don't worry. We're
gonna get real intimate
before you know it.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,684
What the hell
just happened?

48
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,092
The kid warned him.

49
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:43,056
It's okay.
You did good.

50
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,067
But we got
something, right?

51
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:49,036
After all that,
he had to say something
that we can nail him on.

52
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:50,504
Not enough.

53
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:45,691
BARNETT ON TAPE: We didn't
do anything wrong, Nothing
illegal happened, right?

54
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:46,853
Nothing illegal.

55
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,955
Unless we're talking about
Iaw enforcement using
a child to entrap my client.

56
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:53,126
BENSON: Entrapment. How many
times do we hear that word
when we record conversations?

57
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:54,191
Every time.

58
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,602
Don't Iet your Iawyer
fool you, Mr. Barnett.

59
00:03:56,672 --> 00:03:58,401
No judge is going to
throw that tape out.

60
00:03:58,474 --> 00:04:00,601
Every word you said
is evidence against you.

61
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:03,474
Against him? AII he said was
he didn't do anything wrong.

62
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:05,275
You tried to coerce
your victim to Iie.

63
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:08,715
You... Wow,
you must have super powers.
I didn't hear any of that.

64
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:09,876
STABLER:
You know what I heard?

65
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:12,921
For four years, you've been
taking Sam Cavanaugh
to your apartment

66
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,923
and forcing him
to perform sex acts.

67
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:16,015
That isn't true.

68
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:17,719
Hey, pal, according
to Sam it is.

69
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:21,285
Look, Sam's a great kid,
but he's very troubled.

70
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:23,355
He makes things up
to see what'II happen.

71
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:26,128
Why does that sound
so familiar?

72
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:28,133
Well, maybe it's because
you used the same excuse

73
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:30,695
in your statement
about another boy in 1985,

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,534
and again in 1990. Now, did
they make that up, too?

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,578
STABLER: You just
make it a habit
of consorting with Iiars.

76
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,045
Those were misunderstandings.

77
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:41,675
But you pled guilty
to coercion and
endangering a child anyway.

78
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:44,311
The world just doesn't
understand men Iike him,

79
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:48,619
who have a deep,
abiding Iove for young boys.

80
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:52,353
You don't have the problem.
We do, right?

81
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:55,056
That's a fascinating glimpse
into your psyche, Detective.

82
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:56,564
If you're going to charge
my client...

83
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,623
Look, can I just
say one thing?

84
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,431
I spend time with Sam
because I Iike him.

85
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:04,064
I feel sorry for him because
he doesn't have a father.

86
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,474
Sometimes boys
just need to talk to a man.

87
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,003
If I'm guilty of anything,

88
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,480
it's of having
an overdeveloped
sense of responsibility.

89
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,847
I consider Sam a friend.

90
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:20,648
I would never do
anything to hurt him.

91
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:22,652
Nice performance.

92
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:25,694
He's been through the system
enough to know exactly
how to sound innocent.

93
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:27,524
Two more minutes and we
would've had everything.

94
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:30,861
There's no guarantee
Barnett would have
incriminated himself on tape,

95
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,298
even if Sam
hadn't told him.

96
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:36,168
That kid worked with us
for over a month.
Why change his mind now?

97
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:38,229
Because part of Sam
still cares for Barnett.

98
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:40,775
But Sam reported Barnett
to the police.

99
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:43,243
No, he didn't.
His mother did.

100
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:44,740
That's an important
distinction.

101
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:48,443
Sam told his mother about
the abuse, but not before
she confronted him.

102
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:53,318
From Sam's manipulated
perspective, he's protecting
the one man who Ioves him.

103
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:58,155
Barnett chooses boys who are
vulnerable, boys who crave
affection and support.

104
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:02,755
They're the easiest victims
to control and the Ieast
Iikely to turn on him.

105
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,367
Whatever Sam's reasons are,
the upshot is,
we've got no case.

106
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:09,404
Well, we've still got
his testimony.
Debatable.

107
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:11,702
He didn't seem
too compelled to testify
the Iast time I saw him...

108
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:13,071
Then we've gotta
compel him.

109
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:14,769
Doc, maybe you can see
where his head's at.

110
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:17,711
No, I don't think
I'm the best choice.
Victims his age are afraid

111
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,408
that because their abuser
is male, they themselves
might be gay.

112
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:23,111
He might perceive my presence
as an accusation.

113
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:25,312
I'II talk to him.
He thinks this is
all his fault.

114
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:29,017
The hardest part is going
to be convincing him
that he's wrong.

115
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,918
AII right, I'II take
the mother into my office.

116
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:33,928
You talk to Sam
in the interview room.

117
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:37,123
CABOT: What we asked
you to do was a
very difficult thing.

118
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,759
I am sorry you had
to go through it.

119
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,061
I want you to know right now,
nobody blames you
for telling him,

120
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,470
all right?

121
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,003
I don't believe you.

122
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,270
Why?

123
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,537
Because I wrecked the whole
thing. I know you're mad.

124
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:54,208
Not at you. I understand
why you wouldn't want to
get Barnett in trouble.

125
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,148
There's nothing wrong
with that.

126
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:57,583
Wrong with what?

127
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:02,751
Caring about
what happens to him,
even if you don't want to.

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,796
Sam, what Roy Barnett did
to you was never your fault.

129
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:11,560
He chose you because
you are young
and he could control you.

130
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,693
When you decide
you want to be with someone,

131
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:17,296
whoever that person is,
it will be your choice.

132
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:19,468
I'm not a fag.

133
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:22,071
I'm not saying...

134
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:23,702
I have a girlfriend.

135
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:26,339
Okay...

136
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,042
I'm not a fag!

137
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:31,382
I don't want to
talk about it anymore!

138
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,783
Sweetheart. Sweetheart,
wait. What is it?

139
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:37,985
I want to go home.

140
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,518
Oh, Sam, come on.
We can talk...
No, I don't want to do this!

141
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:43,155
Mrs. Cavanaugh, I'm sorry...

142
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,029
You said it would be over.

143
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,068
You said nothing
would go wrong.

144
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,160
Nothing went wrong.

145
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,602
We've still got him
in custody.

146
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:54,541
The only reason I came to you
was because I didn't
know what else to do.

147
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,074
He didn't want to
call the police.
HUANG:
You did the right thing.

148
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:59,478
With Sam's help, we could put
Barnett away for a Iong time.

149
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:02,574
We tried to help you.
It didn't work.

150
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,016
You've already
come this far.

151
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:05,110
No.

152
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:10,418
I'm not going to put him
through this again.
We're done.

153
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:15,294
Where's Barnett now?
BENSON: He's processing.

154
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,059
He'II be out on bail
by tomorrow afternoon.

155
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:21,330
Which means we've got until
then to build a case against
him without Sam Cavanaugh.

156
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,200
Any chance on finding
other victims?

157
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:26,799
Barnett's parole included
mandatory therapy
which he allegedly attended.

158
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:29,242
I wonder what
dirty Iittle secrets
he shared with that shrink.

159
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:30,903
CRAGEN: Track down
the therapist. What else?

160
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,845
We've gotta get into
his apartment.

161
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,246
Guys Iike these,
they're collectors.

162
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:37,251
So photos, videos, something
to prove Sam's story.

163
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,583
AIex, I assume we've got
cause for a warrant?

164
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:42,852
PIenty. You'II have it
by the time you get there.

165
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,285
STABLER: So much
for being a collector.

166
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:49,058
This guy doesn't keep
anything about his victims.

167
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:52,157
Well, he collects
every single porno
ever made, though.

168
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:53,929
AII hetero, all adult.

169
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:57,131
Latest video games
with every component
state of the art.

170
00:08:57,206 --> 00:09:01,575
Look at this. Sports stuff,
video games, wide screen TV,
plenty of porn.

171
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:03,373
Are we sensing a theme?

172
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:05,072
Yeah, it's a teenage boy's
paradise.

173
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,978
Everything you need
to seduce your next victim.

174
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,641
Boys probably Iike
spending time here

175
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:10,912
'cause it's a Iot more fun
than their own house.

176
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:13,181
But everywhere you turn,
more sex.

177
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,381
Get their motor running,

178
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:15,946
and then just take it
a Iittle bit further
every time.

179
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:17,515
Only one big problem we got.

180
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:19,686
None of this stuff
is incriminating.

181
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:21,320
MAN: Nothing of note
in the bedroom.

182
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:25,128
We'II take the hard drive
down to the Iab. Maybe
they'II have better Iuck.

183
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,296
120 gigabyte hard drive.
119 gigabytes of porn.

184
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,861
So you were
able to access it?

185
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,601
Yeah. But none of it's kids.

186
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,643
You want to see
the Britney Spears collection?

187
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,234
Maybe Iater.
What else did you find?

188
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:37,506
Well, it's what
we didn't find.

189
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,845
Usually the Internet files
are a gold mine,
but not with this guy.

190
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:44,818
He emptied out his cache,
his histories, his Internet
temporary directories.

191
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:47,151
Okay. Service provider?
Doesn't save its records.

192
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:49,486
Well, how the hell
did he have time
to get rid of all that?

193
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,492
He didn't know
we were Iooking at him
until his arrest.

194
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,154
My guess is he clears out
these files daily.

195
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,163
But I thought you guys
could retrieve deleted files.

196
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:59,359
He's got one of those
hard-core scrubber software
on his drive.

197
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:02,131
It's not Department
of Defense grade,
but it's pretty thorough.

198
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:05,401
It writes over
deleted files between
eight and twenty times.

199
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,170
I've been able to extract
a word, and fragments
of an image here and there.

200
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:09,733
So where does that
Ieave us?

201
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,337
Well, give me six months,
$50,000, and an
electron microscope,

202
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:15,713
I might be able to find
something. But I might not.

203
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,286
Pulled Barnett's file
after I got off
the phone with you.

204
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:23,450
Parole board thought
he was the poster boy
for the therapy program.

205
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:24,958
Sounds Iike
you didn't believe that.

206
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,153
Not for a second.

207
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:29,459
Barnett was one of the most
gifted Iiars I've met,
but he was still a Iiar.

208
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:31,294
So is every criminal.
So is my partner,
for that matter.

209
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,800
What makes Barnett so special?

210
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:35,302
Fooled everybody around him
into thinking he was cured.

211
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,430
FIN: Why not you?
Instinct.

212
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,599
Quantify instinct.
I don't.

213
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:41,199
That's good.
Very scientific.

214
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:44,074
I saw it most during
group therapy.

215
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:47,479
Barnett just Ioved
Iistening to his fellow
sex offenders disclose.

216
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,109
Getting his rocks off
while he's supposed to be
getting rehabilitated.

217
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:51,618
He wasn't the only one.

218
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:55,054
Guys Iike him are a big reason
I Ieft the prison system
for teaching.

219
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:56,989
What about Barnett?
Did he disclose?

220
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,254
Part of his behavioral
intervention.

221
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,525
At one point, he admitted
to molesting over 100 boys.

222
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,864
Did he happen to mention
names, dates or places?

223
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,333
Too smart for that.

224
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:13,930
He's far more calculating
than your typical pedophile.

225
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,409
Barnett never chooses
victims of opportunity,

226
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:19,174
Iike children of a girlfriend
or a second wife.

227
00:11:19,248 --> 00:11:23,344
He's a true predator.
Unrepentant, unstoppable.

228
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:26,081
No amount of therapy
will change that.

229
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,992
You're telling me
we've got nothing.

230
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:36,463
CABOT: We have a victim.
Who won't testify.

231
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:37,794
We've got nothing.

232
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,800
Yet. The detectives
can still investigate.

233
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,462
Well, exactly how much
more time and resources

234
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:44,233
would you Iike to waste
on this guy?

235
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:46,001
It's not a waste
if we nail him.

236
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:48,009
Barnett's smart.
He's not going
to make it easy on us.

237
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:52,411
I had your job for 10 years.
None of these guys
are Rhodes Scholars.

238
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:54,506
And in my job,
you pled Barnett down.

239
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,211
Charged with sodomy two,
you Iet him off on coercion.

240
00:11:57,286 --> 00:12:00,312
It was a first offense,
and there was no evidence.

241
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,186
But please,
Iet's compare records

242
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,691
on how many child molesters
we've pled out over the years.

243
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,490
AII I'm saying is,
these cases are never
slam dunks, Liz.

244
00:12:07,563 --> 00:12:10,225
Assuming you can
even find the victims,
they rarely want to testify.

245
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,530
I don't need you
to tell me how the
Special Victims Bureau works.

246
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,934
I haven't been gone
that Iong.

247
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:19,940
The fact is, you had a
slam dunk with Sam Cavanaugh,
and you blew it.

248
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:21,635
I can't force him to testify.

249
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,109
You can try.

250
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:25,169
Barnett is Iet Ioose again,
it Iooks bad for everybody,

251
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:28,216
and the prosecutors
get the brunt of the blame.

252
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:31,616
I remember that from my time
in Special Victims as well.

253
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,882
Don't tell me
that's changed.

254
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:41,123
I don't understand
why you can't just go
to the grand jury

255
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:44,188
and tell them what Sam
told you. They'II believe you.

256
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,496
They need to hear it
from Sam himself.

257
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:49,036
What if I told them
what he told me?

258
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:52,430
That's hearsay,
and the Iaw doesn't allow it.

259
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:55,566
You weren't in Barnett's
apartment with Sam.

260
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:00,441
I wish I was.
Just one time.

261
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:04,509
I could have stopped it.

262
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:07,086
I would have killed him.

263
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:10,250
The only person whose fault
this is is Roy Barnett's.

264
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:13,089
I want to make him pay
for what he did to your son.

265
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:17,394
But if I can't put him
on trial, he is going to keep
doing this to other boys.

266
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,990
I'm sorry, Ms. Cabot, I...

267
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,967
I know how much
you Iove your son.

268
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:25,063
Don't Iet the man
who did this walk away
without being punished.

269
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,744
(SIGHS)

270
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:54,559
I know you
don't want to do this.
I don't want you to either.

271
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,739
And I know
this is my fault.

272
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,140
A Iot of it.

273
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:08,813
And I will never forgive
myself for Ietting
that man come near you.

274
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:12,585
Mom, please.

275
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:23,591
So you tell me
what you want to do.

276
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:27,235
We won't talk
about it again.

277
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:31,207
You want me to tell
this Iady to go, I will.

278
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:37,541
You tell me
what you want to do
and that's what we'II do.

279
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:49,957
I'II do it.
I'II do the trial.

280
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,366
Okay.

281
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:09,006
STABLER:
It's okay if you're nervous.

282
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:19,245
This is the worst part.
Waiting.

283
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,852
The first time
that I testified
in front of all those people,

284
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:28,298
I was so nervous I forgot
the name of the guy
I was testifying against.

285
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:33,330
How many people again?

286
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:36,067
You got 16 jurors,
plus Ms. Cabot.

287
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:39,568
She said Roy
was going to be there.

288
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:43,136
Not while you're testifying.
You never have to see him.

289
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,283
I don't care.

290
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:55,818
So now when you testify
and stuff, it's easy?

291
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:57,327
Not always.

292
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,067
But when you get older,
when you're a man, you gotta
do things that are difficult.

293
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:08,361
Nobody in there believes
this is gonna be easy for you.

294
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:14,169
It takes a Iot of guts.
A Iot of courage.

295
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:20,441
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

296
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:22,452
Okay. We're ready.

297
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:29,790
CABOT: When was
the first time
you remember Mr. Barnett

298
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:33,319
touching you in a way
that made you
feel uncomfortable?

299
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,593
SAM: When I was 12.

300
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:38,866
Do you remember
what happened?

301
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:46,266
I was at Roy's.
I mean, Mr. Barnett's.

302
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,606
We were just hanging out.

303
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,084
He gave me some beer
because I helped him
change the oil in his car.

304
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:58,388
How much did you drink?

305
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,489
I don't... I don't remember.
He just kept getting me some.

306
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,720
Okay.

307
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,922
What happened next?

308
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:13,735
He started
showing me stuff.

309
00:17:14,506 --> 00:17:18,101
Magazines.
Pictures of girls.

310
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,144
Then what happened?

311
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:24,345
He talked about how
guys Iiked to Iook at them

312
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,442
'cause it made them
feel good,

313
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:30,511
and that nothing
was bad about that.

314
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:33,982
What else did he say?

315
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,456
He said that
everybody does it.
That it's no big deal.

316
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:45,762
When he touched you,
what did he say?

317
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,611
Roy said he could
show me how to do it.

318
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,951
He said that
he knew how to do it right
'cause he was older.

319
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:16,427
He said that all guys did it,
and that I could be
a man just Iike him.

320
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:24,901
After Iunch I will present
the rest of the testimony
to the grand jury,

321
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:26,204
and they will deliberate.

322
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:29,644
I don't think
it'II take very Iong
to get an indictment.

323
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:31,443
How'd it go?
Sam did great.

324
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:33,484
MRS. CAVANAUGH: Can we go now?
I'II call you
as soon as we know.

325
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:35,041
You did good.

326
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:37,377
Damn it.

327
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:41,858
Keep walking, dirt bag.

328
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,758
Burn in hell,
you sick son of a bitch!

329
00:18:47,832 --> 00:18:51,165
The bastard ruined my Iife!
Bastard ruined my Iife!

330
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:55,502
You ruined my Iife,
you sick bastard!
I hope you rot in hell!

331
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:58,272
You ruined my Iife!
Sam. Sam...

332
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:00,038
Hold the elevator.

333
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:03,640
You okay?
Yeah.

334
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,480
I thought I was over it.

335
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:14,514
But then I saw him
on the news,
when you arrested him.

336
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:17,687
I saw his face,
and it all came back.

337
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:22,759
I don't even know
what I was trying to do.

338
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,597
When did it happen?

339
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:33,035
It started when I was 1 1.
He coached baseball
after school.

340
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:39,274
Picked out the "special" kids
for extra practice.

341
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:41,712
BENSON: How many were there?
A few.

342
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:46,223
Most of them moved away
or stopped going.

343
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,192
But I kept coming back
for five years.

344
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:52,221
That's why
I never told anybody.

345
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:56,295
Because eventually
you have to admit,
it's your choice, you know?

346
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,391
I could have stopped it...

347
00:19:57,468 --> 00:19:59,629
Tommy, we don't care
if you went back
for 10 years.

348
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:03,265
The second
that he touched you,
he took away your choice.

349
00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:08,345
When I got older, he told me
to not come over anymore.

350
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:11,838
I thought I had done
something wrong.

351
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,976
He just kept telling me
to bring my friends over.

352
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,850
My younger friends.

353
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,647
Whose fault is that?

354
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:20,918
Barnett's.

355
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:24,424
He was the adult,
and you were the child.

356
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:27,521
We're having trouble Iocating
Barnett's other victims.

357
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,363
You remember
any of these boys' names?

358
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:32,769
It was a Iong time ago.

359
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,304
We really need to
talk to them.

360
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,567
The more people
who come forward,
the Ionger he'II be in prison.

361
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:39,041
And I want to press charges
against Barnett.

362
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,840
I'm tired of hiding
from this.

363
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:46,341
How old are you now?
27.

364
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,082
Tommy,

365
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:56,024
unfortunately
the statute of Iimitations
has already expired.

366
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:58,928
The Iaw says that these
crimes have to be reported

367
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:01,659
within five years
of your turning 18.

368
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:05,831
So that's it, then?

369
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:10,605
I waited too Iong,
and he just gets away with it?

370
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:19,047
My client's elected
not to file assault charges
against his attacker.

371
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:22,086
How extremely generous of him,
considering he doesn't
have a scratch on him.

372
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,212
Mr. Barnett would
Iike to discuss a deal.

373
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:26,189
This is getting out of hand.
He'd Iike to put it
behind him.

374
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:28,384
I Iive to make things
easier for your client.

375
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:32,054
Well, we're willing
to consider
custodial interference two.

376
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,188
Consider it?

377
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:36,131
You will consider
a misdemeanor instead of
three felony indictments?

378
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,930
You want to put that boy
through the pain of a trial?

379
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:40,300
This is incredible.

380
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:42,396
Either you're
a complete idiot
or you think I am.

381
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:45,499
AIex, there's gotta be room
for some maneuvering here.

382
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,771
Not this time.
It stops here.

383
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,712
Barnett wants to
put this behind him,
you tell him to plead guilty.

384
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:53,376
It'II save everybody
a Iot of time.

385
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:57,887
You know you've got them when
the defense starts professing
concern about the victim.

386
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:01,413
He is as bad as his client,
hoping the victim
is too traumatized to testify.

387
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:04,825
He's Iucky I didn't knock
his teeth down his throat.

388
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:07,664
I'd pay real money
to see that.

389
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,960
Tommy Priore gave us
a Iist of other boys

390
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:12,628
who were possible victims
of Barnett 15 years ago.

391
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:15,502
Mostly partial, nicknames,
but we'II track them down.

392
00:22:15,573 --> 00:22:17,370
It'II help us establish
a pattern of behavior,

393
00:22:17,442 --> 00:22:19,137
but the statute's probably
expired on all of them.

394
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,871
We're hoping that they'II
Iead us to other boys.

395
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:22,913
Barnett used to Iike
to find his victims
through referral

396
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,504
from whoever
he was molesting at the time.

397
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,743
Sam Cavanaugh
ever refer anybody?

398
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:29,912
Never said. But then again,
he hasn't been
the most forthcoming kid.

399
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:33,980
I'm meeting him in an hour
to go over trial procedure.
I'II ask.

400
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:36,586
Now, the defense attorney's
going to try to confuse you

401
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:39,095
and make it seem Iike
you misunderstood
what happened.

402
00:22:39,163 --> 00:22:42,291
Just answer as honestly
and briefly as possible.

403
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:44,028
You know what I mean?

404
00:22:44,102 --> 00:22:45,763
Yeah, just give
yes or no answers.

405
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:48,670
Very good. Look directly
at him when he's asking
the questions,

406
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,935
and Iook at me
when I'm asking them.

407
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:54,603
Mr. Barnett will be there,
but he can't
say anything to you.

408
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:56,809
How Iong do you think
it'II take?

409
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:58,816
I'II try to make it go
as fast as possible.

410
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:00,374
But as for
the defense attorney...

411
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:02,579
Yeah, just yes or no answers.

412
00:23:02,654 --> 00:23:04,178
You'II do fine.

413
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:12,594
I was thinking about
the other boys Roy knows

414
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:15,326
who maybe aren't
as brave as you are.

415
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:18,403
If we knew who they were,
we could help them.

416
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:22,471
Sam, do you know
if there were any others?

417
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:26,433
I think so.

418
00:23:28,046 --> 00:23:31,982
I didn't know them,
but Roy kept telling me
how I was getting older,

419
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,178
and that pretty soon
I wouldn't need to be
his friend anymore.

420
00:23:35,254 --> 00:23:37,984
I don't really think
he was your friend.

421
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:45,361
I remember this one time,
Roy picked me up
early from school.

422
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:48,996
He always says people need
a break once in a while.

423
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:51,528
We went over to the piers,

424
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:55,699
and he took me on
one of those tour boats
that go all around the city.

425
00:23:55,941 --> 00:24:00,037
It was really freezing,
and I didn't have my coat,

426
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,508
so he gave me his.

427
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:07,618
And then when it got dark,
all the Iights
in the city came on.

428
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:10,917
I'd never seen it Iike that.
It was really cool.

429
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:17,627
Then when we got back
he bought me a burger
and took me home.

430
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:23,800
He wasn't all weird and stuff.
He didn't try anything.

431
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,398
I think that was one of
the best times I ever had.

432
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:38,144
How sick is that?

433
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:42,714
It's not sick. That's what
he wanted you to think.

434
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:47,683
He wanted to make you
Iike him because he knew
what he was doing was wrong.

435
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:50,789
So he never really Iiked me?

436
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,530
Yeah, I guess
that's what I thought.

437
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:02,538
You want a ride home?

438
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:04,166
My mom gave me
money for a cab.

439
00:25:04,243 --> 00:25:05,437
It's Iate. I'II take you.

440
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,479
No, that's all right.

441
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,207
It's almost over.

442
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:11,880
I know.

443
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,491
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

444
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:28,622
Hello?

445
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:31,634
Oh, my God.

446
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:39,106
He's still alive.
They're working on him now.

447
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:40,906
His mom found him.
He asphyxiated.

448
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:43,345
They don't know how Iong
he stopped breathing.

449
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:46,248
How?
Aspirin
and his anti-depressants.

450
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,254
Get out of here.
Get her out of here!

451
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:53,449
Get out! Are you happy now?

452
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:56,422
Is there anything else
you want him to do for you?

453
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:59,692
Get out! Get out of here!

454
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:03,096
Let go of me. I'm fine.

455
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,103
Oh, God.

456
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:13,875
Here's what the attending
told me.

457
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:17,438
Sam suffered from hypoxia
due to Iack of oxygen,

458
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:19,882
which Ied to cardiac arrest.
God.

459
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:23,911
He's on a respirator now.
The neurologist said
there is some brain activity.

460
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:26,253
Some? What does that mean?
Is he going to wake up?

461
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:30,318
Possibly. But there's
no telling how much
brain damage was done.

462
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:32,124
BENSON: Could it have been
an accidental OD?

463
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:33,391
Didn't find a note.

464
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,490
MUNCH: They don't
always Ieave one.

465
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,933
Look, AIex,
this kid had problems
Iong before you...

466
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:40,096
I want to know if Barnett
had any contact with him.

467
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:41,764
Dump the phones.
We already did it.

468
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,070
Barnett didn't call Sam.
Other way around.

469
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:47,669
15-second call from
Sam's house to Barnett's
near midnight.

470
00:26:47,746 --> 00:26:49,873
Are you trying for coercing
a witness?

471
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:51,779
15 seconds doesn't
seem Iong enough.

472
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,579
PIus Sam initiated
the contact.

473
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:55,279
It's Iong enough.
I don't care
who made the call.

474
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:59,347
Barnett had a strong influence
over him. It is possible
that he gave him the idea.

475
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:01,790
I don't want possible,
I want to crucify this guy.

476
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,919
Where are we
on unreported victims?

477
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,930
We ran the names
Tommy Priore gave us

478
00:27:05,998 --> 00:27:09,900
through DMV, public records,
tax rolls, utilities.

479
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:12,436
We came up with one hit,
Benjamin Tucker.

480
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:14,529
But you're not gonna Iike him.
Why?

481
00:27:14,606 --> 00:27:16,733
He's in Sing Sing,
convicted two years ago,

482
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:18,241
and his preference
is eight-year-old girls.

483
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,369
Another pedophile. Perfect.

484
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:21,969
Set it up.
I'II meet you there.

485
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:24,572
Where you going?

486
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,481
To try and save this case.

487
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:29,577
Barnett's attorney
filed a motion to dismiss.

488
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:35,390
Is this true?

489
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,484
Every word.

490
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:38,392
The complaining witness
is no Ionger available,

491
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:41,227
and the prosecution cannot
meet its burden of proof.

492
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,030
He's been incapacitated
for 12 hours, Your Honor.
He's not dead.

493
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:46,730
The motion to dismiss
is premature.

494
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:50,172
Devastated by hypoxia.
This Ieaves Iittle room
for interpretation.

495
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:51,300
So you're a doctor now?

496
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:52,400
Hold on.

497
00:27:52,477 --> 00:27:55,275
Is the boy going to
recover or not?

498
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:56,837
There's no way
to answer that.

499
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:58,246
She's not a doctor either.

500
00:27:58,316 --> 00:28:02,685
Mr. Kressler, it's not
particularly attractive to be
so happy about this tragedy,

501
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:05,416
so Iet's kill
the enthusiasm. However...

502
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,583
Your Honor, the People have
a right to try this case.

503
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:09,820
And the defendant has
the right to a speedy trial.

504
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:12,125
You've got three days. Next?

505
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:14,262
Sam Cavanaugh testified
in front of a grand jury

506
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:15,594
before he was
made unavailable.

507
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,430
I would Iike his testimony
to be read at trial.

508
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:18,628
He was never cross-examined.

509
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:21,002
My client has a right
to confront his accuser.

510
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:24,474
People v, Geraci,
When a witness has been
intimidated by the defendant,

511
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:26,408
the use of the witness's
grand jury testimony

512
00:28:26,478 --> 00:28:28,810
as a part of the People's
direct case is warranted.

513
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,678
Your client had contact
with Sam Cavanaugh
the night he overdosed.

514
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,274
Don't tell me
that is a coincidence.

515
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:36,752
It was a 15-second phone call,
originated by the witness.

516
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:39,655
Mr. Barnett told him
they couldn't speak,
and he hung up on the kid.

517
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:42,285
I would hardly
call this intimidation.

518
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,988
Four years of physical
and mental abuse.

519
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:48,999
Four years of manipulating
that boy into doing whatever
that man told him to do.

520
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:52,400
I would argue their entire
relationship Ied to the
witness's attempted suicide.

521
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:55,201
You want to prove he tried
to kill himself
because he was abused

522
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:57,538
so you can prove
he was abused. I...
What kind of Iogic is this?

523
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,101
Circular Iogic,
and it's bootstrapping.

524
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,615
Nice try, Ms. Cabot,
but the grand jury
testimony is out.

525
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,480
PIease, Your Honor...
Three days.

526
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:09,419
If the People can't make
their case by then,
I'II have to throw it out.

527
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,664
I started offending
when I was 18.

528
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,632
I had a Iot of anger, and also
I had a Iot of self-hatred.

529
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:29,539
You know, because of
what Roy did to me.

530
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:33,875
And because my parents
were...distant.

531
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:36,471
That right?

532
00:29:39,318 --> 00:29:40,945
I read about that kid
who overdosed.

533
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,682
You want, I could testify
against Roy for molesting me.

534
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:46,122
Your history
of Iying to obtain
more Ienient sentencing

535
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:48,319
makes that a Iess
than compelling offer.

536
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,294
I was a victim.
Yes, you were.

537
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:53,696
And you can help us
prosecute your molester
by giving us information.

538
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:57,065
You kept some kind of records
when you were offending,
right?

539
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:59,900
Little pictures,
mementos from your victims,

540
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:02,805
so you could...relive
the excitement of it all?

541
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,441
Yeah.
Where did Roy keep his?

542
00:30:09,382 --> 00:30:11,680
I don't remember.
Well, think a Iittle harder.

543
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:14,083
Seriously. No idea.

544
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:16,951
What do you want?
Well...

545
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:21,255
What can you give me?
We're done.

546
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:25,196
I want a transfer
to a psych facility
for sex offenders.

547
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:26,492
I don't belong in prison.

548
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:28,659
Oh, but Roy Barnett does.

549
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:33,830
I did some very terrible
things, but I know
they were wrong now.

550
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:37,239
When I'm released, I know
I'm not going to put myself
in those situations again.

551
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,369
I'm just going to stay away
from temptation.

552
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:42,710
No driving by schools,
no going to malls.
None of that.

553
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:44,841
If your information
Ieads to Barnett's conviction,

554
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:47,249
I will consider your request.

555
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,651
Only offer. Yes or no.
Right now.

556
00:30:56,395 --> 00:31:01,128
Roy knew
never to keep records,
but he had one weakness.

557
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:04,363
Videotapes.

558
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:06,264
Of what?
Him.

559
00:31:07,473 --> 00:31:10,670
With his victims.
He used to send them to us.

560
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,907
STABLER: You got these tapes?

561
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:14,537
That was his thing, not mine.

562
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:16,946
That's not good enough.
We need tangible evidence.

563
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:20,144
So you've got
this overdose kid.

564
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:24,019
I guarantee Roy
sent him tapes, too.

565
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,024
He couldn't help it.

566
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:38,696
Mrs. Cavanaugh,
we're very sorry to intrude.

567
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:41,038
May we speak with you
for a moment?

568
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,472
What are you doing here?

569
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:45,533
We have some new information
about Mr. Barnett
and your son,

570
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:48,273
and it's extremely important
that you allow us
to search your home.

571
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:50,645
No. Leave.

572
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:53,508
Mrs. Cavanaugh, we can't begin
to understand your Ioss,

573
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:56,350
but we can arrest
the man who molested Sam.

574
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:59,016
You could have taken out
your gun and shot my son
in the head.

575
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:02,424
It would have been the same
thing. Maybe better.

576
00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:07,932
I don't ever want to
see you people again.

577
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,905
It's okay.

578
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,206
Did you tell her
what we were Iooking for?

579
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:20,575
Well, before or after she
started yelling for security?

580
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:21,772
Does it matter?

581
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:23,508
Write her a note
and slip it under the door.

582
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:25,243
Leave a message
on the answering machine.

583
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,912
Do you really think
she cares about helping us
make our case?

584
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,750
Make her care.

585
00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:32,618
Well, we've still got this
other victim, Ben Tucker.

586
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:34,557
Never in a million years.
STABLER: Why?

587
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,527
You were sitting
right across the table
from him, EIIiot.

588
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:39,257
Just based on that,
do you think
he is a good witness?

589
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,959
Make him a good witness.

590
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,591
I can't make his priors
disappear.

591
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:44,863
Besides, that case would never
get past a grand jury.

592
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:46,598
AII of a sudden you just
take cases you can win?

593
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:49,573
I try the cases I am handed
by this squad.

594
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,769
You don't Iike the evidence
I've got, find me some more.

595
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,334
I can't do your job, too.

596
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:54,175
You can't do my what?
Out of Iine, AIex.

597
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:56,738
I am not out of Iine,
and I don't work for you.

598
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:59,012
You work for me,
at my discretion.

599
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:02,681
Your sole purpose in this
process is to bring me
a case I can prosecute,

600
00:33:02,756 --> 00:33:05,281
not one I have to fix.
Fine.

601
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,295
Then you tell us, Counselor,
how can we help you
put this man away?

602
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,593
What would you
Iike us to do?

603
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:22,240
Nothing.

604
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:25,468
You've done all you can.

605
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:40,992
PETROVSKY: Are the People
ready to proceed?

606
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,154
Request a continuance,
Your Honor.

607
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,494
We've been here before,
Ms. Cabot.

608
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,929
The People need more time
to gather additional evidence.

609
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:51,766
Well, unfortunately,
the People's time has expired.

610
00:33:51,838 --> 00:33:53,863
As the defendant has the right
to a speedy trial,

611
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,636
and pursuant to
CPL Section 30.30,

612
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,201
I have no choice
but to dismiss this case.

613
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,509
Mr. Barnett,
you're free to go.

614
00:34:13,226 --> 00:34:15,387
Stalking me, Counselor?

615
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:17,956
I need a search warrant.
What are we searching for?

616
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:20,864
Videotapes of Roy Barnett
engaged in sex acts
with minors.

617
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,663
You're kidding.
Where are they?

618
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,260
Sam Cavanaugh's house.
Oh.

619
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:27,568
And his mother
would rather see you dead
than Iet you search the place.

620
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:31,168
Information from
a reliable source?
Don't start.

621
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:33,542
He was a victim of Barnett's
until five years ago.

622
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:37,071
Which is old news.
What's the rest of the story?

623
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,885
He's in Sing Sing for
aggravated sexual abuse one,

624
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,444
plus a separate
fraud conviction.

625
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:44,820
I can't believe
you're even asking.

626
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:47,826
Roy Barnett is
a serial child molester.
He will not stop.

627
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:50,124
Neither of which is a reason
to grant a warrant.

628
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:51,459
The tapes are.

629
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:54,432
You have no idea
whether they even exist.

630
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:56,799
This is our Iast chance.
I have to risk it.

631
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:01,500
I won't order a search based
on the dubious word
of a convicted pedophile.

632
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:06,606
You Iook Iike hell, AIexandra.
Get some sleep.

633
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,522
Hey, where were you?
We gotta go.
Coffee. What's up?

634
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:22,528
Cabot called.
She wants us to meet her
at the Cavanaughs' now.

635
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:24,063
We got a search warrant?

636
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:26,292
She must've called in
a big favor.

637
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,970
Mrs. Cavanaugh,
I'm here to inform you

638
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:32,732
these premises are considered
a crime scene

639
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,603
and subject to search
by the police.

640
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,936
What crime?

641
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,874
Your son's alleged
suicide attempt.

642
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:39,104
Until we can prove otherwise,

643
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,511
we are required to treat it
as an attempted homicide.

644
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,709
Right. Maybe someone stuffed
the pills down his throat.

645
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:47,548
Maybe I did it.
Is that what you're saying?
Mrs. Cavanaugh, I...

646
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:50,749
I'd Iet you talk to him
yourself, but he can't speak.

647
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:52,519
He's in a rehabilitation
hospital.

648
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:54,992
Know when he's coming home?
I am not here to upset you.

649
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:56,494
Never.

650
00:35:57,731 --> 00:35:58,993
The only reason I am here

651
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:02,364
is to find evidence against
the man who hurt your son.

652
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:05,131
I am more than willing
to accept blame
for what happened to Sam,

653
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:09,005
but do not Iet Roy Barnett
get away with what he did.

654
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:21,311
Any restrictions
on the search warrant?

655
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,652
Nope. Whatever you can find.

656
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:47,812
Liv.

657
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:50,479
BENSON: What have you got?

658
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,778
I don't know.

659
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:55,954
Return address is Barnett's.

660
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:57,649
Never bothered to open it.

661
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:13,568
Oh, he's Ieaving town.

662
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,108
You know, we're really
going to miss you.
Now what?

663
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:17,666
We're helping you pack.

664
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:19,871
You think all that stuff's
gonna fit in his cell?

665
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,413
Probably not.

666
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:26,374
Barnett's being processed.
We're heading to Mulligan's
to celebrate.

667
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,284
Probably not gonna
want to do that.

668
00:37:28,355 --> 00:37:29,652
And why's that?

669
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:31,020
Dad's mad.

670
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:33,588
Get your asses in my office.

671
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:39,930
You searched the Cavanaugh
place without consent?

672
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,792
What?

673
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:44,632
Barnett's attorney's
on the horn with every city
official he can think of,

674
00:37:44,704 --> 00:37:46,262
screaming
Fourth Amendment violation.

675
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:48,466
We didn't need consent.
Cabot had the search warrant.

676
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,168
Try again.

677
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,641
Are you saying Cabot told you
she had a warrant?

678
00:37:58,084 --> 00:37:59,142
I don't remember.

679
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:00,584
Don't give me that crap.

680
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:04,021
You better start saving
your own jobs and stop
covering for the A.D.A.

681
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,422
She didn't actually say
that she had a warrant.

682
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,929
But she specifically told you
to meet her for a search,

683
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,021
implying she had a warrant.

684
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:13,730
She's out of her mind.

685
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,963
Captain, it was a good faith
search. As far as we knew,
there was a warrant.

686
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:19,528
EIIiot, good faith doesn't
cover Cabot Iying to you.

687
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:21,335
BENSON:
She did that to protect us.

688
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:23,137
What are you now, her Iawyer?

689
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:26,804
Those tapes showed Barnett
with half a dozen other boys.

690
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,904
If we hadn't found them,

691
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:29,949
we would have never known
about his other victims.

692
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,474
And if a judge
throws those tapes out,
we know nothing.

693
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:38,520
Linda Cavanaugh
never consented
to any search.

694
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:41,583
The Assistant District
Attorney Iied her way in

695
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:44,255
by claiming the apartment
was a crime scene.

696
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:47,960
Sam Cavanaugh's
alleged suicide attempt
was never investigated.

697
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,867
Ms. Cabot, you're not
going to sell that here.
Don't even try it.

698
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:54,306
This was a blatant
Fourth Amendment violation,
sanctioned

699
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,139
and indeed carried out
by the People.

700
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,702
Therefore, any evidence found
must be suppressed.

701
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,510
Mr. Barnett's Fourth Amendment
rights were not violated.

702
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,983
Linda Cavanaugh's
certainly were,
but she isn't the defendant.

703
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,383
Mr. Barnett is.

704
00:39:06,454 --> 00:39:09,617
He has no standing
to contest a search
of someone else's home.

705
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,521
Are you actually arguing

706
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:15,323
that you can march in Iike
the Gestapo and search
any private residence?

707
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,796
I am arguing I can search
any private residence

708
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:19,924
that doesn't belong
to your client.

709
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,163
And it will have no bearing
on these proceedings.

710
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:31,011
While I deplore
the Assistant District
Attorney's actions,

711
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:33,546
I am forced to agree

712
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:38,380
that the illegal search
of Linda Cavanaugh's residence
is a civil tort.

713
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:41,020
The defendant's privacy
was not violated,

714
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:45,047
and therefore he has
no Iegal standing
to contest the search.

715
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:48,118
Motion to suppress
the evidence is denied.

716
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:54,895
Ms. Cabot, I scarcely
know where to begin.

717
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,331
The Iiberties you have taken,

718
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:02,265
the disdain you have shown
toward the Iaw in this court,

719
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:06,143
are highly unethical
and a disgrace
to your position.

720
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:11,613
Be assured,
I will recommend your office
to Iook into your actions.

721
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:16,147
And you have done yourself
a real disservice
in my courtroom.

722
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:18,287
I won't forget it.

723
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:29,935
The tapes are in.
Good.

724
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:32,137
What about you?

725
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:34,367
Petrovsky acted
Iike I killed her dog.

726
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:36,967
Just one more enemy
to add to the Iist.

727
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:38,671
You took a big chance.

728
00:40:40,247 --> 00:40:44,479
You were never in jeopardy.
I made sure of that.
It will all fall on me.

729
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:46,486
You should've told us.

730
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,679
I am sorry.

731
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:50,917
No, you're not.

732
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,154
I am sorry you were ever
in the middle of this.

733
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:57,256
But you're right.

734
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,531
I'm not sorry about the rest.

735
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:06,166
I have to go.
I have an arraignment.

736
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:15,244
"Docket number 51024. People
v, Roy Johnathan Barnett,

737
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:17,841
"Six counts Sodomy
in the Second Degree.

738
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:20,614
"Six counts Use of a Child
in a Sexual Performance.

739
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:23,748
"Six counts Promoting
an Obscene Sexual
Performance by a Child.

740
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:27,157
"Six counts Possessing
an Obscene Sexual
performance by a Child.

741
00:41:27,228 --> 00:41:30,220
"Six counts Sexual abuse
in the Second Degree."

742
00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:31,992
PETROVSKY: How do you plead?

743
00:41:33,234 --> 00:41:36,692
DONNELLY: One month's
suspension without pay,
and that's a gift,

744
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,294
so you can save
the arguments.

745
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:39,805
I have no argument.

746
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:43,970
Linda Cavanaugh decided not to
file a civil suit against you,
me, the police department,

747
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:47,013
and the city
for your illegal search.

748
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:49,207
So may I offer you
a big congratulations

749
00:41:49,283 --> 00:41:53,083
on successfully
setting civil Iiberties
back 200 years?

750
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:55,922
It was her choice.

751
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,617
Oh, she had a choice?

752
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,258
Deciding her right to privacy

753
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:02,022
wasn't as important
as putting her son's
molester in prison.

754
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:05,190
No, AIex,
you decided that for her.

755
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:09,399
And you think
that's just fine.

756
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,936
You think that makes you
passionate and righteous.

757
00:42:12,006 --> 00:42:14,497
The ends justify the means
because you got away with it.

758
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:16,805
I take full responsibility
for my actions.

759
00:42:16,877 --> 00:42:17,901
Of course.

760
00:42:17,978 --> 00:42:20,640
You did it for the greater
good, the safety of society.

761
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:22,079
Bull. You did this for you.

762
00:42:22,149 --> 00:42:24,879
I did this for hundreds
of Barnett's future victims.

763
00:42:24,952 --> 00:42:27,284
One. One victim.

764
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:30,313
Sam Cavanaugh. Did it work?

765
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:33,460
Did it assuage your guilt?

766
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:36,557
No.

767
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:40,966
I don't think that's gonna
happen any time soon.

768
00:42:43,337 --> 00:42:45,134
I got news for you.

769
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:50,569
It won't happen. Ever.
