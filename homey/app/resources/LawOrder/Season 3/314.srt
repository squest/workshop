got to her first.

finds the body,

73
00:03:57,573 --> 00:04:01,407
can't get the trunk open,

This is where Paula worked,
on one of our drug research
teams.

80
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,163
What kind of research?
Squamous cell
esophageal cancer.

We're very close to testing
a promising new treatment.

82

Is that something
your company's
working on alone?

83
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,640
No. There's a drug
on the market called Rytex,

84
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,509
but we believe that ours
will be more efficacious.

Miss Grace?

86
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:45,178
Last night, around 8:00.

87
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:49,424
She said that
she was finishing up.

88
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,693
I assumed that she was
heading home from here.

It's a Iong commute
to Manhattan, Mr. Ragolia.

She always drive?

91
00:04:56,832 --> 00:05:00,359
Paula always said
that it was the best
part of her day,

92
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,199
her chance to
clear her head.

93
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:03,966
That's why she would
never move up here.

94
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,406
Does she have any family,
a boyfriend?

95
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:07,908
Both her parents are dead.

96
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,444
She never mentioned
anyone special.

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,178
She mostly kept
to herself at work.

98
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:18,049
I insisted that she spend
the holidays with me,
my wife and my kids.

99
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,279
Sounds Iike you
really took her
under your wing.

00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:23,689
In this business,
nurturing talent
can make you billions.

101
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,490
Paula was on her way
to a very bright future here.

102
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,027
What a waste.

103
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,261
Your victim
has vaginal bruising
and Iacerations from the rape.

104
00:05:34,337 --> 00:05:36,601
No semen,
just Rough Rider.

105
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:41,734
I ID'd the brand
of condom Iubricant
using the FBI database.

106
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,005
What about the rock?

107
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,378
Embedded in the ground,
but definitely
what killed her.

108
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:50,246
The trauma is
to the Iower right quadrant,
but with an upward impact.

109
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,981
Fracture pattern of the skull
indicates one fatal blow,

110
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:55,250
probably while she was
trying to fight him off.

111
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:58,054
So if the perp
didn't hit her
with the rock,

112
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:00,652
he may not have realized
why she suddenly
stopped resisting.

113
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,164
She get a piece of him?
Just his clothes.

114
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:06,030
Navy blue fibers
under her fingernails.

115
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,899
AIready sent it to the Iab.

116
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:11,768
I'm running the fibers now.
No prints in the car
other than hers.

117
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,172
Too much time
on your hands?

118
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:15,870
My kid visits, always Ieaves
something behind in my office.

119
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:18,209
My son used to
Iove these, too.

120
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,475
Used them to make
a model of your crime scene.

121
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:23,279
Here's the car.
We found her clothes
over here.

122
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:24,910
Nothing but garbage
around the body.

123
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:26,477
Any idea
how the perp got there?

124
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:29,422
There were tire tracks
behind her car,
made by different tires.

125
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:31,084
Goodyear radials, very worn.

126
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,129
But what was in her trunk
is much more interesting.

127
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:35,561
FIN: The Rytex?

128
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:38,496
I tested it. It's fake.

129
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,663
A million dollars worth
of sugar pills? Why?

130
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,466
Drug counterfeiting
is a booming industry.

131
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:46,030
Huge amounts
of fake antibiotics have
been sold over the Internet

132
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:47,200
and at Mexican pharmacies.

133
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,870
What about these?
High grade knock-offs.

134
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:52,743
Look Iike the real deal,
worthless for treating cancer.

135
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,976
But worth a hell of a Iot
to Paula.

136
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,414
BENSON: Nice place.

137
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:04,789
I wonder how many
cancer patients had to die
so she could get these views.

138
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:08,054
How Iong had Miss Grace
Iived here?
AImost a year.

139
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,290
Nice Iady.

140
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:11,026
Good tipper
at the holidays.

141
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,492
What about boyfriends?
Visitors?

142
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:15,397
None that I ever saw.

143
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:19,168
But Miss Grace didn't
Iook Iike she had guys
knocking down her door.

144
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,765
How much Ionger
is this going to take?

145
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:22,476
You got a train to catch?

146
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:24,979
Some prospective tenants
are coming to see the place.

147
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:27,572
How about a Iittle respect?
The Iady's been dead
Iess than a day.

148
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,777
She said
she was moving out.

149
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,815
See for yourself.

150
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,214
You have any idea
where she was moving?

151
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,488
AII I know is the owners
called and said to start
showing the place.

152
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,928
Gucci, Prada, Chanel,

00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:44,523
it's pretty pricey stuff
for a Iab tech.

154
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,433
Living above her means.
You Iadies are all alike.

155
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:49,697
Do you have a copy
of her Iease?
I don't think she had one.

156
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,137
She knew the owners.

157
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:52,640
BENSON: We're going
to need to talk to them.

158
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,643
I'II get you the number.
Name's Ragolia, Mr. and Mrs.

159
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,871
You seen either of them
around here recently?

160
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:01,246
Mr. Ragolia,
about once a week.

161
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:03,251
Said he was measuring
for renovations.

162
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:07,446
How much of this
do you think
Mrs. Ragolia knows?

163
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:10,756
It's terrible what happened
to Paula.

164
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:12,623
How well
did you know her?

165
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:14,390
She came for Thanksgiving
and Christmas

166
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:15,623
the past two years.

167
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:18,166
One of those introverted
science types.

168
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:20,326
But you felt you could
trust her in your apartment.

169
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:21,596
That was Kevin's idea.

170
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,538
I was more concerned with
finding someone who could
afford $7,500 a month.

171
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:27,735
That's a Iot on
a researcher's salary.

172
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,302
Kevin said Paula had
family money she inherited
when her parents died.

173
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,075
I think she went through
most of it.

174
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:35,241
BENSON: Is that why
she was moving out?

175
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:37,945
She told Kevin
she wanted to Iive
closer to the office.

176
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,682
She could rent
a place up here for
a third of what she paid us,

177
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:42,280
still have enough
Ieft over for a car.

178
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:44,656
I thought
she had a car already.
Didn't she drive to work?

179
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:48,527
No. Paula told me herself
she hated taking the train
every day.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,934
We checked
Paula Grace's financials.

181
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:55,197
She never paid a nickel
in rent to Ragolia.

182
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:56,670
Or chipped in
on the car she Ieased.

183
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,764
Ragolia co-signed
and made all the payments.

184
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:00,934
So she gets tired
of being a kept woman,

185
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,171
he gets
jealous-soon-to-be-
ex-Iover's disease.

186
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:04,542
Ragolia's wife
is a knockout.

187
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:06,513
Why cheat on her with somebody
who Iooked Iike Paula Grace?

188
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:08,982
Maybe she had
something else he wanted.

189
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,978
Oh, I can't
wait to hear this.

190
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,852
Your sympathy's
overwhelming.

191
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,322
What happened to you?

192
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:17,950
Skydiving. Hard Ianding.

193
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,995
He said he wiped out
riding his friend's Harley.

194
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:22,030
Yeah, and the only thing
he's riding now is a desk.

195
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:23,962
Dump on the victim's
cell phone just came back.

196
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,159
Let's find out
who she called.

197
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:27,828
Sure, make the gimp
do the busywork.

198
00:09:28,203 --> 00:09:30,637
How much Ionger
is the trial?
Couple more days of testimony.

199
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:33,004
You know, I got
a background check
on Paula Grace.

200
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:35,305
Got a Bachelor's
from the Pennsylvania
College of Pharmacy,

201
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:37,106
Master's in Biochemistry
from Cornell.

202
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:39,238
So, why are the drugs
in the trunk fake?

203
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:41,146
Industrial espionage?

204
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:43,480
Well, if she's
acting as a spy for
the makers of Rytex,

205
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:44,678
they're not paying her
too well.

206
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:46,084
She has a Iittle
under $2,000

207
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:47,679
in her combined
bank accounts.

208
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:51,283
She's a mole, all right,
but for the good guys.

209
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,759
Paula made two calls
Iast night.

210
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:56,059
A short one to Ragolia,
and a very Iong one
to an unlisted number.

211
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,565
I called the number.
It's our friends at the FBI.

212
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:00,568
She's blowing the whistle
on her own company.

213
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,866
Quantum's about to test
their version of Rytex.

214
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:05,236
MUNCH: So they conspire
to undermine the competition.

215
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:06,672
They sell fake Rytex

216
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:09,336
under the table
at half price to
pharmacies around the country,

217
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:10,844
knowing that
when the drug fails,

218
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,346
doctors are going to
Iook for an alternative.

219
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:14,143
They didn't count
on Paula Grace
going to the Feds

220
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:15,706
with her trunk
full of evidence.

221
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:18,776
Which gives Ragolia
a couple hundred million
reasons to shut her up.

222
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:20,253
Bring him in.

223
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:24,358
Thank you for coming in.
We just got a few things
we need to clear up.

224
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:26,451
Anything I can do to help.

225
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:30,260
It was...really
admirable of you,

226
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:31,993
making Paula
a part of your family.

227
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,627
Well, my wife's
just as responsible
for that as I am.

228
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:37,171
She Iiked Paula a Iot.
Really?

229
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,599
Then how come
she didn't know

230
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:40,869
that you paid for
her apartment and her car?

231
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,336
How dare you talk to
my wife behind my back?

232
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:45,675
FIN: We don't need
your permission.

233
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:48,308
We found enough fake Rytex
in the back of Paula's car

234
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:50,284
to stock about
two dozen pharmacies.

235
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:51,842
RAGOLIA: Fake Rytex?
Yeah.

236
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,217
Why would I know
anything about that?

237
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:54,949
No, you're not that smart,
are you?

238
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,992
But Paula was.
That's why you seduced her.

239
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,758
Big executive Iike yourself
interested in the mousy,
shy Iittle girl,

240
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,264
paying for her apartment,
paying for her car,

241
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,096
and she helps you out
with your Iittle scheme.

242
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:08,693
What scheme?
FIN: Quantum's stock
is taking a dive

243
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:13,105
while your promising
competition to Rytex
is 18 months behind schedule.

244
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:16,474
BENSON: So you flood
the market with fake Rytex
to damage its reputation.

245
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:19,412
Then, when your product
comes out, your company
rakes in all the profits.

246
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:22,279
You were set to cash in,
till you find out
she was working for the Feds.

247
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:23,443
What?

248
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,077
She was on her way
to bring the fake Rytex,

249
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:27,281
and you, to the FBI
when she was killed.

250
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:30,018
I didn't kill her.
I needed her.

251
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,923
Till you were done with her.

252
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:34,224
She wanted me
to Ieave my wife.

253
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:35,786
I said, "No way."

254
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:39,425
Later, she called me.
Said she was going
to make me sorry.

255
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,894
I didn't think
she'd go to the Feds.

256
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,004
That's it
until I get my Iawyer.

257
00:11:52,314 --> 00:11:54,282
I wouldn't get
too comfortable.

258
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:59,820
He Iawyered up.
We're handing Ragolia
off to the FBI.

259
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:02,152
Paula Grace
was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

260
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:03,316
Another victim?

261
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:06,384
Same area, same M.O.,
but this one
is still breathing.

262
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:07,690
(SIGHING)

263
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,960
Victim made the 911
from her cell phone.

264
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:13,433
Couldn't get a word
out of her.

265
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:16,596
Okay. We got it
from here. Thank you.
Thanks.

266
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:22,309
Hi, I'm detective Benson.

267
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:24,436
I'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

268
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:26,208
What's your name?

269
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,677
Francesca Jesner.

270
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:34,585
Can you tell me
what happened?

271
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:39,758
He made me
get out of the car.

272
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:43,624
I thought
he was going to kill me.

273
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,392
Did you see his face?
Not really.

274
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,335
How about
what he was wearing?

275
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,802
It was a blue uniform.

276
00:12:58,213 --> 00:13:00,204
He was a cop.

277
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:12,591
A client of mine
had a party at Lucio's.

278
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:16,592
I was driving home
when the cop pulled me over.

279
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,394
Tell me
what happened next.

280
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,402
He walked up to my window

281
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:28,770
and shined a Iight in my eyes,
so I couldn't see him.

282
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:33,603
He said I was weaving
and asked for my Iicense.

283
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,716
Then he made me get out
and take a breathalyzer.

284
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:41,816
Had you been drinking?
No.

285
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,322
He said that if I would
have sex with him,

286
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,322
he wouldn't arrest me.

287
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,698
When I refused, he got angry.

288
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,901
So I pretended to pass out.

289
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:01,504
(SOBBING)
He dragged me from the car

290
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,872
and said that
he knew I was faking,

291
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,311
and that he was going
to kill me.

292
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:11,814
So I Iet him.

293
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,821
During the attack,
did he say anything?

294
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:20,529
Nothing.

295
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,664
What did the car Iook Iike?

296
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:30,901
Unmarked.
Had a red Iight
on the dashboard.

297
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,573
It was a dark color.

298
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:36,246
Dark blue or black.

299
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:42,376
Francesca, is there
anything else that you can
remember? Anything at all?

300
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:47,285
He used a condom.

301
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:51,389
This is really,
really important.

302
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:55,592
Do you remember
what he did with the wrapper?

303
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,760
He put it in his pocket.

304
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:02,737
I remember thinking,
"Why would he keep that?"

305
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:08,535
Oh, my God. He kept
my driver's Iicense, too.

306
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,940
He knows where I Iive.

307
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:14,883
How's Francesca's rape kit?

308
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:18,013
It Iooked clean,
but we got a problem
with her blood alcohol.

309
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,522
Over the Iimit?
Way over.

310
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:22,822
Doc says she would
have blew about 0.12.

311
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:24,520
She said she never
had a drink.

312
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:28,930
Well, that's a good way
to get out of a DWI.
Accuse the cop of rape.

313
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,261
Well, he sure thinks
Iike a cop.

314
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:33,668
Took the condom wrapper
so now we can't get prints.

315
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:35,603
If there was a condom.

316
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,135
You think Francesca's
Iying about the rape?

317
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,508
She Iied about being drunk.
Maybe it's just a habit.

318
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,544
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

319
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:48,218
Francesca Jesner
has two prior DWIs.

320
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,345
The Iast one,
she got belligerent
with the arresting officer

321
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:51,753
and was charged
with resisting.

322
00:15:51,823 --> 00:15:53,814
So this time she figured
she'd Iie her way out of it.

323
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:56,190
Or maybe
she's telling the truth.

324
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:58,661
These cases have
too much in common.

325
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,925
Same area,
same time of night...

326
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,593
Paula Grace's homicide
was front page news.

327
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:05,863
Enough details
for Francesca
to fake her story.

328
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:08,872
There is no way
that she could have
faked that traumatized.

329
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,498
I'm telling you, Captain,
this woman was raped.

330
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:12,600
I just don't want to
send the rat squad
on some witch hunt

331
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:14,645
and screw
some innocent cop.
Neither do I.

332
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:17,238
Could've been
anybody in a uniform.
Didn't have to be a real cop.

333
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:20,751
It doesn't matter.
This woman is a rape victim
until we prove otherwise.

334
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:22,980
Nobody is jumping
to any conclusions

335
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:25,454
until we investigate
this case, okay?

336
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:29,890
Two DWIs and she's still
behind the wheel?

337
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,519
Her Iicense was revoked
once before.

338
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:32,688
She just got it back.

339
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:35,426
She is one moving violation
away from Iosing it for good.

340
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,762
Which gives her
the motive to Iie

341
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:38,063
when she got
pulled over Iast night.

342
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:39,967
I'II have Munch
pull all citations

343
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:41,505
and radio runs
from that precinct.

344
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:45,031
You two check out
the victim's story,
and not a word to anybody.

345
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:55,141
It was a big party.
Some hip artiste rented
the whole place out.

346
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:58,584
Open bar, top-shelf booze,
everybody off the A-Iist.

347
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,283
Must've been
300 people here.

348
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:01,848
Was she one of them?

349
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,518
Vodka-coke, no ice.

350
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:05,890
Three hundred guests
and you remember her
that quick?

351
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:07,454
She must've been
chained to the bar.

352
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:09,261
She was knocking them back
pretty steady.

353
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:13,361
AIone?
No, she was all over a guy,
hot and heavy.

354
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,338
When she started
getting sloppy, I think
he walked her out.

355
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,238
What did this guy
Iook Iike?

356
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:18,431
I don't know.

357
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,172
BIonde, tall.
You know,
every woman's dream.

358
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:25,115
I didn't Ieave with anyone.

359
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:27,014
Bartender says otherwise.

360
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:30,054
Parking attendant says
he saw both of you
Ieave in your car.

361
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:31,748
I say a cop raped me,

362
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:33,085
and you stick up
for your own.

363
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:36,421
Francesca, you Iied
about being drunk.

364
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,488
I want to believe you.
I do.

365
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:40,428
But you're not making it
easy for me.

366
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,794
I didn't tell you
about the drinking

367
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:45,131
because I knew
you would think
I made up the rape.

368
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,000
FIN: What about the guy
you Ieft with?

369
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:49,267
I used to work with him.

370
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,501
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
He's married.
I don't want him involved.

371
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:54,306
Well he's going to be,
unless you start
telling the truth.

372
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:55,812
Excuse me.

373
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,910
We parked and had sex.

374
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:02,519
When we finished,
he caught a cab.

375
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:05,852
I started to drive home
and the cop pulled me over.

376
00:18:05,924 --> 00:18:07,858
You should've told me that
from the beginning.

377
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:09,484
We'II be back.

378
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:16,961
What's up?
CSU wants us back
at the crime scene.

379
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:25,603
So what's here
that you couldn't
tell us on the phone?

380
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,668
A picture's worth
a thousand words.

381
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:30,509
Take me through
your victim's account
of what happened.

382
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:34,609
Francesca said that
the perp walked through
the alcohol field test here

383
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,651
and as she was coming back
is when he grabbed her.

384
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,814
See these drag marks?

385
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:42,792
They match the shoes
your victim was wearing.

386
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:44,692
We found gravel inside them.

387
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:46,354
These are
your perp's footprints,

388
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:48,831
and the tire tracks
match the ones
from across the way,

389
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,390
where Paula Grace
was found.

390
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:53,266
Shoe prints
tell us anything
about our mystery man?

391
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:55,636
Based on the depths
of the shoe impressions
and their size,

392
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:58,369
I'd say he's about
six foot, 200 pounds.

393
00:18:58,443 --> 00:19:00,468
Are there any cops
on your Iist of suspects?

394
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:02,069
What makes you think
it's a cop?

395
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:04,240
The blue fibers from under
Paula Grace's fingernails

396
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:07,751
are consistent
with NYPD issue
uniform pants.

397
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:15,017
MUNCH:
If Francesca Jesner
was pulled over by a cop,

398
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:16,185
he did not write a summons.

399
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:18,422
In fact, there were no
traffic stops or checkpoints

400
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,191
anywhere near the area,
either night.

401
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,527
CRAGEN: What about radio runs?

402
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,261
AII cars accounted
for in the 22 both nights.

403
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,496
Except one.

404
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:27,936
Unmarked?

405
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:31,908
Anticrime.
The cops worked in uniform.

406
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,702
Both nights,
MIA during the time
of the attacks.

407
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,475
Missing for how Iong?

408
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,449
Forty-nine minutes
unaccounted for

409
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:40,916
at the time
of Paula Grace's homicide,

410
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:42,509
and 36 Iast night.

411
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:44,145
CRAGEN: We have names?
Yeah.

412
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,788
AI Marcosi and Roger Graves.

413
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:50,191
Marcosi's got
more than 10 years on,
most of it on midnights.

414
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,422
Graves got out
of the academy
Iast spring.

415
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:55,557
Victim says
it was a white guy,
so Graves gets a pass.

416
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,863
Unless he knew
what his partner was
doing on traffic stops.

417
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:00,871
We got to get
their car down to CSU,
see if the tire tracks match.

418
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:03,601
Which means we're gonna
have to involve IAB.

419
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,905
I'II call the action desk,
have their jackets pulled,

420
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,706
see if either one's
been a target before.

421
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:11,340
Captain, before you do that,
Iet us take a run over
at the 22.

422
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,940
If this Marcosi
is a wrong cop,

423
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:14,644
I don't want him wise
that we Iike him for this.

424
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,587
Yeah. Lieutenant over there
is my old boss who works
midnights, Phil Urzi.

425
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,283
I'II finesse him.

426
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,558
URZI: That strip under
the West Side Highway,

427
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,291
worst spot
in the whole precinct.

428
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:30,198
Car strippers,
prostitution, narcotics.

429
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,168
But this is the first homicide
down there in years.

430
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:34,637
We're thinking
that something
scared our perp off,

431
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:36,003
that's why
we're checking
all police presence

432
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:37,598
in that sector
at the time of the attack.

433
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,666
We Iistened
to the division radio-tapes.

434
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:42,076
Two of your guys,
we can't figure out
where they were.

435
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:44,011
Marcosi and Graves.

436
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:46,516
How'd you know?
My problem children.

437
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:49,610
Two gold shield wannabes
who don't play by the rules.

438
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:51,712
We can't account for them
for about a half-hour.

439
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,484
Well, Iast night,
they were still
marked at a job,

440
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:55,753
but they'd been gone
40 minutes.

441
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:58,352
CIeared the job quick
when they heard
I was out Iooking for them.

442
00:20:58,429 --> 00:20:59,828
But why haven't you
ripped them yet?

443
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:04,163
Because Marcosi and Graves
bring in the big collars.
Guns, drugs.

444
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,495
Stopped a robbery in progress
three nights ago.

445
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:09,968
You mind if we have
a Iittle chat with them?

446
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,838
Not to bust their chops,
but we're thinking

447
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:13,900
maybe they saw something
that can help us out
with our case.

448
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:15,002
URZI: I don't mind.

449
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,876
But I guarantee Marcosi will.

450
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:19,048
Probably wants
the collar himself.

451
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,711
Man, can you believe it?

452
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:24,948
BENSON:
Hey, guys, got a minute?

453
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:27,355
You are?
OIivia Benson,
Special Victims.

454
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:28,483
This is Fin Tutuola.

455
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,789
We caught the two cases
under the West Side Highway.

456
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:31,954
How can we help you?

457
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,897
We thought maybe you saw
something if you guys were
down there the other night.

458
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:36,331
MARCOSI: Usually it's
the first place we check

459
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:37,527
at the top
of the tour because

460
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,797
that's where
most of the crimes
are committed in the precinct.

461
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:41,805
But both times
we were someplace else.

462
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:42,999
I wish we were there.

463
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:45,133
We've been
searching for the vehicle
in the bulletin ever since.

464
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:46,471
Can we call you
if we need anything?

465
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:49,638
MARCOSI: Sure, you know
where you can find us.
Thank you.

466
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:55,014
They were probably off
handling some investigation

467
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:56,747
they didn't want
your Iieutenant friend
to know about.

468
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,254
Yeah, well,
maybe you should
have asked them.

469
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:00,154
What, you got a problem?
Yeah, I do.

470
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:01,486
You softballing them
Iike that.

471
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,653
I'm not going to go hard
on two good cops unless
I think they done something.

472
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:07,596
What side are you on?
The victim's, where
we're supposed to be.

473
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:08,791
Yeah, well,
what about the truth?

474
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:10,231
Your victim's
definitely not
telling that.

475
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,859
Oh, and your cops are?
You didn't even ask them.

476
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:13,767
You sounded more Iike
their union rep
than anything else.

477
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:15,328
I just call it
how I see it.

478
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:16,896
Yeah? We just
blew our chance.

479
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:18,771
And now it's IAB's call.

480
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,975
Your detectives
went against policy.

481
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,643
They were following
my orders on our case.

482
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:30,085
For which a cop
may be a suspect.

483
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:32,748
We investigate cops.
And we investigate
sex crimes.

484
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:34,985
Look, it's not Iike
we were trying to hide
anything from you.

485
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,186
You spoke to a target
without us.

486
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:38,922
You of all people
should know better, Captain.

487
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:41,226
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

488
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,200
You knew about Marcosi
before we called you?

489
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,234
He's been under investigation
for six months.

490
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:49,796
Having sex
with a prostitute

491
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:51,068
in exchange
for a reduced charge.

492
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:54,009
And you didn't nail him?
Oh, we tried.

493
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:56,878
But we couldn't find her.
She's been missing ever since.

494
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:05,047
You're getting pretty good
with those.

495
00:23:05,124 --> 00:23:07,854
Better than Iifting weights.
Best workout I've had
in a Iong time.

496
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:09,359
When you going to tell me
how you really got hurt?

497
00:23:09,428 --> 00:23:10,918
Why should I give that up
when you never even

498
00:23:10,996 --> 00:23:12,327
once mentioned that
you have offspring?

499
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:15,765
My son? What,
OIivia told you that?

500
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,597
I bare my soul to you,
and you can't even share

501
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:19,500
that there's
a Iittle Tutuola
running around?

502
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:21,869
He's not Iittle. He's 18.

503
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:26,741
What did you find out?

504
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,837
Prostitute's name
is Raquel Stephens.

505
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:31,041
Missing Persons
has no record of a report.

506
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:33,949
How did IAB get onto him?
Anonymous tip.

507
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,954
Well, maybe
there's something
in her previous collars.

508
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,387
I already
cross-referenced them

509
00:23:38,457 --> 00:23:40,425
with other prostitutes
picked up at the same time.

510
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:43,222
Raquel was joined
quite regularly by
a Miss Mandy Mangum.

511
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:46,196
Including the night
of the alleged incident.

512
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:52,396
MANDY:
You come to remind me
of my right to remain silent?

513
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:54,939
You're Raquel's friend.
And Marcosi's yours.

514
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:57,703
And if he made
Raquel disappear,
he's no friend of ours.

515
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:58,936
Why the hell
should I trust you?

516
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:01,571
Because cops Iike Marcosi
make the rest of us Iook bad.

517
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:03,444
If he did
something to Raquel,
he's going down.

518
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,210
You got our word on it.

519
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,750
I used to share a place
with Raquel.

520
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:13,348
She disappeared about
a week after we got busted.

521
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:16,292
We know you two
were collared together
that night. What happened?

522
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:18,124
We were cuffed to
a bench in the precinct,

523
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:19,323
and Marcosi came by.

524
00:24:19,398 --> 00:24:20,490
Raquel bummed a cigarette,

525
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:22,056
and he took her into
a break room to smoke it.

526
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:23,396
FIN:
She tell you what he said?

527
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:24,834
She give him a freebie,

528
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:26,461
and he'II get
our case dropped.

529
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:29,166
So she did it right there
in the precinct.

530
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:30,799
Marcosi offer you
the same deal?

531
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:33,344
No, but he had
a real woody for Raquel.

532
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:35,812
Next day he called her,
asked her for a date.

533
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:37,178
She was excited.
Thought she might have

534
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:39,217
a permanent
get-out-of-jail-free card.

535
00:24:39,284 --> 00:24:41,582
When I Ieft for the weekend
she had plans with him.

536
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:43,518
Did you tell any other cops
about this?

537
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:44,886
Some guy from Internal Affairs

538
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:46,447
came by about
six months ago.

539
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:47,787
I played dumb.

540
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,455
I don't want
to disappear, too.

541
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,590
If you think of anything else,
give us a call.

542
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,306
You convinced now?
Not on the word
of some hooker.

543
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:03,498
Those fibers under
Paula Grace's fingernails

544
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:06,135
could have come
from any one of 40,000 cops.

545
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:09,180
But the tire tracks
on the perp's car didn't.

546
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,311
BENSON: When did these
go on?

547
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:14,181
TREVOR: Yesterday,
according to Motor Pool.

548
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:16,448
At whose request?
The cops who drive it.

549
00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:18,888
Said someone
stuck an ice pick
in two of the tires.

550
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:21,323
Guess Motor Pool figured,
might as well
replace them all.

551
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:22,985
Even if we find them
on some pile,

552
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:25,029
the chain
of custody's broken.

553
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:28,723
Looks kind of clean
for an anticrime car.

554
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,360
Someone had
the undercarriage washed.

555
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,461
So we're screwed?
Not totally.

556
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:37,806
Gravel.
From all four wheel wells.

557
00:25:37,876 --> 00:25:41,004
Consistent with what we found
in Francesca Jesner's shoes.

558
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:44,644
Your captain called.
You got to get back.

559
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:46,707
What's going on?
Trouble.

560
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:51,918
News is running a story
on a rapist cop
in the morning edition.

561
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,788
How did it Ieak?
Hopefully not from here.

562
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,192
You're Iooking at four
of the five people
who know about this,

563
00:25:57,262 --> 00:25:59,457
and nobody wants the media
badmouthing the job.

564
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:01,795
Well, now that it's out,
we're running on
borrowed time.

565
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:03,095
The paper won't
hold the story

566
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:04,465
to safeguard
the investigation?

567
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,800
They feel public safety
overrides.

568
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:08,737
What about the safety
of the roads?

569
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,604
Story breaks,
nobody stops for the police.

570
00:26:10,676 --> 00:26:12,735
And Marcosi gets
rid of his evidence.

571
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:14,608
We need a warrant
for his Iocker.

572
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,806
Well, my bosses
are going to want

573
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:17,178
more than
a couple rocks and fibers

574
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:18,614
before they go after a cop.

575
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:22,586
Then put a spin on it
as a necessary step to clear
Marcosi if he's not involved.

576
00:26:22,654 --> 00:26:24,884
AIex, we don't move fast
on this, we Iose them.

577
00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:27,221
Okay.
Thanks.

578
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:33,464
OFFICER 1: I smell a rat.
OFFICER 2: Make that three.

579
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:34,999
Come on, fellows.

580
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:40,528
Here we go. 157.

581
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:46,834
(OFFICERS CHATTERING)

582
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:49,377
BENSON:
He's quite the Iadies' man.

583
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:50,881
Let's bag everything.

584
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:57,447
Bingo.

585
00:26:58,023 --> 00:27:00,116
Rough Riders.
Our favorite brand.

586
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:02,717
Hey, that's private property.

587
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:06,929
Yeah?
These private property, too?

588
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,591
Locker belongs to the city.

589
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,931
The contents are mine.
You can't do this.

590
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:13,801
Well, this says we can.
You got to talk to us.

591
00:27:14,773 --> 00:27:17,867
BENSON: Have your union
delegate meet you over
at SVU.

592
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:21,637
I don't need a union delegate.
I got nothing to hide.

593
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:25,144
You think
that I killed a girl
under the West Side Highway?

594
00:27:25,217 --> 00:27:27,412
Are you nuts?
You fit the description
of the suspect.

595
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,750
AIong with 100 other guys
in my command.

596
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,220
But the only one
unaccounted for

597
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,018
at the time
of both crimes is you.

598
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:34,683
I bend the rules
a Iittle, so what?

599
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,251
Well, then
there's your vehicle,
matches what the perp drove,

600
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:39,058
and Forensics places you
at the crime scene.

601
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:40,564
AIong with a dozen
other cars.

602
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:42,327
We're constantly
checking the area.

603
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,767
Why'd you take it
to the car wash?
It was caked in mud.

604
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:46,997
Is that
why you conveniently
had the tires replaced?

605
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:50,200
We came out
and found two flats,
courtesy of an ice pick.

606
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:51,674
CRAGEN: You got an out
for everything, don't you?

607
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:53,836
I don't have to explain
how I work to you.

608
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:56,710
Nobody in that precinct
brings in more collars
than me.

609
00:27:56,782 --> 00:28:00,309
Really?
Well, how many cops
in the precinct date hookers?

610
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:02,580
Oh, I get a Iittle
bit on the side.

611
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:04,645
I don't pay for it.
That's not a crime.

612
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:07,157
It is when you
make them disappear.

613

(PAGER BEEPING)

614
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:09,721
What are you talking about?

615
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:12,730
IAB is investigating you
for Raquel Stephens.

616
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:13,924
Excuse me.

617
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:15,864
Raquel?
BENSON: Yeah, Raquel.

618
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:18,494
You collared her Iast year.
She gave you a freebie.

619
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,368
You Iet her walk,
then she just disappears

620
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,067
after her Iittle date
with you.

621
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:25,900
She went to an alcohol rehab
somewhere upstate.

622
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:27,467
FIN: You remember where?
She didn't say.

623
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:29,480
I swear, I didn't
do anything to her.

624
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:30,537
You want to go down
for this?

625
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:33,880
I am not going down.
I didn't rape those girls.

626
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:35,852
I break the rules
a Iittle bit,
but I get results.

627
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:37,445
We're trying
to help you here, AI.

628
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:40,753
Why should I believe you?
You just got to
take my word for it.

629
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:43,260
We're talking
rape-homicide here.

630
00:28:43,395 --> 00:28:47,354
If you didn't do it,
worst thing IAB can do
to you is a five-day rip.

631
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:57,142
I was down there
the night of the murder,
under the West Side Highway.

632
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,235
FIN: Doing what?
I had a date in the car.

633
00:28:59,312 --> 00:29:00,404
Where was your partner?

634
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,175
Looking out for me,
and it's a good thing
he was.

635
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:03,442
He see anything?
Yeah.

636
00:29:03,516 --> 00:29:05,643
Our boss, Lieutenant Urzi,
came driving towards us.

637
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:07,379
So Graves comes up,
knocks on the window.

638
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:09,944
We got out of there,
no Iights,
before Urzi caught us.

639
00:29:10,022 --> 00:29:11,319
Who was the girl?

640
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,449
Some random citizen
picked me up. She offered.

641
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:15,460
I don't even know her name.

642
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,029
Give us a second.

643
00:29:23,102 --> 00:29:24,433
FIN: Marcosi's talking.

644
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:26,904
Put himself
at the scene the night
of Paula Grace's murder.

645
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,270
We got another victim.

646
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:29,433
Marcosi's been with us
for hours.

647
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,703
No, no, no.
It could still be him.

648
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:33,211
This is six weeks old.
And she's just
reporting it now?

649
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,712
She was afraid
to accuse a cop,

650
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,544
came forward after
she saw it on the news.

651
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:38,379
Where is she?
Interview.

652
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:40,385
Fin, I want you
on the phone to IAB.

653
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:42,318
They're sweating
Marcosi's partner
Graves now.

654
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:43,980
I want to know
everything they got.

655
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:45,580
OIivia, I'm calling in Huang.

656
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,558
I want you and him
in with the victim.

657
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:54,390
I came off
the West Side Highway,
took a shortcut.

658
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:57,197
He stopped me,
said that I was speeding.

659
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,606
He told me
to get out of the car.

660
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,800
Then he told me
to take off my clothes.

661
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:07,778
I just obeyed.
I kept staring at
the gun on his belt.

662
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,212
BENSON: You didn't
have a choice, Stacia.

663
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:12,217
Maybe I should have
screamed, fought back.

664
00:30:13,352 --> 00:30:15,582
A cop with a gun
stopped you.

665
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:19,022
You made the right decision.
You survived.

666
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,130
Stacia, can I ask you
a question?

667
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,896
During the rape,
did he experience
any sexual difficulties?

668
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,300
He was on top of me,
and then he stopped,

669
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:36,238
and at first I thought
that he'd finished,

670
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,506
but then I realized
that he Iost his, you know...

671
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:43,874
His erection.
Yeah.

672
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,283
So then,
how did he react to that?

673
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:51,686
I opened my eyes

674
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:58,224
and he slapped me
across the face so hard
that I cried out.

675
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:03,927
And then he started again.

676
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:11,235
Stacia,
do you recognize
any of these men?

677
00:31:16,883 --> 00:31:20,375
It was dark
and my eyes were closed.
I never saw his face.

678
00:31:21,454 --> 00:31:23,319
Thank you. Excuse me.

679
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:24,981
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

680
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:28,785
I called IAB.
Graves isn't talking.
CRAGEN: Where was Marcosi?

681
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:31,091
I checked the roll call.
He wasn't working that day.

682
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:32,357
He's got everything else
covered.

683
00:31:32,431 --> 00:31:33,921
What do you want
to bet he's got an alibi?

684
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,491
Doc, can you help us
out here?

685
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:40,505
The badge, the uniform
and the gun all bolster
your perp's sense of power,

686
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:43,440
which enhances
his masculinity
and his control.

687
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,870
That's probably why
he became a cop
in the first place.

688
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,209
He keeps their driver's
Iicenses as trophies.

689
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,305
Strong possibility.

690
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:51,816
Every time
he Iooks at them again,
he relives the thrill.

691
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:54,079
She didn't resist,
he couldn't perform,
so he hits her.

692
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:55,984
I mean, this guy
gets off on violence.

693
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:59,957
And killing the first victim
probably gave him an appetite
for more.

694
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:01,186
If that car hadn't come by,

695
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,852
he would have killed
Francesca Jesner, too.

696
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:04,760
Marcosi fit your profile?

697
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,321
Well, I'd Iike to spend
some time with him.

698
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,599
Do it.

699
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,861
I've seen your arrest record.
It's very impressive.

700
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:14,270
Ever since
I was a Iittle boy,

701
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,274
all I wanted to be
was a detective.

702
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:18,275
Thrill of the chase?

703
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:21,071
I make a collar,
I get a real rush.

704
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,812
The same rush you get
when a beautiful woman
comes on to you?

705
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:32,718
Yeah.
Yeah, it's kind of
the same, you know?

706
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:36,254
It's Iike a game.
"Will she? Won't she?"

707
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:38,562
And if she says no?

708
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:40,254
PIenty of fish in the sea.

709
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:46,331
What about on duty?
What do you do when you
meet a woman on the job?

710
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:48,770
Department regs
say stay away,
but I can't help it

711
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,240
if these girls
call the command

712
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:52,106
and they come
Iooking for me.

713
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:54,572
You do all this
great work on the street,

714
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:55,239
and they won't
give you a gold shield.

715
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:57,977
That must frustrate you.
You know what frustrates me?

716
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:01,214
Everybody is so concerned
about my personal Iife.

717
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:04,356
You can't make detective,
you break a few rules.

718
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:06,221
You can't get a woman
to sleep with you,
what do you do?

719
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:11,356
You are so wrong.
I don't need to rape.
You think I did this?

720
00:33:11,465 --> 00:33:12,796
Give me a chance
to clear myself.

721
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,699
You bring in your victims.
I'II stand in a Iineup.

722
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:24,607
How's Francesca going to
pick Marcosi out of a Iineup

723
00:33:24,678 --> 00:33:26,009
when she couldn't
even give us a sketch?

724
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,603
What the hell's
going on over here?

725
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:28,943
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

726
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:30,916
BENSON: Hey, what's up?

727
00:33:30,984 --> 00:33:32,747
If you're Iooking
for Franny, you're too Iate.

728
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,979
Francesca Jesner?

729
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,578
That girl sure knows
how to party.

730
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:37,646
Your buddy
got her in the car
without your help.

731
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,919
A cop?
They've arrested her
before.

732
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:41,688
Thought she was going
to claw his eyes out

733
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:45,289
before he got
the cuffs on her,
yelling he raped her.

734
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:49,935
Perp must have seen
a news story

735
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:52,062
and snatched Francesca up
so she couldn't ID him.

736
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:54,073
Neighbors get a make
on the car, or a plate?

737
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:56,575
AII they gave us
was a dark sedan,
red Iight on the dash.

738
00:33:56,643 --> 00:33:59,305
Marcosi's still here.
Rule him out.
How much time we got, Doc?

739
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:00,971
He chose not to kill her
in the apartment

740
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,879
because he wanted
the thrill of arresting her.

741
00:34:02,949 --> 00:34:05,782
I'd guess
he'd keep her for a while,
until he got tired of her.

742
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:07,547
Anything?
I checked Communications.

743
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:11,580
No cars called in on a job
or a response anywhere
near Francesca's apartment.

744
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:14,593
Maybe Fin's right
and our guy isn't a cop.

745
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:18,162
You said that the badge
makes our perp feel
Iike a real man.

746
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:21,792
Ted Bundy and how many
other serial killers
did the exact same thing?

747
00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:24,564
What if our guy's
just some schmuck
playing dress up?

748
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:27,869
Men impersonate cops
for the same reason
that they rape and kill.

749
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:31,138
It's a Iack of confidence
combined with the need for
the ultimate power trip.

750
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:33,145
Not to mention
the perfect disguise.

751
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:34,942
Nobody's going to question
a cop pulling them over.

752
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:36,107
Or making a collar.

753
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:37,650
Francesca's neighbors
didn't think twice

754
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:39,241
when they saw our guy
take her away.

755
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:41,844
AIso explains why he
was alone in the car.
No partner.

756
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:43,685
Your impersonator unit
help us out?

757
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:45,748
I'II pull the files,
see if anybody fits.

758
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:47,555
The night Paula Grace
was killed

759
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,119
Marcosi said he thought
he saw Lieutenant Urzi
following them.

760
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:55,134
Now if Urzi
and our perp both
drive a dark Crown Vic...

761
00:34:55,235 --> 00:34:56,964
Then it could have been
our perp.

762
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,803
Get away from me.

763
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:01,932
Take it easy.
What, are you kidding me?

764
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:04,067
I know I'm not pure,
but you and your buddy
from rat squad,

765
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,339
they got me riding a desk.
For what?

766
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:07,744
You made yourself
Iook wrong,

767
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,906
and we were just
doing our jobs.

768
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,177
Had you been in our position,
you would have done
the exact same thing.

769
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:13,481
Now do yours
and help us out.

770
00:35:13,753 --> 00:35:15,846
You got some nerve
asking me for help.

771
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:19,085
The perp snatched up
one of his previous victims.

772
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,924
You wasted your time
fingering me.
You're right.

773
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,464
So hate us
but don't Iet her die.

774
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,532
That happens, it's on you.

775
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:29,090
Go to hell.

776
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:32,702
TUCKER: We can rule out
these guys.

777
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:34,740
Interested in the toys,
but they don't play
with them.

778
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:36,571
Whoever this guy was,
he needed the gear.

779
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:39,237
You can't buy uniforms
without departmental ID.

780
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:40,973
How about vendors?

781
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,476
Only a dozen stores
in the Tri-State sell
NYPD equipment,

782
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:47,019
and we keep a pretty
tight watch on them.

783
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:49,020
I'II make a call.

784
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,555
I got all the violent ones.

785
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:55,322
They use the uniform
for bank robberies,
home invasions, rapes.

786
00:35:55,395 --> 00:35:57,659
MUNCH: I ran the entire Iot
for prior sexual assaults,

787
00:35:57,731 --> 00:35:59,699
with and without
impersonation as an M.O.

788
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:01,631
Came up with 13.

789
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:04,728
By the time
we get through these,
Francesca could be dead.

790
00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:05,828
TUCKER: Thanks.

791
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:09,467
Three stores in the Iast year
caught selling NYPD gear
to anybody willing to pay.

792
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,773
We closed two of them down
before your attacks.

793
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:14,473
Third one's still open,
but on probation.

794
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,810
Let's go.

795
00:36:18,752 --> 00:36:20,379
O'KEEFE:
We check ID on everyone.

796
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:21,579
Sure, now you do.

797
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:22,917
After you were
investigated Iast year

798
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:24,422
for selling phony
police shields.

799
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:26,823
They were replicas.
Came with a disclaimer.

800
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,555
And the Kevlar vests
IAB caught you selling
to drug dealers,

801
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:31,529
they replicas, too?
They had ID.

802
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:33,691
I checked. I swear.

803
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:35,299
IAB cleared me.

804
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:38,337
And now they're
foaming from the mouth
to de-authorize you.

805
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:42,034
AII those academy grads
spending $5,000 a pop
to buy their new gear,

806
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:44,542
taking their business
elsewhere.
Okay. Okay.

807
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:46,670
Everything over the counter
was Iegit.

808
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,646
There might be some guys
on the mailing Iist
who aren't.

809
00:36:48,715 --> 00:36:50,012
Okay.
Let's have them now,

810
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,948
along with
your sales records
for the Iast six months.

811
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:53,918
Let's go. Let's go. Now!

812
00:36:57,657 --> 00:37:00,387
A couple of these names
have already come up
in the impersonator files.

813
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,449
What do you expect?

814
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:03,257
That place is a police buff's
wet dream.

815
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,924
One of them bought
handcuffs and a gun belt.

816
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:08,763
Here's two uniform shirts,
a nightstick,

817
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:11,099
another one with full
highway patrol gear,

818
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,105
one red dashboard Iight.

819
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,201
You know how many
red dashboard Iights
are sold each year?

820
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,971
It'II take us a week
to track them down.

821
00:37:18,044 --> 00:37:20,012
Look what just blew in.

822
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,383
What are you doing here?

823
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,088
You were going to ask me
whether or not I was sure
it was Lieutenant Urzi

824
00:37:29,155 --> 00:37:31,851
that followed me the night
of Paula Grace's murder.
I got that right?

825
00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:33,586
You going to ask questions
or answer them?

826
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,992
I only saw the car, not him.

827
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:37,757
But I wrote down a partial
Iicense plate number

828
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,129
to check against his car
back at the precinct.

829
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,566
It wasn't his.
It's got to be your perp's.

830
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,127
Give us the number.
We'II run it.
I already did.

831
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:46,331
It's not
a department vehicle,

832
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:48,465
and there's only one
dark blue Crown Vic

833
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,202
with anything Iike it
in the city.

834
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:53,007
It's registered
to a Jeffery Trapani.

835
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:56,079
819 West 88th Street.

836
00:37:56,249 --> 00:37:58,217
That's right in the middle
of the crime zone.

837
00:37:58,285 --> 00:37:59,513
Look, we don't have Trapani,

838
00:37:59,586 --> 00:38:01,247
but I've got
a Jeffery Trapper.

839
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,721
One red dash Iight
and a set of uni blues.

840
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,655
He was a guest
of the state
for burglary two

841
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,387
until he made parole
about a half a year ago.

842
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:10,429
I'II get Cabot on standby
for a warrant.

843
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,589
Tell her what we're doing.

844

Have her meet us
at the Iocation.

You did the right thing.

Hey, he's got to keep
his stash somewhere.

853
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,059
Maybe where he's stashing
Francesca.
Let's go.

854
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:49,929
Any idea where this guy
could be?

855
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,301
Munch checked.
Trapani's got a job
with the Parks Department.

856
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,397
Part of his work release.
Bring him in. Run a Iineup.

857
00:38:53,474 --> 00:38:56,068
Guy Iike this
isn't going to confess.
We know where Trapani is.

858
00:38:56,143 --> 00:38:58,008
Let's put him
under surveillance.
Too risky.

859
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,512
If we Iose him,
he might snatch
another victim.

860
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,172
What about the one
he already grabbed?

861
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:04,445
We play by our rules,
not his.
Captain?

862
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,918
We'II keep somebody
on the apartment in case
Trapani comes back.

863
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:09,683
You two,
get to the park
and pick him up.

864
00:39:13,794 --> 00:39:15,489

Yeah, we're at the park.

Tell the Captain and Cabot
Trapani's not here.

but you're not much of a cop,

904
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:14,836
Followed you straight to her,

907
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:22,907
That's going to be the Ieast
of your problems, pal.
