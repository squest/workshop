1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:04,832
sexually based offenses are
considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:07,170
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

4
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:08,971
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:12,605
are members of an elite squad
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:14,376
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,016
Hi, we're Iooking
for a patient,
Stephanie Rawley?

8
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:20,213
BENSON: Hey!

9
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:21,448
We don't have her.

10
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:23,047
STABLER: You sure?
She's a rape victim.

11
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,558
I haven't had
one all night.

12
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:27,493
Call came from
this hospital,
just got it.

13
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:28,927
Well, maybe you
mixed up hospitals.

14
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:30,828
Maybe you could
check the computer.

15
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:34,062
Oh, well,
here's your miscom.

16
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:36,502
She's not in emergency.
She's in the ICU.

17
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:40,538
Good God.

18
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,372
What'd this guy
do to her?

19
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:44,139
Put her on
Iife support.

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,741
Beautiful girl.

21
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:50,148
He didn't touch that.
There's not
a mark on her face.

22
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:53,915
BENSON: No defense wounds,
either.

23
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,388
STABLER: BIitz attack
from behind?

24
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:57,416
Knifepoint to the throat?

25
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,084
STABLER: Let's
check her chart.

26
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:00,560
She has pneumonia.

27
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:03,093
But she's out
of the woods.

28
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:05,065
We brought the fever
down with antibiotics.

29
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,566
Somebody called in a rape.

30
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,796
That was me.
I'm Dr. Sedaly.

31
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:12,063
She was transferred here
from Mountcastle Rehab.

32
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,437
Drug overdose?

33
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:14,839
No, she was in
a car accident.

34
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,775
BENSON: When?
About a year ago.

35
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:19,905
She's been in
a persistent vegetative
state ever since.

36
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:23,576
Okay, she's been in a coma.
I don't understand why you
called us.

37
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:25,950
Because of the pneumonia,
I ordered a chest X-ray

38
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:28,455
and the Iab automatically
ran the standard tests.

39
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:29,683
Hers turned up positive.

40
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:30,986
For what?

41
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:33,823
A baby.
She's six weeks pregnant.

42
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,376
My daughter
was raped?

43
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,644
We should have
kept her at home.

44
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:31,686
I told you I could
take care of her.

45
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,812
Prayer wasn't going
to bring her back,
Janice.

46
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,516
Mountcastle was
our Iast hope.

47
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,818
How could they
Iet this happen?

48
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:38,154
I promise you,
we're going to find out.

49
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:41,252
Was Stephanie moved from
rehab for any reason,
say six, seven weeks ago?

50
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,523
No.

51
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:46,831
Check all of
Mountcastle's employees.
Anyone who had access.

52
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:49,496
Don't bother.
I know who did this.

53
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:50,765
Who?

54
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,967
It couldn't have been David,
he still has
a restraining order.

55
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,134
BENSON: Who's David?

56
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,576
The man Stephanie
was Iiving with.

57
00:02:57,646 --> 00:02:59,079
The wreck was his fault.

58
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:00,944
Why is there
a restraining order?

59
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:04,008
After she went
into Mountcastle,
he tried to kill her.

60
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:11,151
I never tried to kill her.
I only told them her wishes.

61
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:12,352
Death wishes?

62
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,725
We Iived together for
six years. Yeah, we talked
about everything.

63
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:16,457
Stephanie never wanted
to Iive Iike this.

64
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,192
FIN: Ma and Pa catch you
tripping over the plug?

65
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,632
No, but they convinced
a judge I might.

66
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:23,234
I Iove her more than
anything in the world.

67
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,739
Really? How's your
sex Iife been Iately?

68
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,672
None of your business.
It is now.

69
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,845
If you two think...

70
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,746
You two are sick.

71
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:38,351
Besides, I haven't
seen her in months.

72
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,116
Call me a hopeless romantic,
but I don't see
a Iittle court order

73
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:43,657
standing in the way
of your undying Iove.

74
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,060
You don't know
her parents.

75
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:50,592
If it wasn't for them,
I'd have been there to
protect her from that pervert.

76
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:54,032
You blame them, even though
you're the one that put her
in a vegetable crisper?

77
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,133
It was my bachelor party.

78
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:05,278
The guys dragged me
off to a strip club
in Port Chester.

79
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:07,781
My friends got smashed,
so I called her
to come get me.

80
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,612
She drives out there,
you being a man,

81
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:12,482
had to take the wheel,
even though you'd had a few.

82
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:14,044
She never showed up.

83
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,217
She got hit by
a truck on the way.

84
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,728
MUNCH: He came across
pretty straight up.

85
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,788
FIN: We're not completely
ruling him out, but we're
thinking an inside job.

86
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,300
That's a big place.
Benson and Stabler
could use some help.

87
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,428
They're interviewing
the coma wing staff now.

88
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,870
I don't even want to think
how under-reported
coma rape is.

89
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,874
CRAGEN: Well, victims
don't tend to come forward.

90
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,910
Counselor, question.

91
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:39,276
What would it take
to blanket DNA
an entire facility?

92
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:41,008
A constitutional amendment.

93
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:43,277
But we know
the rape happened there.

94
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,286
It doesn't cover
probable cause for
each individual employee.

95
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,686
Not to mention patients,
vendors, visitors...

96
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:50,952
I mean, where would
your genetic dragnet end?

97
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:52,220
Whose side
are you on?

98
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:53,921
What about that
case in Germany?

99
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,120
11-year-old girl
was raped and killed,

100
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:58,791
they tested everybody
in the town.
Over 16,000 men.

101
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,767
But it was on
a strictly
volunteer basis.

102
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,063
I'II take volunteers.

103
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:05,106
It's still cost-prohibitive.
It's $600 a pop.

104
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:07,607
Who says they're all
gonna be processed?

105
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:10,304
I say we get
everybody's DNA now
while we've got 'em,

106
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,676
we can narrow down
the suspects Iater.

107
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:19,178
I gave your tech
a separate Iist of everyone
working six weeks ago,

108
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:21,586
including swing, graveyard
and weekend shifts.

109
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,181
We'II need to start
with the men who worked
directly with Stephanie.

110
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,717
At this point,
she's basically
receiving supportive care,

111
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:30,526
turned to prevent bedsores,
change IV tubes.

112
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,663
Mostly female nurses.

113
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,626
Except for CIark Jensen,
her physical therapist.

114
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:36,796
That should
make it easy.

115
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,965
Oh, and her neurologist,
Dr. Mandell.
He's her primary.

116
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,167
And where can
we find him?

117
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,573
He's with a patient.

118
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,042
STABLER: Catch you
at a bad time?

119
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:52,348
Not at all.
I'm just doing an LP.

120
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:53,952
Is that a
spinal tap?

121
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,923
She's having
unexplained
seizures

122
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,686
and since she can't
fill in the blanks,

123
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,058
I need to find out
what's going on.

124
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:04,659
Don't you normally
have a nurse present?

125
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,098
I'm an old hand at this.

126
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,794
STABLER: I meant
as a chaperone.

127
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,370
That policy isn't
for the patient,

128
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,101
it's to protect the doctor
from false allegations.

129
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:16,234
She can't make any.

130
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,211
Neither can
Stephanie Rawley.

131
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:20,105
And she has
a Iegitimate one.

132
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,879
Yeah, I can't tell you
how upset I was to hear that.

133
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:25,544
You examine her alone?

134
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,888
Often.

135
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,826
Stephanie's parents insist
that I repeat every test,

136
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,793
hoping there'II be
a change in her condition.

137
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:35,454
And what's
her prognosis?

138
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,931
Oh, it's very grim.
She's suffered
massive cortical damage.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,628
She has minimal
brain stem activity.

140
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:44,194
She has no intellectual
or motor function.

141
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:47,097
STABLER: Sounds Iike you
spent a Iot of time with her.

142
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,575
I spend time with
all my coma patients.

143
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,874
Would you have any problem
volunteering your DNA?

144
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:53,873
Not at all.

145
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,212
FIN: CIark Jensen?
Yes?

146
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,253
You do these exercises
with Stephanie Rawley?

147
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:04,087
Three times a week,
to keep the joints fluid and
the muscles from atrophying.

148
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,923
She's hooked to Iife support.
You roll those machines
up here?

149
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:10,988
I have a special routine
for the coma patients.
I can do them in their beds.

150
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,327
You don't say.

151
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,299
Two-minute break,
Mr. Crowe.

152
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:21,006
You happen to hear about
the voluntary DNA test?

153
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,505
I was the first in Iine.

154
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:25,375
You work with Stephanie a Iot.
Who do you think did it?

155
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:26,471
I don't know.

156
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,709
But I can't believe one
of my co-workers is a rapist.

157
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,410
What about a patient?
Or visitors.

158
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,043
You ever see this guy?

159
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,246
(SIGHS)

160
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:35,255
When?
Month or so ago.

161
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:37,791
I came in early one morning,
he was with her.

162
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:40,828
I knew the deal,
but when he told me
his side, I felt for the guy.

163
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,260
Didn't report it, though.

164
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,195
What exactly was he doing
when you walked in?

165
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,634
SIeeping in her bed.

166
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,604
You Iied to us,
Mr. Andersen.

167
00:07:52,574 --> 00:07:53,768
I had to.

168
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,139
The second the Rawleys
find out I broke
the restraining order,

169
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:57,269
they'II have me arrested.

170
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,609
You Iooked me
right in the eye
and had the violins going...

171
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:02,172
I stayed away as Iong as
I could, then I started
visiting once a month.

172
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,514
Guess we all know
what you brought her
instead of flowers.

173
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:05,678
You're wrong.

174
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,120
How'd you manage
to sneak in there?

175
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,486
There's a nurse
on night shift.

176
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,286
She feels bad for me,
she Iooks the other way.

177
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:14,089
So you get to spend the night
with her in the moonlight,
just Iike old times, huh?

178
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,323
Naturally,
it got hot and heavy.

179
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,931
She gets agitated
at night.

180
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,962
She shakes,
her face twitches.

181
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,165
What do you do
about it, David?
I just hold her.

182
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,375
The doctors say
that she's not aware,

183
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:29,842
but it seems to
calm her down.

184
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:32,641
So you'd have no objections
then, to taking a paternity
test, huh?

185
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:33,738
None.

186
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,214
I want to know who did this
to her as much as you do.

187
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,212
BENSON: So far nobody has
a clue or has any problem
giving up their DNA.

188
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,690
FIN: Including the fiancé,
who was at
the top of our Iist.

189
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,817
Still headlining mine.

190
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:48,522
I think he's so Iovesick
he doesn't care whether
he goes to jail or not.

191
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,257
If that's the case,
why not just admit it?

192
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,696
Cause he's freaky sick.

193
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:54,291
I don't know.
They were gonna be
married in one week's time.

194
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:55,927
BENSON: Come on,
Iike that makes
a difference?

195
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,699
If she didn't give consent,
it's still rape.

196
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:59,296
I'm saying she would've
if she could've.

197
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:00,864
Fiancé, best case scenario.

198
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:03,775
It's not Iike she's facing
psychological trauma
over this. She's produce.

199
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:05,210
Mrs. Rawley.

200
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,942
Try to stay calm,
we're gonna be right there.

201
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:13,284
Mrs. Rawley went to mass
and when she came back,
Stephanie was gone.

202
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:14,378
Where is she?

203
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:17,583
Nurse said she'd been
transferred back to
the rehab center.

204
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,524
Why would they send her back
to where she was raped?

205
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:22,185
Where is she?
Look...

206
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:24,128
Tell me where she is!

207
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,723
STABLER: Mrs. Rawley,
Iet us handle this.

208
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,099
I want to see my daughter.
Right now.

209
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,138
I don't understand
what the problem is.

210
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,604
Was Stephanie
readmitted?

211
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:33,902
Yes, a few hours ago.

212
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,909
Don't tell me you put
her in the same room.

213
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:38,741
Well, yes,
but she isn't
there now.

214
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:40,542
Well, where is she?
The procedure room.

215
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:41,673
For what?

216
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,377
You're gonna have
to talk to Dr. Mandell,
he's the one who ordered it.

217
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:46,352
Ordered what?
What is he doing to her?

218
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:49,413
Mrs. Rawley,
do us a favor
and stay here.

219
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:56,987
BENSON: Dr. Mandell,
can we have
a word with you?

220
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,590
Hey, this is a sterile field.
Get out of here.

221
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,362
Who the hell are you?

222
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,063
Dr. Garrison.

223
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,729
Now, would you
please get out?

224
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:06,797
As soon as you tell us
what's going on here.

225
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,808
Just a routine procedure.

226
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,776
Dr. Mandell called me in.

227
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,646
To do what exactly?

228
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,938
Terminate the pregnancy.

229
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:23,523
I understand you just
interfered with
a medical emergency.

230
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:25,752
BENSON: What's that,
doc-talk for cover-up?

231
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,352
What are you
talking about?

232
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,659
You tried to destroy
evidence in a rape case
in which you're a suspect.

233
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:32,393
No wonder you were so willing
to give up your DNA.

234
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:34,935
You knew you could fix it
so there'd be
nothing to compare it to.

235
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:38,461
Look, all I knew was
that Stephanie Rawley's
Iife was in danger.

236
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:41,099
It's funny how the docs
at Wheaton Memorial
seemed to miss that.

237
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:45,339
Yes, well, they're not
experts in the care of
the profoundly devastated.

238
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,840
So you decide
to play God.

239
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,041
No, I called in
Dr. Garrison,

240
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:53,554
who agreed that it would
be malpractice to allow
the pregnancy to continue.

241
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:54,747
How very noble of you.

242
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,222
Except for the fact
that you failed to get
the parents' consent.

243
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,889
It's right here.
STABLER: That's crap.

244
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:05,296
Mrs. Rawley came to us,
hysterical, when she found out

245
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,799
Stephanie was
brought back here.

246
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:09,364
I dealt with Mr. Rawley.

247
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:13,306
I didn't know
what else to do.

248
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,304
I knew you'd
never consent.

249
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:16,570
Of course I wouldn't.

250
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:19,374
A sick pervert
raped our daughter.

251
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:21,608
I wanted that
monster out of her.

252
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:24,174
Was it Dr. Mandell's
idea or was it yours?

253
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:31,455
He called and told me
the risks of continuing
the pregnancy.

254
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,652
After all this,

255
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,598
I couldn't Iose
my daughter.

256
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,635
An abortion goes
against everything
that we believe in.

257
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:43,830
This is different.
It's Stephanie.

258
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,666
Do you want to raise
that thing inside her?

259
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,868
That thing is
our grandchild.

260
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,210
Why don't we
talk over here.

261
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:00,052
I'm a father, too.

262
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,422
What would you do?

263
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:06,721
I don't know.

264
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,498
I come visit every day
on my Iunch break.

265
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,358
With Mrs. Rawley?
No, alone.

266
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,496
What are you saying?

267
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:26,340
I'm sorry to
have to say this,
it's standard procedure,

268
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:27,904
but I should
get a DNA sample.

269
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,108
Robert!

270
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:32,909
You just assaulted
a police officer.

271
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,284
It's your call.

272
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,622
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

273
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:47,631
Questioning the father
as a suspect is never
a crowd-pleaser.

274
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:50,967
Verbal vitriol you'd expect,
anyone else think the father
protests a bit too much?

275
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,027
You're not a father.

276
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,904
You don't have a raped
daughter in a coma with
a devil cake in the oven.

277
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:56,375
That you just
tried to abort.

278
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:58,605
Well, we'II know if
it's Dad soon enough.

279
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,670
When do we get the products
of conception for testing?

280
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,511
STABLER: We don't.
They're keeping it.
FIN: Why?

281
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,845
Wife's Catholic.

282
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:06,478
Still, I've never had
a keeper with a stranger
rape before.

283
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:09,022
John, OIivia's mother
was raped by a stranger.

284
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,785
My mother
made a choice.

285
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:12,917
Look, OIivia,
we were just talking...

286
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,154
No, save it.

287
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,820
If the same thing
happened to me,

288
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:18,092
morning-after pill,
no question.

289
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,724
BENSON: So where
are we on the case?

290
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,099
No abortion,
no fetal tissue.
We're screwed.

291
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,661
We'II just have to
wait a couple of months
to start paternity tests.

292
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,400
Until then,
we'II work it
without DNA.

293
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,169
Where are we with
the rehab employees?

294
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,040
We ruled out a handful
with verifiable
medical reasons.

295
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:33,945
And we interviewed
everybody on the Iist
that volunteered their DNA.

296
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,983
I'm more interested
in anybody who refused.

297
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,608
That would be
two employees.

298
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,983
Okay, Iet's split up
and find out why.

299
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,752
SAMUEL: I know the drill.

300
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:46,385
Somebody committed a crime,
so Iet's check out
the black guy.

301
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,688
That stinks of
racial profiling.

302
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:48,956
We're Iooking
at everyone.

303
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,930
Where's your
probable cause?

304
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,556
What about a
search warrant?

305
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,329
This flies in the face
of the Fourth Amendment.

306
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,070
Mr. Hill, supplying
your DNA is voluntary.

307
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,538
No, it's not.

308
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:02,167
If you decide
not to volunteer,
you're presumed guilty.

309
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:03,870
I guess you're right.
So just ante up.

310
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,311
Hold on.
Mr. Hill has
a valid point.

311
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:11,348
Our Iikes, dislikes
and habits are all stored
in huge computer systems.

312
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:15,788
On top of that, you got
facial recognition technology,
public video surveillance.

313
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:17,916
National ID cards.
Where does it end?

314
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:19,983
Every piece of data
you put out there,

315
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:22,962
exponentially increases
the control The Man
wields over us.

316
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,261
I can see you understand
why this conversation
ends here.

317
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:27,596
Good day to you both.

318
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:31,331
Mr. Hill, if you didn't
rape Stephanie Rawley,
DNA can only exclude you.

319
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:32,838
We're off your back.

320
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:34,101
No.

321
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:37,943
Fascist pig.

322
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:40,373
What the hell was that?

323
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:44,410
Good police work.
Here's your DNA.

324
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,677
Well, what if I have a fatal
illness or something? Then I'd
know. I don't want to know.

325
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,484
We won't be testing
for any diseases.

326
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:52,025
But what if someone
gets ahold of the test,

327
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:54,061
finds out that I
do have a disease,
then denies me insurance?

328
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,425
I can't make all
those medical bills.

329
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,157
I assure you,
no one outside
the police department

330
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,528
will have access
to your DNA.

331
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,760
Once you exclude yourself,
it's destroyed.

332
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,799
Okay. AII right.

333
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:07,369
Well, what if I've committed
some crime in the past, huh?

334
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,341
Can you arrest me,
once you get ahold
of my DNA?

335
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,537
Have you committed
another crime?

336
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,045
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

337
00:15:13,114 --> 00:15:16,606
No. But, you know.
Guys...

338
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:17,810
They make mistakes
all the time,

339
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:19,944
guys go to prison for years
before they figure it out.

340
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:24,185
Mr. Baltzer, if you don't
clear yourself, we're gonna
have to start digging around.

341
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,953
Why?
And asking questions.

342
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:27,392
Why?
Look, you had
access to the victim.

343
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,793
You were here alone,
at night, no witnesses.

344
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,388
No, no,
that's not true.

345
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:32,955
I am not here alone,
I swear.

346
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:34,228
There are a Iot of people
who wander these halls.

347
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:35,462
Like?

348
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,504
Like the vending guys,
the delivery men.

349
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,436
The fellow who
picks up the...

350
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:42,700
Picks up the what?

351
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,005
You know,

352
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,112
from the morgue.
The stiffs.

353
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:52,313
I get hungry.

354
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,583
The vending machines upstairs
have better selections.

355
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:58,353
Well, how do they compare
with the snacks in, say,
the coma wing?

356
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,418
I don't know.
I don't go there.

357
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:03,293
Oh, come on.
AII those nights
you've roamed the halls

358
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:06,698
jonesing for a Ding Dong fix,
you never once checked out
the coma wing?

359
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:08,201
What are you getting at?

360
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,865
Wesley, we're collecting DNA
from everyone who has contact
with the rehab.

361
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,805
We'd appreciate
your contribution.

362
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,502
No. No, I don't think so.

363
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:17,670
STABLER: Why not,
what's to hide?

364
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:21,477
I know how you cops operate.
You get a case,
you can't solve it,

365
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,781
you plant evidence,
make Wesley your fall guy.

366
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,185
Sounds Iike you've
had a run-in or two
with the police.

367
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:28,586
I don't have a record.

368
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:31,524
No, but we did find
a dropped complaint
against you.

369
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:32,890
Maxine Hatters?

370
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,487
Who the hell is that?

371
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,622
The woman you
assaulted a year ago.

372
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:38,222
The woman you
tried to choke.

373
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,226
She called the police?

374
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:45,166
She's Iucky I didn't
have her arrested.

375
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,869
You attacked her.
Why would you be
the one to press charges?

376
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:52,140
Because she
stole my wallet.

377
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:55,640
I only took it so
I could turn him in.

378
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:57,412
Creep tried
to strangle me.

379
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,113
That's a serious charge.
Why drop it?

380
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:01,087
I didn't Iike the way
I was being treated.

381
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:04,125
I tried to tell my story
and your boys in blue
put it back on me.

382
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,319
You want to tell us,
we'II Iisten.

383
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:10,160
So, I'm sitting in
this chicken joint,
Iike, 3:00 a.m.

384
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:13,429
This guy comes over,
starts asking me
about the chicken.

385
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,134
The chicken.
MAXINE: Yeah.

386
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:17,364
He offers to buy me some.
Some chicken?

387
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,237
Yeah. Only when we
get up to the motel
room to eat it...

388
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:21,900
Maxine, the guy's a john.

389
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:24,878
You're all alike. I'm a pro,
so it doesn't matter
he tried to kill me.

390
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:28,541
We don't care about your
night job, we're just trying
to get the story straight.

391
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:33,048
So we get up to
the motel room,
I ask him how he wants it,

392
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:37,182
I'm supposed to strip naked,
Iie flat on my back, not move
a muscle, not say a sound.

393
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,886
You got a problem
with that?
No.

394
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:41,924
He's the one who
had a Iittle problem,
if you know what I mean.

395
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:43,931
Okay, so you Iaughed at him,
he chokes you.

396
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:47,867
No, I was very understanding,
till he started
filling the tub with ice.

397
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:48,960
For what?

398
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:52,336
He told me to Iie in it.
I'm Iike, "No way."
That's when he chokes me.

399
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,671
He was trying to Iower
your body temperature.

400
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:58,269
Said he couldn't do it
unless I really seemed dead.

401
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:05,511
BENSON: You gotta
be kidding me.

402
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:08,715
Wesley, what is this thing
with you, water and women?

403
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:10,888
I'm just doing my job.

404
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,086
I mean, the hot showers I get,
but ice baths?

405
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:14,560
We tracked down Maxine.

406
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,088
Your old prostitute.

407
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:19,463
The one you hired
to pretend to be
pretty much Iike her.

408
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,092
I heard you
weren't real happy
with her performance.

409
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,137
How'd Stephanie Rawley do?

410
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,833
I told you, I've never
been to the coma wing.

411
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:29,303
Could you please go?
You're gonna get me fired.

412
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:30,639
Oh, we wouldn't
want to do that,

413
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:32,873
seeing as you've
only been here for,
what, a couple of months?

414
00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:35,382
Before that you were at

415
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:38,514
Upson Funeral Home.

416
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,579
What went wrong there?

417
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:42,816
Nothing.

418
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:47,894
No, Wesley was great.
It was just time
for him to move on.

419
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:49,260
After seven weeks.

420
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:50,491
Yes.

421
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,159
Uh-huh.

422
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:55,794
Ma'am, just so you know,
the Federal Trade Commission

423
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,738
no Ionger requires you
to buy your casket
at the funeral home.

424
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:01,275
You can save a few thousand
by buying from the supplier.

425
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:05,177
Not when you take into account
the discount package I'II be
offering you.

426
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,408
I'II be right back
to discuss that.

427
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,782
I assume you gave
her the price Iist,
as required by Iaw?

428
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:13,412
AII right.
We had some thefts.

429
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:17,982
Some jewelry,
a few gold fillings,
so we installed a camera.

430
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,118
We're not here
about grave robbing.

431
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,095
Well, Wesley wasn't
our thief.

432
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:24,397
But I'm afraid we
did catch him on tape.

433
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:25,933
Doing what?

434
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:28,964
The Iate Mrs. Thurgeston.

435
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:33,466
Kind of Iate to be
paying your respects,
isn't it?

436
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,271
STABLER: Guess
you two were close.

437
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:37,370
Really close.

438
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:38,673
You Iike
the quiet type, huh?

439
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,646
PIease turn it off.

440
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:44,082
Oh, relax,
it's over in a second.

441
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:47,386
Ah, but I guess I don't
have to tell you that.

442
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:49,150
WESLEY: Can I please
have a glass of water?

443
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:50,851
(KNOCKING)
BENSON: Heavy on the ice,
right?

444
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,329
BENSON: He's got dry mouth.

445
00:19:56,398 --> 00:19:56,763
At Ieast we're
making him nervous.

446
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,629
HUANG: Yeah,
you more than EIIiot.

447
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:02,499
He's a necrophiliac.
His greatest fear
is to be judged by women.

448
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:05,632
The emasculation
tactic might not be
the way to go on this one.

449
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,834
That's why we
pulled you out.

450
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:07,967
What are you
thinking?

451
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:10,012
Shame is driving
his compulsion.

452
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,411
He was most Iikely
raised in an overly
religious household,

453
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:14,915
where an intense
degree of shame
was attached to sex.

454
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:17,817
So what are we thinking?
Empathize?

455
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,218
Tell him that
we understand?

456
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,820
I doubt that
he understands.

457
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:26,254
Pretty girl, isn't she?

458
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:29,423
I guess.

459
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,861
AImost Iike SIeeping Beauty
and she's been
in a coma for a year.

460
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:36,135
Look, I've never
seen her before.

461
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:38,673
Come on, Wesley,
I understand.
I'm a guy.

462
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,536
Hard opportunity to pass up.

463
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:43,078
It's not Iike she
knew what was going on.

464
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:44,203
You don't understand.

465
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,578
I do, more than you think.
It's what every guy wants.

466
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:48,580
No one judging you...

467
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:50,542
Right.

468
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,384
Just Stephanie
Iying there perfect.
Deaf, dumb and blind.

469
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:54,889
No, it doesn't
work that way.

470
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:55,981
Why doesn't it
work that way?

471
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:57,491
She's alive.
Come on!

472
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,892
Don't split hairs with me,
Wesley! Come on!

473
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:01,862
People snap out of
comas all the time.

474
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,627
Well, what about the hooker
that you hired, huh?

475
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,361
She was alive
and kicking, pal.

476
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:09,666
And I bet she told you
what a miserable failure
I was.

477
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:12,264
Yes, she did.
And we had a big
Iaugh at your expense.

478
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,499
I knew she'd talk.

479
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,010
(SNIFFING)

480
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:18,342
You can't trust
a woman with a pulse.

481
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,678
CRAGEN: Get him his water.

482
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:26,188
Okay, but I don't see
this guy giving it up,
whether I'm in there or not.

483
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:28,054
HUANG: What if there's
nothing to give up?

484
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:30,115
Obviously we weren't
watching the same tape.

485
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:33,161
I'm just saying,
there are some extreme
cases where a necrophiliac

486
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:35,595
can't sustain the arousal
required to penetrate,

487
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:37,656
Iet alone impregnate,
a warm body.

488
00:21:38,434 --> 00:21:39,526
So, you don't
need me after all.

489
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:40,626
No, hold on.

490
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:43,001
The only thing
rendering Mr. Dilbert Iimp

491
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:46,599
is the 12-to-25 he's facing
on rape one as opposed to...

492
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,303
What does
necrophilia get him?

493
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:49,571
Sexual misconduct.

494
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:51,738
A misdemeanor.
Great. One year, max.

495
00:21:51,814 --> 00:21:53,839
CABOT: Is there anything
that Iinks him to Stephanie?

496
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,009
Any witnesses,
physical evidence?

497
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:58,349
We'II have paternity
in two months.

498
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:01,356
Well, at the very Ieast,
Iet's save the Iate
Mrs. Thurgeston

499
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:03,085
another spin in her grave.

500
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:06,161
We'II charge him
with necrophilia,
get him off the street.

501
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:14,167
"Docket number 269501.
People vs. Dilbert.

502
00:22:14,236 --> 00:22:17,262
"Sexual misconduct
130.20 sub 3."

503
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:19,598
Sub 3?

504
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:21,165
Which one is it, Counselor?

505
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:24,679
Was the sexual conduct
with an animal or
a dead human body?

506
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:27,409
Mr. Dilbert is a funeral home
attendant who was videotaped

507
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:29,610
having sex with
a human corpse.

508
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,283
COHEN: Your plea, Mr. Dilbert?

509
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:32,582
Not guilty, Your Honor.

510
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,020
I'II hear from
the People on bail.

511
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,182
$100,000.

512
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:36,747
COHEN: For an A misdemeanor?

513
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:38,953
CABOT: He has insufficient
community ties,

514
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:41,792
poses an ongoing threat,
and, we believe,
is a flight risk.

515
00:22:41,864 --> 00:22:44,833
He has Iimited
financial means,
no criminal record,

516
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,630
and given
the non-violent crime
he's been charged with,

517
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:49,534
I see no threat
to the community.

518
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:51,971
Your honor, Mr. Dilbert
is the number-one suspect

519
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,736
in the rape of
a comatose patient.

520
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,300
We believe this heightens
the flight risk considerably.

521
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:59,177
I'm sorry, I don't see
an indictment on that charge.

522
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:00,340
You will.

523
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:04,443
Until I do, His Honor
cannot possibly consider
it in determining bail.

524
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,112
Request ROR.

525
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:08,785
Bail's set at $5,000.

526
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:11,824
So he'II be
out by morning.

527
00:23:11,894 --> 00:23:14,328
Free to ruin
someone else's
daughter.

528
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:16,524
Why couldn't you charge him
with Stephanie's rape?

529
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,294
We don't have enough
evidence to support it yet.

530
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,595
Mr. RAWLEY: When will you?

531
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:22,136
We need the fetus' DNA
to determine paternity.

532
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,934
The earliest an amnio
can be done is 14 weeks.

533
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:26,474
That's almost two months.

534
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,772
They could have it now
if they had the tissue.

535
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:31,209
That's not an option.

536
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,770
HUANG: You know,
I may have one for you.

537
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:34,543
Dr. Huang is familiar
with the case.

538
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:37,347
With amniocentesis,
as with chorionic
villus sampling,

539
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,684
there's always
a chance of miscarriage
or other complications.

540
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:40,813
Oh, my God.

541
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,051
HUANG: That's why they've
been experimenting
with alternative testing.

542
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,026
A colleague of mine,
a forensic gynecologist,
has been successful

543
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:49,496
in adapting the alternative
to determine early prenatal
paternity.

544
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:56,431
BENSON: So what did
you get for us?

545
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:58,700
Well, we took 30 cc
of Stephanie's blood

546
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:02,141
and we subjected it to density
gradient centrifugation

547
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:04,236
to remove the maternal
non-nucleated
red blood cells.

548
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:05,337
HUANG: Leaving you only
with the fetal cells.

549
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:06,403
So, did it work?

550
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,780
Well, mind you,
even during
the optimal period,

551
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:12,412
the frequency of fetal cells
in maternal blood is
only one in ten million.

552
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:15,423
Luckily, we have this
high-precision magnetic
cell-separation technology.

553
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:17,425
BENSON: So, did it
work or not?
Yes.

554
00:24:17,493 --> 00:24:20,121
Did you compare it to Wesley
the Necro's DNA sample?

555
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:22,562
There was no need.
The fetus' blood type is AB.

556
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:24,360
The mother's is type A,
which means...

557
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:25,661
The father can
only be type B.

558
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:28,794
And Wesley is type A.
So, he cannot be the father.

559
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:30,099
That's right.

560
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,230
Damn it.

561
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:33,673
We have those other
volunteered samples to run.
How many are type B?

562
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:37,508
Well, not the fiancé,
not Mr. Riley,

563
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:40,476
not the night custodian,

564
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:42,208
not him...

565
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:44,012
Hello.

566
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:46,679
Look who we have here.

567
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:51,993
Do you have any idea how many
people have type B blood?

568
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:54,120
One in ten.
We did our homework.

569
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:56,426
And you're the only
one who had type B

570
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:58,933
and had access
and tried to
abort the evidence.

571
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:01,936
Doc, you just keep
popping up on our
radar screen.

572
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,301
Now what are we
supposed to think?

573
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:05,602
Well, fortunately,
you don't have to.

574
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:11,078
Modern technology has removed
that burden. You have my DNA,
just run it.

575
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,773
Well, we'II get the results
back in a few days.

576
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,942
The problem is, you make us
wait till then, we're gonna
be in no mood to bargain.

577
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,219
I think I'II
take my chances.

578
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:20,677
(KNOCKING)

579
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:24,824
BENSON: Why, Dr. Huang.
What brings you here?

580
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:27,761
Some fascinating results
from the gynecological
examinations

581
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,391
performed on Dr. Mandell's
other female coma patients.

582
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:33,935
These are forensic pictures
taken with a culposcope

583
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:36,870
of the uterine walls
of your patient,
Audrey Logan.

584
00:25:37,306 --> 00:25:39,240
Dr. Mandell,
help us out here.

585
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:43,038
What's your diagnosis?

586
00:25:43,112 --> 00:25:45,103
I'm not a trained OB/GYN.

587
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:48,641
Come on,
we all did gynecology
in med school.

588
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:50,648
Give it a shot.

589
00:25:55,024 --> 00:25:56,822
Well, it Iooks Iike
a healthy uterus, no

590
00:25:57,427 --> 00:26:01,796
signs of endometriosis,
no polyps, no cysts.

591
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:05,301
Well, it does take
a trained eye, but if
you notice right there,

592
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:07,165
there's miniscule scarring.

593
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:08,966
STABLER:
From a sexual assault?

594
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,837
No. I'd say more Iikely
from a recent abortion.

595
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:14,868
So, you raped her, too.

596
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:17,676
And got rid of the evidence.

597
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:19,672
I need to speak
with my attorney.

598
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:26,917
Doc Mandell took
care of both women.

599
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,323
We know he tried to abort
Stephanie's fetus,
he's not copping to the other.

600
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:33,123
Well, what do we know
about raped coma victim
number two?

601
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,298
Audrey Logan, captain of her
high school debate team

602
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:40,268
until she went to a rave
three years ago and ingested
one too many party favors.

603
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,362
Yeah, now she's captain
of the drool team.

604
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:43,667
Fin went to get
her medical records.

605
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,571
What have you
dug up on the doc?

606
00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:48,110
No dirt, per se, yet,
but Iisten to this.

607
00:26:48,178 --> 00:26:50,942
Turns out he works
two days a week
at a place called Diotyne.

608
00:26:51,014 --> 00:26:52,709
Bio-tech company.

609
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:54,079
What does he
do there?

610
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:55,709
Parkinson's research.

611
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:57,412
Well, it make sense.
He's a neurologist.

612
00:26:58,088 --> 00:26:59,385
CRAGEN: Audrey's
medical files?

613
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,424
No record of an abortion
and the only operation

614
00:27:01,491 --> 00:27:04,221
was for an ovarian cyst
removed four months ago.

615
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:06,194
Time frame fits
with the scarring.

616
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:07,729
FIN: Guess who the OB/GYN was.

617
00:27:07,797 --> 00:27:09,162
Dr. Garrison.

618
00:27:09,232 --> 00:27:11,598
That's the same woman
Mandell brought in to
abort Stephanie.

619
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:13,659
I think it's time we
invite her in for a chat.

620
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:15,102
FIN: Tried, she wasn't
at the hospital.

621
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:16,934
She works for some
research Iab called...

622
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:18,406
Diotyne?

623
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:21,302
How do you know?

624
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:23,312
Just a crazy hunch.

625
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:27,876
My relationship with
Dr. Mandell is none
of your business.

626
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:30,715
He's in a Iot of trouble,
Dr. Garrison.
And he's dragged you into it.

627
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:33,017
Dr. Mandell hasn't
dragged me into anything.

628
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:35,088
You're awfully
accommodating.

629
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,952
How's it work?
He rapes 'em,
you scrape 'em?

630
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:39,620
He's not a rapist.

631
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:44,193
As I explained,
Stephanie's Iife was,
and is, at risk.

632
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:45,427
BENSON: And what about
Audrey Logan?

633
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:47,333
You did a good job
removing her cyst.

634
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:50,038
Didn't even Ieave
a scar on her ovary.

635
00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:51,835
But you did Ieave
one on her uterus.

636
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:53,637
How do you
explain that?

637
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:55,811
It's not what you think.

638
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,247
Oh, yeah,
what is it?

639
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:00,282
Bureaucratic roadblocks.

640
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,945
When Bush Iimited stem cell
research to cell Iines
already established,

641
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,954
he essentially shut
down Graham's work.

642
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:08,582
What does that have to do
with Stephanie Rawley and
Audrey Logan?

643
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:09,784
Everything.

644
00:28:10,293 --> 00:28:13,922
He Iost his federal
funding and we had
to turn to private sources.

645
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:18,331
Which is Iegal,
but unfortunately
has strings attached.

646
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:20,062
What are you
talking about?

647
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:22,468
Do you know who
Davis Langley is?

648
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:23,870
BENSON: The software magnate?

649
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:26,102
He put up all the money.

650
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:30,277
I could have stopped him
but this is for
the greater good.

651
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:32,041
Where's the greater
good in rape?

652
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:34,283
They weren't raped.

653
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:36,510
They were inseminated.

654
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:41,379
Stephanie's parents
signed a blanket consent.

655
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,983
Did it mention
insemination in
the fine print?

656
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,085
It covered
experimental procedures.

657
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:49,988
I've done everything
conceivable to bring
her out of the coma.

658
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:52,728
This wasn't for her.
It was for an old,
sick billionaire.

659
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:54,827
I have done nothing wrong.

660
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:56,769
I didn't profit
from this in any way.

661
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,239
We'II be checking
your financials.

662
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:02,074
Look, do you have
any idea what Parkinson's
does to a body?

663
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,709
Any idea?

664
00:29:10,653 --> 00:29:11,642
I watched my

665
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:16,548
father slowly
deteriorate and then
die from the disease.

666
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,918
I couldn't do
a thing to stop it.

667
00:29:20,163 --> 00:29:22,688
Being a doctor,
that must have been
very frustrating for you.

668
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,393
It's why I became
a neurologist.

669
00:29:28,104 --> 00:29:30,766
I didn't want to
see anybody else
suffer the way he did.

670
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:32,196
(SIGHS)

671
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:34,910
I was just trying
to help Mr. Langley.

672
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:36,946
But the hell with
Audrey and Stephanie,
right?

673
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:38,873
Don't you get it?

674
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:41,644
Medical advances
have a price.

675
00:29:42,152 --> 00:29:45,918
Now, the first ten
bone marrow transplants
ended in death.

676
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:49,049
Now if we'd given up,
thousands of people
would have died.

677
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:51,286
Like they'II go on
dying from Parkinson's

678
00:29:51,361 --> 00:29:53,124
if you stop me
from doing my job.

679
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:54,857
Don't you get it?

680
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:56,421
You're going to jail.

681
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:57,989
I haven't broken
any Iaws.

682
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,331
You impregnated two girls
against their will.

683
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:02,598
What will?
They barely
have a pulse.

684
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:07,440
Audrey is in no
worse condition now
than she was before.

685
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,105
And I could have said the same
about Stephanie if you hadn't
stopped the procedure.

686
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:12,478
Oh, so now it's our fault.

687
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:15,609
AII I needed was a genetic
match for the stem cells

688
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:18,153
to be implanted into
Mr. Langley's brain.

689
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:22,287
It's still experimental,
but it's his only hope.

690
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,829
SCHOENFELD:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

691
00:30:33,336 --> 00:30:36,032
I'm Milton Schoenfeld,
Mr. Langley's attorney.

692
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,539
Well, since we're whipping
them out, this is AIex Cabot,
Assistant District Attorney.

693
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:43,711
What can I do for you?

694
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,248
Well, for starters,
you can produce your client.

695
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:48,546
Anything you have
to say to Mr. Langley,
you can say to me.

696
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:50,415
If there's anything
of interest,
I'II pass it along.

697
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:51,612
Of interest?

698
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:53,747
How about paying a woman
to be forcibly impregnated?

699
00:30:53,823 --> 00:30:57,554
Then conspiring to abort
the fetus and play
Frankenstein with the parts.

700
00:30:57,627 --> 00:31:00,061
Mr. Langley is not a doctor,
although he has consulted

701
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:02,290
several regarding
his condition.

702
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,768
He can't be held
responsible if any Iaws
were broken by one of them

703
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:07,166
without his knowledge.

704
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:09,933
Right, he had no idea why
he was jerking off into a cup.

705
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:13,942
He's given countless
specimens. BIood,
urine, tissue...

706
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,807
He couldn't tell you
what was done with those,
either.

707
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:19,212
So he wouldn't have
any trouble testifying
against Dr. Mandell.

708
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:21,773
I'm afraid his failing
health would prohibit that.

709
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:23,216
Oh, that's too bad,

710
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:26,119
because if there's one place
you don't want to be when
you're sick, it's Attica.

711
00:31:26,189 --> 00:31:29,784
My client has done nothing
illegal, so good Iuck getting
an indictment.

712
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:32,293
Otherwise,
don't bother us again.

713
00:31:34,831 --> 00:31:37,629
AIex. Hey,
how'd it go?

714
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,466
The grand jury
gave me both doctors,
but no-billed Langley.

715
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:44,472
Did they see
the three million dollar
check he wrote to Diotyne?

716
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,633
As a perfectly
Iegal donation.

717
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,336
That was payment
for stolen goods.

718
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:51,141
It doesn't even meet
the burden for a felony.

719
00:31:51,214 --> 00:31:53,341
Because it's illegal
to buy and sell body parts,

720
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,611
by Iaw they have
no monetary value.

721
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:57,846
You mean, I could go to jail
for stealing a toaster,

722
00:31:57,921 --> 00:31:59,946
but not for stealing
a woman's eggs?

723
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:02,856
Unfortunately,
the Iaw hasn't quite
caught up to the technology.

724
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:04,518
Well, what if
Dr. Mandell's
theory is right

725
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:07,688
and the procurement
of genetically matched
stem cells is the answer?

726
00:32:07,764 --> 00:32:09,664
Does that up
the ethical dilemma?

727
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:12,895
Mandell and Garrison
essentially raped a woman
with a turkey baster.

728
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:15,437
So, you've got
aggravated sex
abuse one.

729
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:18,440
Well, that's what I'm
going for, but they're gonna
argue no sexual gratification.

730
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:22,376
Every jury has a mother,
a daughter or a sister.
PIay the emotion card.

731
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,679
CABOT: Mrs. Rawley,
take your time.

732
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:31,082
MRS. RAWLEY:
Stephanie's been in a coma...

733
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:33,816
It'II be 14 months
next Tuesday.

734
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:39,792
And during that time,
has she ever regained
consciousness?

735
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,090
No. She's on Iife support.

736
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,726
Machines constantly
monitor her vital signs,

737
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:49,932
so there would be a record
if she had ever woken up,
even momentarily?

738
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:53,772
Oh, yes.
That hasn't happened. Yet.

739
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:58,941
So there is no way
she could have consented
to being impregnated

740
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:02,815
and then having her fetus
aborted by Dr. Mandell's
experimental procedure.

741
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:04,443
MRS. RAWLEY: Absolutely not.

742
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,616
And she would never
have agreed to that,
under any circumstances.

743
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:11,221
Do you ever
visit your daughter?

744
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:13,857
Every day.

745
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:18,056
I talk to her, read to her,

746
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:20,299
when her Iips are chapped, I

747
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:25,464
put ice chips on them.

748
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:29,076
But if Stephanie can't
communicate with you,

749
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:31,773
or with anyone else
for that matter,

750
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:35,010
why do you put
yourself through it?

751
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:39,581
Because I know she's still
in there somewhere.

752
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:43,724
People wake up from
comas all the time,
sometimes after years.

753
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:47,424
And I'm going to be
there when she does.

754
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:51,725
Thank you.

755
00:33:54,937 --> 00:33:57,201
Your daughter was
a very pretty girl.

756
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:00,840
She still is.

757
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:02,503
LANGAN: Kind person?

758
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,272
Ask anyone who
ever met her.

759
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:08,115
Sweetest girl
in the world.

760
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:09,776
What did she
do for a Iiving?

761
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:12,582
She graduated with honors,
she could've done anything,

762
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:15,180
but she chose to work with
special needs children.

763
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:18,588
I have a copy of her
driver's Iicense here.

764
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:21,761
She was an organ donor?

765
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:24,864
Yes.

766
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:30,099
She intended to spend
the rest of her Iife,
and after, helping people.

767
00:34:32,575 --> 00:34:33,599
Yes.

768
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:36,372
LANGAN: So,
would it be
fair to say,

769
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,248
considering her
circumstances,

770
00:34:39,315 --> 00:34:41,977
she might have
chosen to contribute

771
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:45,248
any way she could to help
the suffering of millions?

772
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:47,050
Stephanie Ioved children.

773
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:52,526
How dare you imply that
she would have created
a Iife just to have it

774
00:34:53,162 --> 00:34:56,996
destroyed by that monster.

775
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,164
We trusted you.

776
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:03,603
You promised you would do
everything you could for her.

777
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:08,975
Your job was to help
Stephanie, not use her
as a human petrie dish!

778
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:18,853
LANGAN: What good could
possibly have come from
this experimental procedure?

779
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:22,015
To start with,
the cure of Parkinson's.

780
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:24,956
From there,
treatment for AIzheimer's,

781
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:29,223
spinal cord injuries,
heart disease, diabetes.

782
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:31,161
How?

783
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,500
Well, I'm afraid
it's quite involved.

784
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,131
It's a culmination
of 15 years of my
own research,

785
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:42,940
not to mention
a century of experimentation
by countless others.

786
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:44,343
In a nutshell?

787
00:35:44,714 --> 00:35:50,880
The Holy Grail of
medical research.
Embryonic stem cells.

788
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:54,650
Now, unlike adult cells,
they have a

789
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:56,891
pluripotentiality.

790
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,324
In Iayman's terms?

791
00:35:58,394 --> 00:36:01,625
Well, these cells haven't
decided what they're going
to become yet.

792
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:07,795
Meaning we can coax them
to grow into any cell type
we need.

793
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,929
LANGAN: In the case
of Parkinson's?

794
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:14,909
The brain must produce
dopamine to control
muscle movement.

795
00:36:14,977 --> 00:36:20,313
In Parkinson's,
the basal ganglia cells
which produce this chemical

796
00:36:20,983 --> 00:36:23,884
start to degenerate and die.

797
00:36:24,754 --> 00:36:28,554
And it's our hope to
finally replace these
damaged neural cells.

798
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,789
Thank you.

799
00:36:32,428 --> 00:36:35,192
BENSON: Mandell
actually took the stand
in his own defense?

800
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:37,824
He still doesn't think
he did anything wrong.

801
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,424
So he hung himself.

802
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:41,299
Not if he reaches
even one juror

803
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,032
whose parent is dying
from Parkinson's
or AIzheimer's.

804
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:46,836
Well, they have no choice
if you made your case.

805
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,675
He Iost a Iot of ground
when he admitted he tried
to abort Stephanie.

806
00:36:50,746 --> 00:36:52,213
And I still
have my summation.

807
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:53,976
I'm afraid
there's going to be
a slight delay on that.

808
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,814
Sorry for the Iate notice,
but this witness
just became available.

809
00:36:56,886 --> 00:36:58,148
Who is it?

810
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:01,255
Well, he was too
sick to testify for us,

811
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:03,383
but it Iooks Iike
Davis Langley has made

812
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:05,586
a miraculous recovery
for the defense.

813
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,097
At the start it was
just my right hand.

814
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:15,930
My hand,
it was ice cold
all the time.

815
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,272
Then, my arm

816
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:24,973
stopped swinging
when I walked
and that was

817
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,681
six years ago.

818
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:31,746
Now, I...

819
00:37:33,522 --> 00:37:36,013
I can't even
brush my own teeth.

820
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:38,424
I can't button
my shirt.

821
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:41,857
I can't control
my bowels.

822
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:50,668
I piss in this bag,
for God's sake.

823
00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:55,606
I choke on my food.

824
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:59,943
I'm even afraid to
take a drink of water

825
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:06,183
because usually it
goes down the wrong pipe

826
00:38:07,156 --> 00:38:11,422
and causes havoc
in my Iungs.

827
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:14,719
I've had
pneumonia three times.

828
00:38:15,398 --> 00:38:17,866
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

829
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:20,902
And why did you choose
to come forward today,
Mr. Langley?

830
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,770
Because they're
prosecuting the wrong man.

831
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:32,606
Dr. Mandell fought
me tooth and nail.

832
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:38,143
He made it perfectly clear
that they had some success

833
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,658
with animal trials but they
were years away from humans.

834
00:38:44,593 --> 00:38:46,754
LANGAN: Why would you
put yourself at risk?

835
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:52,134
I haven't got five
more years to wait
for government approval.

836
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:59,002
At this point, I don't think
I've got five months.

837
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:06,206
Thank you.

838
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:12,378
Mr. Langley,

839
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:16,721
were you aware how
Dr. Mandell attempted
to procure stem cells for you?

840
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:19,886
Actually, it was my idea.

841
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:25,526
I wasn't aware you
had a medical degree,
Mr. Langley.

842
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:27,296
I don't,

843
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,864
but I read everything
there is out there
about the subject.

844
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:34,438
If they could create

845
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:40,671
a picture-perfect
genetically matched cell,

846
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,817
they could up the odds.

847
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:49,288
So, who cares if a comatose
woman is violated in the name
of science?

848
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:51,451
No, no.

849
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:54,963
My sympathy
to the family, but

850
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,898
their beautiful daughter
Ieft this earth a year ago.

851
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:05,199
But out of their tragedy
could come a gift of Iife

852
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:09,169
for many, many others.

853
00:40:10,312 --> 00:40:14,612
You have all
the money in the world.
Why not hire a surrogate?

854
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:22,221
Well, it's one thing
to carry a baby
for someone else,

855
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:25,590
it's quite another
to do what we needed.

856
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:32,397
I couldn't ask any woman
to knowingly carry
that burden.

857
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:37,664
Mr. Langley, are you aware
that you have just confessed

858
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,174
to being a co-conspirator
in this crime?

859
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,807
Young Iady, Iook at me.

860
00:40:46,582 --> 00:40:51,019
Prison couldn't compare
with what I'm facing now.

861
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,355
Even if it's
too Iate for me,

862
00:40:55,257 --> 00:40:57,782
it could end up
helping millions.

863
00:40:58,794 --> 00:41:02,525
I'm willing to
be the guinea pig.

864
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,793
PIease, Iet me
make it happen.

865
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:09,295
PIease.

866
00:41:20,883 --> 00:41:22,316
STABLER: Verdict came in.

867
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:25,545
BENSON: No.
They did not
Iet 'em off.

868
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:27,919
SIaps on the wrist.

869
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,289
The only charge
I got a guilty on was
the straight battery.

870
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,987
They tried to
steal a human fetus.

871
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:35,792
A guy in Jersey got
10 years for selling
stolen horse sperm.

872
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:39,357
Got no priors,
there's a chance Mandell
won't even see jail time.

873
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,835
There's just no precedent
for this kind of case yet.

874
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:45,369
Mrs. Rawley, I am so sorry
I could not do more.

875
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:49,575
You okay?
Can I get you
something?

876
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:52,311
You have got
to stop him.

877
00:41:52,381 --> 00:41:53,746
Stop who?

878
00:41:53,816 --> 00:41:57,149
Davis Langley just filed
for custody of the baby.

879
00:41:57,753 --> 00:42:00,415
He wants to take my
grandchild away from me.

880
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:03,086
He can't do that, can he?

881
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,824
His attorney says he is
the biological father,

882
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:08,830
that you just established
that for him in court.

883
00:42:08,898 --> 00:42:10,388
And he says that
biology always wins.

884
00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:11,990
Mrs. Rawley,
Iet's have a seat.

885
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:15,637
Let's just calm
down for a second,
come on over here.

886
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:18,264
I don't get it.

887
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,173
Why would Davis Langley
want custody of that baby?

888
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,770
Guilt?

889
00:42:24,113 --> 00:42:25,444
Survival.

890
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:29,742
If he's granted custody,
along with the baby
comes the umbilical cord.

891
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:32,548
I've cut four of them,
it's not exactly something
you save for the scrapbook.

892
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:35,613
Cord blood is chock
full of stem cells.

893
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:38,421
Half of which will be his
perfect genetic match.
