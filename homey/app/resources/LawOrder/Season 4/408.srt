1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:03,832
sexually based offenses are
considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:06,170
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

4
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:07,971
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:11,605
are members of an elite squad
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,376
These are their stories.

7
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:18,016
Hi, we're Iooking
for a patient,
Stephanie Rawley?

8
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:19,213
BENSON: Hey!

9
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:20,448
We don't have her.

10
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:22,047
STABLER: You sure?
She's a rape victim.

11
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,558
I haven't had
one all night.

12
00:00:23,626 --> 00:00:26,493
Call came from
this hospital,
just got it.

13
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:27,927
Well, maybe you
mixed up hospitals.

14
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:29,828
Maybe you could
check the computer.

15
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:33,062
Oh, well,
here's your miscom.

16
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:35,502
She's not in emergency.
She's in the ICU.

17
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,538
Good God.

18
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,372
What'd this guy
do to her?

19
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:43,139
Put her on
Iife support.

20
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,741
Beautiful girl.

21
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:49,148
He didn't touch that.
There's not
a mark on her face.

22
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:52,915
BENSON: No defense wounds,
either.

23
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,388
STABLER: BIitz attack
from behind?

24
00:00:54,824 --> 00:00:56,416
Knifepoint to the throat?

25
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:58,084
STABLER: Let's
check her chart.

26
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:59,560
She has pneumonia.

27
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:02,093
But she's out
of the woods.

28
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:04,065
We brought the fever
down with antibiotics.

29
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,566
Somebody called in a rape.

30
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,796
That was me.
I'm Dr. Sedaly.

31
00:01:08,538 --> 00:01:11,063
She was transferred here
from Mountcastle Rehab.

32
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,437
Drug overdose?

33
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:13,839
No, she was in
a car accident.

34
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,775
BENSON: When?
About a year ago.

35
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:18,905
She's been in
a persistent vegetative
state ever since.

36
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:22,576
Okay, she's been in a coma.
I don't understand why you
called us.

37
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:24,950
Because of the pneumonia,
I ordered a chest X-ray

38
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,455
and the Iab automatically
ran the standard tests.

39
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:28,683
Hers turned up positive.

40
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:29,986
For what?

41
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:32,823
A baby.
She's six weeks pregnant.

42
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:27,376
My daughter
was raped?

43
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,644
We should have
kept her at home.

44
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:30,686
I told you I could
take care of her.

45
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:32,812
Prayer wasn't going
to bring her back,
Janice.

46
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,516
Mountcastle was
our Iast hope.

47
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,818
How could they
Iet this happen?

48
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:37,154
I promise you,
we're going to find out.

49
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:40,252
Was Stephanie moved from
rehab for any reason,
say six, seven weeks ago?

50
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,523
No.

51
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:45,831
Check all of
Mountcastle's employees.
Anyone who had access.

52
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:48,496
Don't bother.
I know who did this.

53
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:49,765
Who?

54
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,967
It couldn't have been David,
he still has
a restraining order.

55
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,134
BENSON: Who's David?

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,576
The man Stephanie
was Iiving with.

57
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:58,079
The wreck was his fault.

58
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,944
Why is there
a restraining order?

59
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:03,008
After she went
into Mountcastle,
he tried to kill her.

60
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:10,151
I never tried to kill her.
I only told them her wishes.

61
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:11,352
Death wishes?

62
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:13,725
We Iived together for
six years. Yeah, we talked
about everything.

63
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:15,457
Stephanie never wanted
to Iive Iike this.

64
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:17,192
FIN: Ma and Pa catch you
tripping over the plug?

65
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,632
No, but they convinced
a judge I might.

66
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:22,234
I Iove her more than
anything in the world.

67
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:24,739
Really? How's your
sex Iife been Iately?

68
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,672
None of your business.
It is now.

69
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:30,845
If you two think...

70
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,746
You two are sick.

71
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,351
Besides, I haven't
seen her in months.

72
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,116
Call me a hopeless romantic,
but I don't see
a Iittle court order

73
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:42,657
standing in the way
of your undying Iove.

74
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,060
You don't know
her parents.

75
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:49,592
If it wasn't for them,
I'd have been there to
protect her from that pervert.

76
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:53,032
You blame them, even though
you're the one that put her
in a vegetable crisper?

77
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,133
It was my bachelor party.

78
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:04,278
The guys dragged me
off to a strip club
in Port Chester.

79
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:06,781
My friends got smashed,
so I called her
to come get me.

80
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,612
She drives out there,
you being a man,

81
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:11,482
had to take the wheel,
even though you'd had a few.

82
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:13,044
She never showed up.

83
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:17,217
She got hit by
a truck on the way.

84
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:20,728
MUNCH: He came across
pretty straight up.

85
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:23,788
FIN: We're not completely
ruling him out, but we're
thinking an inside job.

86
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:26,300
That's a big place.
Benson and Stabler
could use some help.

87
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:28,428
They're interviewing
the coma wing staff now.

88
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:30,870
I don't even want to think
how under-reported
coma rape is.

89
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,874
CRAGEN: Well, victims
don't tend to come forward.

90
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,910
Counselor, question.

91
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:38,276
What would it take
to blanket DNA
an entire facility?

92
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:40,008
A constitutional amendment.

93
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:42,277
But we know
the rape happened there.

94
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:45,286
It doesn't cover
probable cause for
each individual employee.

95
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:47,686
Not to mention patients,
vendors, visitors...

96
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:49,952
I mean, where would
your genetic dragnet end?

97
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,220
Whose side
are you on?

98
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,921
What about that
case in Germany?

99
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,120
11-year-old girl
was raped and killed,

100
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:57,791
they tested everybody
in the town.
Over 16,000 men.

101
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,767
But it was on
a strictly
volunteer basis.

102
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:01,063
I'II take volunteers.

103
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:04,106
It's still cost-prohibitive.
It's $600 a pop.

104
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:06,607
Who says they're all
gonna be processed?

105
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:09,304
I say we get
everybody's DNA now
while we've got 'em,

106
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:11,676
we can narrow down
the suspects Iater.

107
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:18,178
I gave your tech
a separate Iist of everyone
working six weeks ago,

108
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,586
including swing, graveyard
and weekend shifts.

109
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:23,181
We'II need to start
with the men who worked
directly with Stephanie.

110
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:26,717
At this point,
she's basically
receiving supportive care,

111
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:29,526
turned to prevent bedsores,
change IV tubes.

112
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:31,663
Mostly female nurses.

113
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:34,626
Except for CIark Jensen,
her physical therapist.

114
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:35,796
That should
make it easy.

115
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,965
Oh, and her neurologist,
Dr. Mandell.
He's her primary.

116
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,167
And where can
we find him?

117
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,573
He's with a patient.

118
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,042
STABLER: Catch you
at a bad time?

119
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:51,348
Not at all.
I'm just doing an LP.

120
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:52,952
Is that a
spinal tap?

121
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:55,923
She's having
unexplained
seizures

122
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:57,686
and since she can't
fill in the blanks,

123
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,058
I need to find out
what's going on.

124
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:03,659
Don't you normally
have a nurse present?

125
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,098
I'm an old hand at this.

126
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,794
STABLER: I meant
as a chaperone.

127
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,370
That policy isn't
for the patient,

128
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,101
it's to protect the doctor
from false allegations.

129
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:15,234
She can't make any.

130
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:17,211
Neither can
Stephanie Rawley.

131
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:19,105
And she has
a Iegitimate one.

132
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,879
Yeah, I can't tell you
how upset I was to hear that.

133
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:24,544
You examine her alone?

134
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:26,888
Often.

135
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,826
Stephanie's parents insist
that I repeat every test,

136
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:32,793
hoping there'II be
a change in her condition.

137
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:34,454
And what's
her prognosis?

138
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,931
Oh, it's very grim.
She's suffered
massive cortical damage.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,628
She has minimal
brain stem activity.

140
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:43,194
She has no intellectual
or motor function.

141
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:46,097
STABLER: Sounds Iike you
spent a Iot of time with her.

142
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,575
I spend time with
all my coma patients.

143
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:50,874
Would you have any problem
volunteering your DNA?

144
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:52,873
Not at all.

145
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,212
FIN: CIark Jensen?
Yes?

146
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,253
You do these exercises
with Stephanie Rawley?

147
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:03,087
Three times a week,
to keep the joints fluid and
the muscles from atrophying.

148
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:06,923
She's hooked to Iife support.
You roll those machines
up here?

149
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:09,988
I have a special routine
for the coma patients.
I can do them in their beds.

150
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,327
You don't say.

151
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:14,299
Two-minute break,
Mr. Crowe.

152
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:20,006
You happen to hear about
the voluntary DNA test?

153
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:22,505
I was the first in Iine.

154
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:24,375
You work with Stephanie a Iot.
Who do you think did it?

155
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:25,471
I don't know.

156
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:27,709
But I can't believe one
of my co-workers is a rapist.

157
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:29,410
What about a patient?
Or visitors.

158
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,043
You ever see this guy?

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,246
(SIGHS)

160
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,255
When?
Month or so ago.

161
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,791
I came in early one morning,
he was with her.

162
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:39,828
I knew the deal,
but when he told me
his side, I felt for the guy.

163
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:41,260
Didn't report it, though.

164
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,195
What exactly was he doing
when you walked in?

165
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,634
SIeeping in her bed.

166
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:50,604
You Iied to us,
Mr. Andersen.

167
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:52,768
I had to.

168
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,139
The second the Rawleys
find out I broke
the restraining order,

169
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,269
they'II have me arrested.

170
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:58,609
You Iooked me
right in the eye
and had the violins going...

171
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,172
I stayed away as Iong as
I could, then I started
visiting once a month.

172
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,514
Guess we all know
what you brought her
instead of flowers.

173
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:04,678
You're wrong.

174
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,120
How'd you manage
to sneak in there?

175
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,486
There's a nurse
on night shift.

176
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,286
She feels bad for me,
she Iooks the other way.

177
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:13,089
So you get to spend the night
with her in the moonlight,
just Iike old times, huh?

178
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:15,323
Naturally,
it got hot and heavy.

179
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,931
She gets agitated
at night.

180
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,962
She shakes,
her face twitches.

181
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:25,165
What do you do
about it, David?
I just hold her.

182
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,375
The doctors say
that she's not aware,

183
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:28,842
but it seems to
calm her down.

184
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:31,641
So you'd have no objections
then, to taking a paternity
test, huh?

185
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:32,738
None.

186
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,214
I want to know who did this
to her as much as you do.

187
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,212
BENSON: So far nobody has
a clue or has any problem
giving up their DNA.

188
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,690
FIN: Including the fiancé,
who was at
the top of our Iist.

189
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,817
Still headlining mine.

190
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:47,522
I think he's so Iovesick
he doesn't care whether
he goes to jail or not.

191
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,257
If that's the case,
why not just admit it?

192
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:50,696
Cause he's freaky sick.

193
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,291
I don't know.
They were gonna be
married in one week's time.

194
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,927
BENSON: Come on,
Iike that makes
a difference?

195
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,699
If she didn't give consent,
it's still rape.

196
00:08:56,772 --> 00:08:58,296
I'm saying she would've
if she could've.

197
00:08:58,374 --> 00:08:59,864
Fiancé, best case scenario.

198
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,775
It's not Iike she's facing
psychological trauma
over this. She's produce.

199
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:04,210
Mrs. Rawley.

200
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:07,942
Try to stay calm,
we're gonna be right there.

201
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,284
Mrs. Rawley went to mass
and when she came back,
Stephanie was gone.

202
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:13,378
Where is she?

203
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:16,583
Nurse said she'd been
transferred back to
the rehab center.

204
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,524
Why would they send her back
to where she was raped?

205
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,185
Where is she?
Look...

206
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:23,128
Tell me where she is!

207
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,723
STABLER: Mrs. Rawley,
Iet us handle this.

208
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:28,099
I want to see my daughter.
Right now.

209
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,138
I don't understand
what the problem is.

210
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,604
Was Stephanie
readmitted?

211
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:32,902
Yes, a few hours ago.

212
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:34,909
Don't tell me you put
her in the same room.

213
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:37,741
Well, yes,
but she isn't
there now.

214
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:39,542
Well, where is she?
The procedure room.

215
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:40,673
For what?

216
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:43,377
You're gonna have
to talk to Dr. Mandell,
he's the one who ordered it.

217
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,352
Ordered what?
What is he doing to her?

218
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:48,413
Mrs. Rawley,
do us a favor
and stay here.

219
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,987
BENSON: Dr. Mandell,
can we have
a word with you?

220
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,590
Hey, this is a sterile field.
Get out of here.

221
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,362
Who the hell are you?

222
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,063
Dr. Garrison.

223
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:03,729
Now, would you
please get out?

224
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,797
As soon as you tell us
what's going on here.

225
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:07,808
Just a routine procedure.

226
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,776
Dr. Mandell called me in.

227
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,646
To do what exactly?

228
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,938
Terminate the pregnancy.

229
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:22,523
I understand you just
interfered with
a medical emergency.

230
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,752
BENSON: What's that,
doc-talk for cover-up?

231
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,352
What are you
talking about?

232
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:29,659
You tried to destroy
evidence in a rape case
in which you're a suspect.

233
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:31,393
No wonder you were so willing
to give up your DNA.

234
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,935
You knew you could fix it
so there'd be
nothing to compare it to.

235
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:37,461
Look, all I knew was
that Stephanie Rawley's
Iife was in danger.

236
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,099
It's funny how the docs
at Wheaton Memorial
seemed to miss that.

237
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:44,339
Yes, well, they're not
experts in the care of
the profoundly devastated.

238
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,840
So you decide
to play God.

239
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:48,041
No, I called in
Dr. Garrison,

240
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:52,554
who agreed that it would
be malpractice to allow
the pregnancy to continue.

241
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:53,747
How very noble of you.

242
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:56,222
Except for the fact
that you failed to get
the parents' consent.

243
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,889
It's right here.
STABLER: That's crap.

244
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,296
Mrs. Rawley came to us,
hysterical, when she found out

245
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,799
Stephanie was
brought back here.

246
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,364
I dealt with Mr. Rawley.

247
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:12,306
I didn't know
what else to do.

248
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,304
I knew you'd
never consent.

249
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:15,570
Of course I wouldn't.

250
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:18,374
A sick pervert
raped our daughter.

251
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:20,608
I wanted that
monster out of her.

252
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:23,174
Was it Dr. Mandell's
idea or was it yours?

253
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:30,455
He called and told me
the risks of continuing
the pregnancy.

254
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:34,652
After all this,

255
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:37,598
I couldn't Iose
my daughter.

256
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,635
An abortion goes
against everything
that we believe in.

257
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,830
This is different.
It's Stephanie.

258
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,666
Do you want to raise
that thing inside her?

259
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,868
That thing is
our grandchild.

260
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,210
Why don't we
talk over here.

261
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,052
I'm a father, too.

262
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:02,422
What would you do?

263
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:05,721
I don't know.

264
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,498
I come visit every day
on my Iunch break.

265
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,358
With Mrs. Rawley?
No, alone.

266
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,496
What are you saying?

267
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:25,340
I'm sorry to
have to say this,
it's standard procedure,

268
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:26,904
but I should
get a DNA sample.

269
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:28,108
Robert!

270
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:31,909
You just assaulted
a police officer.

271
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,284
It's your call.

272
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:40,622
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

273
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:46,631
Questioning the father
as a suspect is never
a crowd-pleaser.

274
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:49,967
Verbal vitriol you'd expect,
anyone else think the father
protests a bit too much?

275
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:51,027
You're not a father.

276
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:53,904
You don't have a raped
daughter in a coma with
a devil cake in the oven.

277
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:55,375
That you just
tried to abort.

278
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:57,605
Well, we'II know if
it's Dad soon enough.

279
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,670
When do we get the products
of conception for testing?

280
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,511
STABLER: We don't.
They're keeping it.
FIN: Why?

281
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,845
Wife's Catholic.

282
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:05,478
Still, I've never had
a keeper with a stranger
rape before.

283
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:08,022
John, OIivia's mother
was raped by a stranger.

284
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,785
My mother
made a choice.

285
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:11,917
Look, OIivia,
we were just talking...

286
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:13,154
No, save it.

287
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:14,820
If the same thing
happened to me,

288
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:17,092
morning-after pill,
no question.

289
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,724
BENSON: So where
are we on the case?

290
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,099
No abortion,
no fetal tissue.
We're screwed.

291
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,661
We'II just have to
wait a couple of months
to start paternity tests.

292
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:25,400
Until then,
we'II work it
without DNA.

293
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:27,169
Where are we with
the rehab employees?

294
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:30,040
We ruled out a handful
with verifiable
medical reasons.

295
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:32,945
And we interviewed
everybody on the Iist
that volunteered their DNA.

296
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,983
I'm more interested
in anybody who refused.

297
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,608
That would be
two employees.

298
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,983
Okay, Iet's split up
and find out why.

299
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,752
SAMUEL: I know the drill.

300
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:45,385
Somebody committed a crime,
so Iet's check out
the black guy.

301
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,688
That stinks of
racial profiling.

302
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:47,956
We're Iooking
at everyone.

303
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,930
Where's your
probable cause?

304
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:51,556
What about a
search warrant?

305
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,329
This flies in the face
of the Fourth Amendment.

306
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,070
Mr. Hill, supplying
your DNA is voluntary.

307
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,538
No, it's not.

308
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:01,167
If you decide
not to volunteer,
you're presumed guilty.

309
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:02,870
I guess you're right.
So just ante up.

310
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:05,311
Hold on.
Mr. Hill has
a valid point.

311
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:10,348
Our Iikes, dislikes
and habits are all stored
in huge computer systems.

312
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:14,788
On top of that, you got
facial recognition technology,
public video surveillance.

313
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:16,916
National ID cards.
Where does it end?

314
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:18,983
Every piece of data
you put out there,

315
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,962
exponentially increases
the control The Man
wields over us.

316
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,261
I can see you understand
why this conversation
ends here.

317
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:26,596
Good day to you both.

318
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:30,331
Mr. Hill, if you didn't
rape Stephanie Rawley,
DNA can only exclude you.

319
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:31,838
We're off your back.

320
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,101
No.

321
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:36,943
Fascist pig.

322
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,373
What the hell was that?

323
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:43,410
Good police work.
Here's your DNA.

324
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:46,677
Well, what if I have a fatal
illness or something? Then I'd
know. I don't want to know.

325
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,484
We won't be testing
for any diseases.

326
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:51,025
But what if someone
gets ahold of the test,

327
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,061
finds out that I
do have a disease,
then denies me insurance?

328
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:54,425
I can't make all
those medical bills.

329
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:56,157
I assure you,
no one outside
the police department

330
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,528
will have access
to your DNA.

331
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,760
Once you exclude yourself,
it's destroyed.

332
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,799
Okay. AII right.

333
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:06,369
Well, what if I've committed
some crime in the past, huh?

334
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,341
Can you arrest me,
once you get ahold
of my DNA?

335
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,537
Have you committed
another crime?

336
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:12,045
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

337
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:15,606
No. But, you know.
Guys...

338
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:16,810
They make mistakes
all the time,

339
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:18,944
guys go to prison for years
before they figure it out.

340
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:23,185
Mr. Baltzer, if you don't
clear yourself, we're gonna
have to start digging around.

341
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:24,953
Why?
And asking questions.

342
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:26,392
Why?
Look, you had
access to the victim.

343
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:28,793
You were here alone,
at night, no witnesses.

344
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:30,388
No, no,
that's not true.

345
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:31,955
I am not here alone,
I swear.

346
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,228
There are a Iot of people
who wander these halls.

347
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:34,462
Like?

348
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:36,504
Like the vending guys,
the delivery men.

349
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,436
The fellow who
picks up the...

350
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,700
Picks up the what?

351
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,005
You know,

352
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,112
from the morgue.
The stiffs.

353
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,313
I get hungry.

354
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:54,583
The vending machines upstairs
have better selections.

355
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:55,353
Well, how do they compare
with the snacks in, say,
the coma wing?

356
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:57,418
I don't know.
I don't go there.

357
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,293
Oh, come on.
AII those nights
you've roamed the halls

358
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:03,698
jonesing for a Ding Dong fix,
you never once checked out
the coma wing?

359
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,201
What are you getting at?

360
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,865
Wesley, we're collecting DNA
from everyone who has contact
with the rehab.

361
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,805
We'd appreciate
your contribution.

362
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,502
No. No, I don't think so.

363
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:14,670
STABLER: Why not,
what's to hide?

364
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:18,477
I know how you cops operate.
You get a case,
you can't solve it,

365
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,781
you plant evidence,
make Wesley your fall guy.

366
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,185
Sounds Iike you've
had a run-in or two
with the police.

367
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:25,586
I don't have a record.

368
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:28,524
No, but we did find
a dropped complaint
against you.

369
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:29,890
Maxine Hatters?

370
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:31,487
Who the hell is that?

371
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:33,622
The woman you
assaulted a year ago.

372
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:35,222
The woman you
tried to choke.

373
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,226
She called the police?

374
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,166
She's Iucky I didn't
have her arrested.

375
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,869
You attacked her.
Why would you be
the one to press charges?

376
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:49,140
Because she
stole my wallet.

377
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,640
I only took it so
I could turn him in.

378
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,412
Creep tried
to strangle me.

379
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:56,113
That's a serious charge.
Why drop it?

380
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:58,087
I didn't Iike the way
I was being treated.

381
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:01,125
I tried to tell my story
and your boys in blue
put it back on me.

382
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:03,319
You want to tell us,
we'II Iisten.

383
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:07,160
So, I'm sitting in
this chicken joint,
Iike, 3:00 a.m.

384
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:10,429
This guy comes over,
starts asking me
about the chicken.

385
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:12,134
The chicken.
MAXINE: Yeah.

386
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:14,364
He offers to buy me some.
Some chicken?

387
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,237
Yeah. Only when we
get up to the motel
room to eat it...

388
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:18,900
Maxine, the guy's a john.

389
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:21,878
You're all alike. I'm a pro,
so it doesn't matter
he tried to kill me.

390
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:25,541
We don't care about your
night job, we're just trying
to get the story straight.

391
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:30,048
So we get up to
the motel room,
I ask him how he wants it,

392
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:34,182
I'm supposed to strip naked,
Iie flat on my back, not move
a muscle, not say a sound.

393
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:35,886
You got a problem
with that?
No.

394
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:38,924
He's the one who
had a Iittle problem,
if you know what I mean.

395
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:40,931
Okay, so you Iaughed at him,
he chokes you.

396
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:44,867
No, I was very understanding,
till he started
filling the tub with ice.

397
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:45,960
For what?

398
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:49,336
He told me to Iie in it.
I'm Iike, "No way."
That's when he chokes me.

399
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,671
He was trying to Iower
your body temperature.

400
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:55,269
Said he couldn't do it
unless I really seemed dead.

401
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:02,511
BENSON: You gotta
be kidding me.

402
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:05,715
Wesley, what is this thing
with you, water and women?

403
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:07,888
I'm just doing my job.

404
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,086
I mean, the hot showers I get,
but ice baths?

405
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:11,560
We tracked down Maxine.

406
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,088
Your old prostitute.

407
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:16,463
The one you hired
to pretend to be
pretty much Iike her.

408
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:18,092
I heard you
weren't real happy
with her performance.

409
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:20,137
How'd Stephanie Rawley do?

410
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,833
I told you, I've never
been to the coma wing.

411
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:26,303
Could you please go?
You're gonna get me fired.

412
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:27,639
Oh, we wouldn't
want to do that,

413
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,873
seeing as you've
only been here for,
what, a couple of months?

414
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:32,382
Before that you were at

415
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,514
Upson Funeral Home.

416
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:38,579
What went wrong there?

417
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:39,816
Nothing.

418
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,894
No, Wesley was great.
It was just time
for him to move on.

419
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,260
After seven weeks.

420
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:47,491
Yes.

421
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,159
Uh-huh.

422
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:52,794
Ma'am, just so you know,
the Federal Trade Commission

423
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,738
no Ionger requires you
to buy your casket
at the funeral home.

424
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,275
You can save a few thousand
by buying from the supplier.

425
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:02,177
Not when you take into account
the discount package I'II be
offering you.

426
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:04,408
I'II be right back
to discuss that.

427
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,782
I assume you gave
her the price Iist,
as required by Iaw?

428
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:10,412
AII right.
We had some thefts.

429
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:14,982
Some jewelry,
a few gold fillings,
so we installed a camera.

430
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,118
We're not here
about grave robbing.

431
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:19,095
Well, Wesley wasn't
our thief.

432
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:21,397
But I'm afraid we
did catch him on tape.

433
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:22,933
Doing what?

434
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:25,964
The Iate Mrs. Thurgeston.

435
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:30,466
Kind of Iate to be
paying your respects,
isn't it?

436
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,271
STABLER: Guess
you two were close.

437
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:34,370
Really close.

438
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:35,673
You Iike
the quiet type, huh?

439
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,646
PIease turn it off.

440
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:41,082
Oh, relax,
it's over in a second.

441
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:44,386
Ah, but I guess I don't
have to tell you that.

442
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:46,150
WESLEY: Can I please
have a glass of water?

443
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:47,851
(KNOCKING)
BENSON: Heavy on the ice,
right?

444
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,329
BENSON: He's got dry mouth.

445
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:54,763
At Ieast we're
making him nervous.

446
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,629
HUANG: Yeah,
you more than EIIiot.

447
00:19:57,268 --> 00:20:00,499
He's a necrophiliac.
His greatest fear
is to be judged by women.

448
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:03,632
The emasculation
tactic might not be
the way to go on this one.

449
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,834
That's why we
pulled you out.

450
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:05,967
What are you
thinking?

451
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:08,012
Shame is driving
his compulsion.

452
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,411
He was most Iikely
raised in an overly
religious household,

453
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:12,915
where an intense
degree of shame
was attached to sex.

454
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:15,817
So what are we thinking?
Empathize?

455
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:17,218
Tell him that
we understand?

456
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:19,820
I doubt that
he understands.

457
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:24,254
Pretty girl, isn't she?

458
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:27,423
I guess.

459
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,861
AImost Iike SIeeping Beauty
and she's been
in a coma for a year.

460
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:34,135
Look, I've never
seen her before.

461
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:36,673
Come on, Wesley,
I understand.
I'm a guy.

462
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,536
Hard opportunity to pass up.

463
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,078
It's not Iike she
knew what was going on.

464
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,203
You don't understand.

465
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,578
I do, more than you think.
It's what every guy wants.

466
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:46,580
No one judging you...

467
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:48,542
Right.

468
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,384
Just Stephanie
Iying there perfect.
Deaf, dumb and blind.

469
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:52,889
No, it doesn't
work that way.

470
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:53,981
Why doesn't it
work that way?

471
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:55,491
She's alive.
Come on!

472
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,892
Don't split hairs with me,
Wesley! Come on!

473
00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:59,862
People snap out of
comas all the time.

474
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:02,627
Well, what about the hooker
that you hired, huh?

475
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,361
She was alive
and kicking, pal.

476
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,666
And I bet she told you
what a miserable failure
I was.

477
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:10,264
Yes, she did.
And we had a big
Iaugh at your expense.

478
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,499
I knew she'd talk.

479
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:14,010
(SNIFFING)

480
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:16,342
You can't trust
a woman with a pulse.

481
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,678
CRAGEN: Get him his water.

482
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:24,188
Okay, but I don't see
this guy giving it up,
whether I'm in there or not.

483
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,054
HUANG: What if there's
nothing to give up?

484
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:28,115
Obviously we weren't
watching the same tape.

485
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,161
I'm just saying,
there are some extreme
cases where a necrophiliac

486
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:33,595
can't sustain the arousal
required to penetrate,

487
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:35,656
Iet alone impregnate,
a warm body.

488
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:37,526
So, you don't
need me after all.

489
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:38,626
No, hold on.

490
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:41,001
The only thing
rendering Mr. Dilbert Iimp

491
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:44,599
is the 12-to-25 he's facing
on rape one as opposed to...

492
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:46,303
What does
necrophilia get him?

493
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:47,571
Sexual misconduct.

494
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:49,738
A misdemeanor.
Great. One year, max.

495
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:51,839
CABOT: Is there anything
that Iinks him to Stephanie?

496
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,009
Any witnesses,
physical evidence?

497
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:56,349
We'II have paternity
in two months.

498
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:59,356
Well, at the very Ieast,
Iet's save the Iate
Mrs. Thurgeston

499
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,085
another spin in her grave.

500
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:04,161
We'II charge him
with necrophilia,
get him off the street.

501
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:12,167
"Docket number 269501.
People vs. Dilbert.

502

"Sexual misconduct
130.20 sub 3."

503
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:17,598
Sub 3?

504
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:19,165
Which one is it, Counselor?

505
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:22,679
Was the sexual conduct
with an animal or
a dead human body?

506
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:25,409
Mr. Dilbert is a funeral home
attendant who was videotaped

507
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,610
having sex with
a human corpse.

508
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:29,283
COHEN: Your plea, Mr. Dilbert?

509
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:30,582
Not guilty, Your Honor.

510
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:32,020
I'II hear from
the People on bail.

511
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,182
$100,000.

512
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:34,747
COHEN: For an A misdemeanor?

513
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,953
CABOT: He has insufficient
community ties,

514
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:39,792
poses an ongoing threat,
and, we believe,
is a flight risk.

515
00:22:39,864 --> 00:22:42,833
He has Iimited
financial means,
no criminal record,

516
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,630
and given
the non-violent crime
he's been charged with,

517
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:47,534
I see no threat
to the community.

518
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:49,971
Your honor, Mr. Dilbert
is the number-one suspect

519
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,736
in the rape of
a comatose patient.

520
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:54,300
We believe this heightens
the flight risk considerably.

521
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:57,177
I'm sorry, I don't see
an indictment on that charge.

522
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:58,340
You will.

523
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:02,443
Until I do, His Honor
cannot possibly consider
it in determining bail.

524
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,112
Request ROR.

525
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:06,785
Bail's set at $5,000.

526
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:09,824
So he'II be
out by morning.

527
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:12,328
Free to ruin
someone else's
daughter.

528
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:14,524
Why couldn't you charge him
with Stephanie's rape?

529
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,294
We don't have enough
evidence to support it yet.

530
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:17,595
Mr. RAWLEY: When will you?

531
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:20,136
We need the fetus' DNA
to determine paternity.

532
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:22,934
The earliest an amnio
can be done is 14 weeks.

533
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,474
That's almost two months.

534
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:26,772
They could have it now
if they had the tissue.

535
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:29,209
That's not an option.

536
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,770
HUANG: You know,
I may have one for you.

537
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:32,543
Dr. Huang is familiar
with the case.

538
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:35,347
With amniocentesis,
as with chorionic
villus sampling,

539
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,684
there's always
a chance of miscarriage
or other complications.

540
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:38,813
Oh, my God.

541
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,051
HUANG: That's why they've
been experimenting
with alternative testing.

542
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,026
A colleague of mine,
a forensic gynecologist,
has been successful

543
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:47,496
in adapting the alternative
to determine early prenatal
paternity.

544
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:54,431
BENSON: So what did
you get for us?

545
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:56,700
Well, we took 30 cc
of Stephanie's blood

546
00:23:56,774 --> 00:24:00,141
and we subjected it to density
gradient centrifugation

547
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:02,236
to remove the maternal
non-nucleated
red blood cells.

548
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:03,337
HUANG: Leaving you only
with the fetal cells.

549
00:24:03,414 --> 00:24:04,403
So, did it work?

550
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:06,780
Well, mind you,
even during
the optimal period,

551
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:10,412
the frequency of fetal cells
in maternal blood is
only one in ten million.

552
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:13,423
Luckily, we have this
high-precision magnetic
cell-separation technology.

553
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:15,425
BENSON: So, did it
work or not?
Yes.

554
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:18,121
Did you compare it to Wesley
the Necro's DNA sample?

555
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:20,562
There was no need.
The fetus' blood type is AB.

556
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:22,360
The mother's is type A,
which means...

557
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:23,661
The father can
only be type B.

558
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:26,794
And Wesley is type A.
So, he cannot be the father.

559
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:28,099
That's right.

560
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:29,230
Damn it.

561
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:31,673
We have those other
volunteered samples to run.
How many are type B?

562
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:35,508
Well, not the fiancé,
not Mr. Riley,

563
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:38,476
not the night custodian,

564
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:40,208
not him...

565
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:42,012
Hello.

566
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:44,679
Look who we have here.

567
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:49,993
Do you have any idea how many
people have type B blood?

568
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,120
One in ten.
We did our homework.

569
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:54,426
And you're the only
one who had type B

570
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:56,933
and had access
and tried to
abort the evidence.

571
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,936
Doc, you just keep
popping up on our
radar screen.

572
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:01,301
Now what are we
supposed to think?

573
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:03,602
Well, fortunately,
you don't have to.

574
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:09,078
Modern technology has removed
that burden. You have my DNA,
just run it.

575
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:10,773
Well, we'II get the results
back in a few days.

576
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:13,942
The problem is, you make us
wait till then, we're gonna
be in no mood to bargain.

577
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,219
I think I'II
take my chances.

578
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:18,677
(KNOCKING)

579
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:22,824
BENSON: Why, Dr. Huang.
What brings you here?

580
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:25,761
Some fascinating results
from the gynecological
examinations

581
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,391
performed on Dr. Mandell's
other female coma patients.

582
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,935
These are forensic pictures
taken with a culposcope

583
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:34,870
of the uterine walls
of your patient,
Audrey Logan.

584
00:25:35,306 --> 00:25:37,240
Dr. Mandell,
help us out here.

585
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:41,038
What's your diagnosis?

586
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:43,103
I'm not a trained OB/GYN.

587
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:46,641
Come on,
we all did gynecology
in med school.

588
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:48,648
Give it a shot.

589
00:25:53,024 --> 00:25:54,822
Well, it Iooks Iike
a healthy uterus, no

590
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:59,796
signs of endometriosis,
no polyps, no cysts.

591
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:03,301
Well, it does take
a trained eye, but if
you notice right there,

592
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:05,165
there's miniscule scarring.

593
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:06,966
STABLER:
From a sexual assault?

594
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,837
No. I'd say more Iikely
from a recent abortion.

595
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:12,868
So, you raped her, too.

596
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,676
And got rid of the evidence.

597
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:17,672
I need to speak
with my attorney.

598
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:24,917
Doc Mandell took
care of both women.

599
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,323
We know he tried to abort
Stephanie's fetus,
he's not copping to the other.

600
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:31,123
Well, what do we know
about raped coma victim
number two?

601
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,298
Audrey Logan, captain of her
high school debate team

602
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:38,268
until she went to a rave
three years ago and ingested
one too many party favors.

603
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:40,362
Yeah, now she's captain
of the drool team.

604
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:41,667
Fin went to get
her medical records.

605
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,571
What have you
dug up on the doc?

606
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:46,110
No dirt, per se, yet,
but Iisten to this.

607
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:48,942
Turns out he works
two days a week
at a place called Diotyne.

608
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:50,709
Bio-tech company.

609
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:52,079
What does he
do there?

610
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:53,709
Parkinson's research.

611
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:55,412
Well, it make sense.
He's a neurologist.

612
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:57,385
CRAGEN: Audrey's
medical files?

613
00:26:57,456 --> 00:26:59,424
No record of an abortion
and the only operation

614
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:02,221
was for an ovarian cyst
removed four months ago.

615
00:27:02,294 --> 00:27:04,194
Time frame fits
with the scarring.

616
00:27:04,262 --> 00:27:05,729
FIN: Guess who the OB/GYN was.

617
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,162
Dr. Garrison.

618
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:09,598
That's the same woman
Mandell brought in to
abort Stephanie.

619
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:11,659
I think it's time we
invite her in for a chat.

620
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:13,102
FIN: Tried, she wasn't
at the hospital.

621
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,934
She works for some
research Iab called...

622
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:16,406
Diotyne?

623
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:19,302
How do you know?

624
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,312
Just a crazy hunch.

625
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:25,876
My relationship with
Dr. Mandell is none
of your business.

626
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:28,715
He's in a Iot of trouble,
Dr. Garrison.
And he's dragged you into it.

627
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:31,017
Dr. Mandell hasn't
dragged me into anything.

628
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:33,088
You're awfully
accommodating.

629
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:35,952
How's it work?
He rapes 'em,
you scrape 'em?

630
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:37,620
He's not a rapist.

631
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:42,193
As I explained,
Stephanie's Iife was,
and is, at risk.

632
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,427
BENSON: And what about
Audrey Logan?

633
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:45,333
You did a good job
removing her cyst.

634
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:48,038
Didn't even Ieave
a scar on her ovary.

635
00:27:48,106 --> 00:27:49,835
But you did Ieave
one on her uterus.

636
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:51,637
How do you
explain that?

637
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:53,811
It's not what you think.

638
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,247
Oh, yeah,
what is it?

639
00:27:56,314 --> 00:27:58,282
Bureaucratic roadblocks.

640
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,945
When Bush Iimited stem cell
research to cell Iines
already established,

641
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,954
he essentially shut
down Graham's work.

642
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:06,582
What does that have to do
with Stephanie Rawley and
Audrey Logan?

643
00:28:06,658 --> 00:28:07,784
Everything.

644
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:11,922
He Iost his federal
funding and we had
to turn to private sources.

645
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:16,331
Which is Iegal,
but unfortunately
has strings attached.

646
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:18,062
What are you
talking about?

647
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:20,468
Do you know who
Davis Langley is?

648
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:21,870
BENSON: The software magnate?

649
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:24,102
He put up all the money.

650
00:28:24,443 --> 00:28:28,277
I could have stopped him
but this is for
the greater good.

651
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:30,041
Where's the greater
good in rape?

652
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:32,283
They weren't raped.

653
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:34,510
They were inseminated.

654
00:28:36,888 --> 00:28:39,379
Stephanie's parents
signed a blanket consent.

655
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,983
Did it mention
insemination in
the fine print?

656
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,085
It covered
experimental procedures.

657
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:47,988
I've done everything
conceivable to bring
her out of the coma.

658
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:50,728
This wasn't for her.
It was for an old,
sick billionaire.

659
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:52,827
I have done nothing wrong.

660
00:28:52,904 --> 00:28:54,769
I didn't profit
from this in any way.

661
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,239
We'II be checking
your financials.

662
00:28:56,308 --> 00:29:00,074
Look, do you have
any idea what Parkinson's
does to a body?

663
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:03,709
Any idea?

664
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:09,642
I watched my

665
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:14,548
father slowly
deteriorate and then
die from the disease.

666
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,918
I couldn't do
a thing to stop it.

667
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:20,688
Being a doctor,
that must have been
very frustrating for you.

668
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:25,393
It's why I became
a neurologist.

669
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:28,766
I didn't want to
see anybody else
suffer the way he did.

670
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:30,196
(SIGHS)

671
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:32,910
I was just trying
to help Mr. Langley.

672
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:34,946
But the hell with
Audrey and Stephanie,
right?

673
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:36,873
Don't you get it?

674
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:39,644
Medical advances
have a price.

675
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:43,918
Now, the first ten
bone marrow transplants
ended in death.

676
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:47,049
Now if we'd given up,
thousands of people
would have died.

677
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,286
Like they'II go on
dying from Parkinson's

678
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:51,124
if you stop me
from doing my job.

679
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:52,857
Don't you get it?

680
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:54,421
You're going to jail.

681
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:55,989
I haven't broken
any Iaws.

682
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:58,331
You impregnated two girls
against their will.

683
00:29:58,403 --> 00:30:00,598
What will?
They barely
have a pulse.

684
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:05,440
Audrey is in no
worse condition now
than she was before.

685
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,105
And I could have said the same
about Stephanie if you hadn't
stopped the procedure.

686
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:10,478
Oh, so now it's our fault.

687
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:13,609
AII I needed was a genetic
match for the stem cells

688
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:16,153
to be implanted into
Mr. Langley's brain.

689
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:20,287
It's still experimental,
but it's his only hope.

690
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,829
SCHOENFELD:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

691
00:30:31,336 --> 00:30:34,032
I'm Milton Schoenfeld,
Mr. Langley's attorney.

692
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,539
Well, since we're whipping
them out, this is AIex Cabot,
Assistant District Attorney.

693
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:41,711
What can I do for you?

694
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,248
Well, for starters,
you can produce your client.

695
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:46,546
Anything you have
to say to Mr. Langley,
you can say to me.

696
00:30:46,618 --> 00:30:48,415
If there's anything
of interest,
I'II pass it along.

697
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:49,612
Of interest?

698
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:51,747
How about paying a woman
to be forcibly impregnated?

699
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:53,554
Then conspiring to abort
the fetus and play
Frankenstein with the parts.

700
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:56,061
Mr. Langley is not a doctor,
although he has consulted

701
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:58,290
several regarding
his condition.

702
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,768
He can't be held
responsible if any Iaws
were broken by one of them

703
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:03,166
without his knowledge.

704
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,933
Right, he had no idea why
he was jerking off into a cup.

705
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:09,942
He's given countless
specimens. BIood,
urine, tissue...

706
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,807
He couldn't tell you
what was done with those,
either.

707
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:15,212
So he wouldn't have
any trouble testifying
against Dr. Mandell.

708
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:17,773
I'm afraid his failing
health would prohibit that.

709
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:19,216
Oh, that's too bad,

710
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:22,119
because if there's one place
you don't want to be when
you're sick, it's Attica.

711
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:25,784
My client has done nothing
illegal, so good Iuck getting
an indictment.

712
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:28,293
Otherwise,
don't bother us again.

713
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:33,629
AIex. Hey,
how'd it go?

714
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,466
The grand jury
gave me both doctors,
but no-billed Langley.

715
00:31:37,537 --> 00:31:40,472
Did they see
the three million dollar
check he wrote to Diotyne?

716
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,633
As a perfectly
Iegal donation.

717
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,336
That was payment
for stolen goods.

718
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:47,141
It doesn't even meet
the burden for a felony.

719
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:49,341
Because it's illegal
to buy and sell body parts,

720
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:51,611
by Iaw they have
no monetary value.

721
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:53,846
You mean, I could go to jail
for stealing a toaster,

722
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:55,946
but not for stealing
a woman's eggs?

723
00:31:56,023 --> 00:31:58,856
Unfortunately,
the Iaw hasn't quite
caught up to the technology.

724
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:00,518
Well, what if
Dr. Mandell's
theory is right

725
00:32:00,594 --> 00:32:03,688
and the procurement
of genetically matched
stem cells is the answer?

726
00:32:03,764 --> 00:32:05,664
Does that up
the ethical dilemma?

727
00:32:05,732 --> 00:32:08,895
Mandell and Garrison
essentially raped a woman
with a turkey baster.

728
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,437
So, you've got
aggravated sex
abuse one.

729
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:14,440
Well, that's what I'm
going for, but they're gonna
argue no sexual gratification.

730
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:18,376
Every jury has a mother,
a daughter or a sister.
PIay the emotion card.

731
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:23,679
CABOT: Mrs. Rawley,
take your time.

732
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,082
MRS. RAWLEY:
Stephanie's been in a coma...

733
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,816
It'II be 14 months
next Tuesday.

734
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:35,792
And during that time,
has she ever regained
consciousness?

735
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,090
No. She's on Iife support.

736
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,726
Machines constantly
monitor her vital signs,

737
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:45,932
so there would be a record
if she had ever woken up,
even momentarily?

738
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,772
Oh, yes.
That hasn't happened. Yet.

739
00:32:50,777 --> 00:32:54,941
So there is no way
she could have consented
to being impregnated

740
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:58,815
and then having her fetus
aborted by Dr. Mandell's
experimental procedure.

741
00:32:58,885 --> 00:33:00,443
MRS. RAWLEY: Absolutely not.

742
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,616
And she would never
have agreed to that,
under any circumstances.

743
00:33:05,492 --> 00:33:07,221
Do you ever
visit your daughter?

744
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:09,857
Every day.

745
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,056
I talk to her, read to her,

746
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:16,299
when her Iips are chapped, I

747
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:21,464
put ice chips on them.

748
00:33:23,176 --> 00:33:25,076
But if Stephanie can't
communicate with you,

749
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:27,773
or with anyone else
for that matter,

750
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:31,010
why do you put
yourself through it?

751
00:33:32,953 --> 00:33:35,581
Because I know she's still
in there somewhere.

752
00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:39,724
People wake up from
comas all the time,
sometimes after years.

753
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:43,424
And I'm going to be
there when she does.

754
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:47,725
Thank you.

755
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:53,201
Your daughter was
a very pretty girl.

756
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:56,840
She still is.

757
00:33:57,377 --> 00:33:58,503
LANGAN: Kind person?

758
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:01,272
Ask anyone who
ever met her.

759
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:04,115
Sweetest girl
in the world.

760
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:05,776
What did she
do for a Iiving?

761
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:08,582
She graduated with honors,
she could've done anything,

762
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:11,180
but she chose to work with
special needs children.

763
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:14,588
I have a copy of her
driver's Iicense here.

764
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:17,761
She was an organ donor?

765
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:20,864
Yes.

766
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:26,099
She intended to spend
the rest of her Iife,
and after, helping people.

767
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:29,599
Yes.

768
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:32,372
LANGAN: So,
would it be
fair to say,

769
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,248
considering her
circumstances,

770
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:37,977
she might have
chosen to contribute

771
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:41,248
any way she could to help
the suffering of millions?

772
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:43,050
Stephanie Ioved children.

773
00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:48,526
How dare you imply that
she would have created
a Iife just to have it

774
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:52,996
destroyed by that monster.

775
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:56,164
We trusted you.

776
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:59,603
You promised you would do
everything you could for her.

777
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:04,975
Your job was to help
Stephanie, not use her
as a human petrie dish!

778
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:14,853
LANGAN: What good could
possibly have come from
this experimental procedure?

779
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:18,015
To start with,
the cure of Parkinson's.

780
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,956
From there,
treatment for AIzheimer's,

781
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:25,223
spinal cord injuries,
heart disease, diabetes.

782
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:27,161
How?

783
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,500
Well, I'm afraid
it's quite involved.

784
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,131
It's a culmination
of 15 years of my
own research,

785
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:38,940
not to mention
a century of experimentation
by countless others.

786
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,343
In a nutshell?

787
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:46,880
The Holy Grail of
medical research.
Embryonic stem cells.

788
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:50,650
Now, unlike adult cells,
they have a

789
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:50,891
pluripotentiality.

790
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,324
In Iayman's terms?

791
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:55,625
Well, these cells haven't
decided what they're going
to become yet.

792
00:35:55,697 --> 00:36:01,795
Meaning we can coax them
to grow into any cell type
we need.

793
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,929
LANGAN: In the case
of Parkinson's?

794
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:08,909
The brain must produce
dopamine to control
muscle movement.

795
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:14,313
In Parkinson's,
the basal ganglia cells
which produce this chemical

796
00:36:14,983 --> 00:36:17,884
start to degenerate and die.

797
00:36:18,754 --> 00:36:22,554
And it's our hope to
finally replace these
damaged neural cells.

798
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:24,789
Thank you.

799
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:29,192
BENSON: Mandell
actually took the stand
in his own defense?

800
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:31,824
He still doesn't think
he did anything wrong.

801
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,424
So he hung himself.

802
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:35,299
Not if he reaches
even one juror

803
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,032
whose parent is dying
from Parkinson's
or AIzheimer's.

804
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:40,836
Well, they have no choice
if you made your case.

805
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,675
He Iost a Iot of ground
when he admitted he tried
to abort Stephanie.

806
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:46,213
And I still
have my summation.

807
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:47,976
I'm afraid
there's going to be
a slight delay on that.

808
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,814
Sorry for the Iate notice,
but this witness
just became available.

809
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:52,148
Who is it?

810
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:55,255
Well, he was too
sick to testify for us,

811
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:57,383
but it Iooks Iike
Davis Langley has made

812
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:59,586
a miraculous recovery
for the defense.

813
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,097
At the start it was
just my right hand.

814
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:09,930
My hand,
it was ice cold
all the time.

815
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,272
Then, my arm

816
00:37:15,344 --> 00:37:18,973
stopped swinging
when I walked
and that was

817
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,681
six years ago.

818
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,746
Now, I...

819
00:37:27,522 --> 00:37:30,013
I can't even
brush my own teeth.

820
00:37:30,092 --> 00:37:32,424
I can't button
my shirt.

821
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:35,857
I can't control
my bowels.

822
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:44,668
I piss in this bag,
for God's sake.

823
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:49,606
I choke on my food.

824
00:37:51,213 --> 00:37:53,943
I'm even afraid to
take a drink of water

825
00:37:54,916 --> 00:38:00,183
because usually it
goes down the wrong pipe

826
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:05,422
and causes havoc
in my Iungs.

827
00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:08,719
I've had
pneumonia three times.

828
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:11,866
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

829
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:14,902
And why did you choose
to come forward today,
Mr. Langley?

830
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,770
Because they're
prosecuting the wrong man.

831
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:26,606
Dr. Mandell fought
me tooth and nail.

832
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:32,143
He made it perfectly clear
that they had some success

833
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,658
with animal trials but they
were years away from humans.

834
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:40,754
LANGAN: Why would you
put yourself at risk?

835
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:46,134
I haven't got five
more years to wait
for government approval.

836
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:53,002
At this point, I don't think
I've got five months.

837
00:38:59,114 --> 00:39:00,206
Thank you.

838
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:06,378
Mr. Langley,

839
00:39:06,455 --> 00:39:10,721
were you aware how
Dr. Mandell attempted
to procure stem cells for you?

840
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:13,886
Actually, it was my idea.

841
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:19,526
I wasn't aware you
had a medical degree,
Mr. Langley.

842
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:21,296
I don't,

843
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,864
but I read everything
there is out there
about the subject.

844
00:39:26,675 --> 00:39:28,438
If they could create

845
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:34,671
a picture-perfect
genetically matched cell,

846
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,817
they could up the odds.

847
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:43,288
So, who cares if a comatose
woman is violated in the name
of science?

848
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:45,451
No, no.

849
00:39:45,527 --> 00:39:48,963
My sympathy
to the family, but

850
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,898
their beautiful daughter
Ieft this earth a year ago.

851
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:59,199
But out of their tragedy
could come a gift of Iife

852
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:03,169
for many, many others.

853
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:08,612
You have all
the money in the world.
Why not hire a surrogate?

854
00:40:09,918 --> 00:40:16,221
Well, it's one thing
to carry a baby
for someone else,

855
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:19,590
it's quite another
to do what we needed.

856
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:26,397
I couldn't ask any woman
to knowingly carry
that burden.

857
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:31,664
Mr. Langley, are you aware
that you have just confessed

858
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,174
to being a co-conspirator
in this crime?

859
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,807
Young Iady, Iook at me.

860
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:45,019
Prison couldn't compare
with what I'm facing now.

861
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:48,355
Even if it's
too Iate for me,

862
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:51,782
it could end up
helping millions.

863
00:40:52,794 --> 00:40:56,525
I'm willing to
be the guinea pig.

864
00:40:57,232 --> 00:41:00,793
PIease, Iet me
make it happen.

865
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:03,295
PIease.

866
00:41:14,883 --> 00:41:16,316
STABLER: Verdict came in.

867
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:19,545
BENSON: No.
They did not
Iet 'em off.

868
00:41:20,622 --> 00:41:21,919
SIaps on the wrist.

869
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,289
The only charge
I got a guilty on was
the straight battery.

870
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,987
They tried to
steal a human fetus.

871
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:29,792
A guy in Jersey got
10 years for selling
stolen horse sperm.

872
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:33,357
Got no priors,
there's a chance Mandell
won't even see jail time.

873
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:35,835
There's just no precedent
for this kind of case yet.

874
00:41:36,605 --> 00:41:39,369
Mrs. Rawley, I am so sorry
I could not do more.

875
00:41:41,243 --> 00:41:43,575
You okay?
Can I get you
something?

876
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:46,311
You have got
to stop him.

877
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:47,746
Stop who?

878
00:41:47,816 --> 00:41:51,149
Davis Langley just filed
for custody of the baby.

879
00:41:51,753 --> 00:41:54,415
He wants to take my
grandchild away from me.

880
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:57,086
He can't do that, can he?

881
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,824
His attorney says he is
the biological father,

882
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,830
that you just established
that for him in court.

883
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:04,388
And he says that
biology always wins.

884
00:42:04,466 --> 00:42:05,990
Mrs. Rawley,
Iet's have a seat.

885
00:42:06,668 --> 00:42:09,637
Let's just calm
down for a second,
come on over here.

886
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:12,264
I don't get it.

887
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,173
Why would Davis Langley
want custody of that baby?

888
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,770
Guilt?

889
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:19,444
Survival.

890
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:23,742
If he's granted custody,
along with the baby
comes the umbilical cord.

891
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:26,548
I've cut four of them,
it's not exactly something
you save for the scrapbook.

892
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:29,613
Cord blood is chock
full of stem cells.

893
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:32,421
Half of which will be his
perfect genetic match.
