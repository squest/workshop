NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:05,799
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:06,999
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:10,043
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:13,638
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,306
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,352
I just don't understand
why you never
bring your cell phone.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,184
A cell phone
won't change the fact
that you ran out of gas.

9
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,621
No, I didn't!

10
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,889
The gauge is broken.

11
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,088
Where are you going?

12
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,425
Maybe they have
a cell phone.

13
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:32,591
Wait, you don't
know who they are.

14
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,729
Nobody.
Now what?

15
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,363
Start walking.

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,232
(THUDDING)

17
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,571
What was that?

18
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,638
Somebody's in there.
Get it open.

19
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,075
FIag down a car.
Hurry!

(WHIMPERING)

21
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,687
Multiple stab wounds.

22
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,349
Looks Iike the guy clocked
her a couple of times

23
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,656
with a tire iron
before raping her
with it.

24
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,355
She's conscious,
though.

25
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:03,957
She tell you anything?

26
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,659
Can't. He superglued
her Iips shut.

27
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,167
She stopped
breathing, so
we had to crike her.

28
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,725
You got anything to
dissolve that with?

29
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:12,796
E.R.'s got a solvent
if she gets there.
No promises.

30
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,738
I'II go. Call you
if she says anything.

31
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,833
You got an ID?

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,607
(SIGHS) No purse, no keys.
Car's registered
to Meredith McGrath.

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,978
Seems Iike there's some
recent damage
to the bumper.

34
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,076
So he bumps into her,
she pulls over,
he attacks her.

35
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,121
Found these
in the trash.

36
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,384
Eighty bucks cash
in her wallet.

37
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,450
No driver's Iicense.
AII the credit cards
say Meredith McGrath.

38
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,392
Did you find
keys in there?
No.

39
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:37,363
So he took the keys.

40
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,294
He Ieaves the money,
he takes her Iicense.

41
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,695
With her home
address on it.

42
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,706
What's the address
on that registration?

43
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,368
What the hell happened?

44
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,909
Someone heard
a commotion.

45
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,002
By the time we get here,
he's already dead.

Sam Bishop.
This is Roger McGrath.

51
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,249
Looks Iike he
surprised a burglar.

52
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,848
But I'm pretty sure
the guy wasn't raped.

53
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,722
His wife was.

54
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,159
Tonight?

55
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,253
Couple hours ago.

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,729
We think the perp
stole her house keys,

57
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,459
came here Iooking
for something.

58
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,730
Hard drive of the computer.
Ripped it right out.

59
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,997
Was that the only
thing he touched?

60
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,369
Looks Iike.
But he missed this.

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,034
Found this in the desk,
with a couple of burned CDs.

62
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,667
I don't know,
might tell me
something.

63
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,440
So, how do you
want to work this?

64
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,012

When?

68
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,191
Okay. Thanks.

69
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:42,851
What?

70
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,024

Still there.
Caught a child
abuse case in the E.R.

73

But what's the story
on the husband's murder?

Witnesses only
heard a fight.

00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,387
We found prints
at the apartment.

76
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,451
They matched prints
on the wife's car.

77
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,463
I ran them through
the system. Zip.

Explains why
the husband was killed,

80
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,393
but why attack the wife
and superglue her mouth shut?

81
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,133
Sending a message.
Talked when she
shouldn't have.

82
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,640
Anything pop up
on the Iaptop?

Homicide detective
sent it over to TARU.

84
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,912
Said he'd give a buzz
if anything Iooked useful.

85
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,710
Yeah, meaning after his
case clears, we'II never
hear from him again.

86
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,613
So Iet's concentrate
on our own victim.

87
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,584
She was driving
home from work
when this happened.

88
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,052
Let's start there.

89
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,447
SCHWARTZ:
Everybody here
Ioved Meredith.

90
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,890
Anybody Iove her
in private?

91
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,291
What, Iike an affair? No.

92
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,454
At Ieast,
not with
anybody here.

93
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,587
How do you know?

94
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,894
Well, 80 percent
of the department
is female

95
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,059
and I don't think
her door
swung both ways.

96
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:32,162
The guys, not to be a jerk,
but I doubt she'd risk
her marriage on any of them.

97
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,002
Did she get
a promotion Iately,
a new office,

98
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,235
anything to make
one of her
co-workers jealous?

99
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,575
Not at all. In fact,
I almost had to fire her
a few months ago.

100
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:40,671
Why?

101
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,147
Well, some
performance issues.

102
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:45,947
Distracted, took a Iot
of sick days, vacation.

103
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,851
Then she was
back to normal.

104
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,218
What was going on
with her?

105
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,621
I'm not really sure.

106
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:54,354
She changed her e-mail
address seven or eight
times Iast year.

107
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,455
I think she had
some kind of stalker.

108
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,122
Do you mind
if we take a Iook
at her computer?

109
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,392
Oh, she didn't
have one here.

110
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,058
She always
brought her Iaptop.

111
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,803
Need the TARU report
on that Iaptop.

112
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,806
I don't have it yet.
Why?

113
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,398
Well, it belonged
to my victim.

114
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,204
You get anything
off those CD-ROMs?

115
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,040
Yeah, I got something.

116
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,674
STABLER: Kiddie porn.

117
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,808
BISHOP: Yeah.
Hundreds of pictures.

118
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,682
Probably what the perp
was Iooking for on
the hard drive.

119
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,280
And when were you going to get
around to sharing that piece
of information with me?

120
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,518
I've got to report to you
if my victim's a pervert?

121
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:29,460
No, you've got to tell me when
you find something pertaining
to my victim.

122
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,792
That CD belongs to her.

123
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,560
How do you know?
There's no
usable prints on it.

124
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,568
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

125
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,764
Meredith McGrath changed
her e-mail address
seven times Iast year.

126
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,741
I am betting she did it
because she didn't want
to get caught with that.

127
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,744
She was raped,
tortured and murdered.

128
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,643
This guy was after her,
not her husband.

129
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,342
Well, you SVU guys
want the perv crap,
you can have it.

130
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,288
MORALES: Real pleasant work,
detectives.
Thanks for sharing.

131
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,482
Find more kiddie porn?

132
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,286
More than 50 images.

133
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,293
From what I can tell,
they're of two
different girls.

134
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,056
One Iooks
eight or nine.

135
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,493
One 14 or 15.

136
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,203
Really twisted stuff.

137
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,966
This computer is jacked.
Some kind of virus.

138
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,337
I haven't been able
to view everything.

139
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,273
Any way to ID
these girls?

140
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,777
We send all child
pornography to the FBI.

141
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,677
MORALES: They use facial
recognition software.

142
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,909
Compare the porn
to the database at
the National Center

143
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,712
for Missing &
Exploited Children.

144
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,582
Any idea where Meredith
got these pictures?

145
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:30,453
Sent to her from
Nick2Shy@wiremail.bz.

146
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,719
She saves his e-mails
along with the photos.

147
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,818
And where can we
find this Nick?

148
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,196
Used a Wiremail account.
Anonymous server.

149
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,892
Yeah. Truth is,
nothing is really
anonymous.

150
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,491
Every e-mail you send,

151
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,265
every website you visit,
you transmit
an internet protocol address.

152
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,840
Most e-mails
have the IP number
in the header information.

153
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,206
Who is it?

154
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,472
AII I can tell you
is the server he used.

155
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,674
The IP is assigned
to the computer Iab
at Stuyvesant College.

156
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,343
Get a subpoena,
they can tell you
who the user is.

157
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,513
One more thing.
Mrs. McGrath also Iiked
to save her Internet chats.

158
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,885
Oh, yeah?
What did she
chat about?

159
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,787
Trolling for more porn.

160
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:08,157
I tried reading a couple
but then I stopped
when I felt Iike puking.

161
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,964
Wow. This your partner?

162
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,226
Yeah.

163
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,460
Does she date?

164
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,333
A Iot of guys.
So, there's just no way
to retrieve it, right?

165
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,434
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,103
College computer Iab?

167
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,410
There's no record of anyone
accessing the IP address.

168
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:32,077
Someone from a remote site
bypassed the Iog-in code.

169
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,012
They were hacked.

170
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,056
It's an old system.
There's no way
to trace this guy.

171
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,321
This Nick2Shy
is going through
an awful Iot of trouble

172
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,089
to keep his
identity a secret.

173
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,754
Well, come on,
if he killed her,

174
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,822
I mean, I think
he did us a favor.

175
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,264
I mean, Iisten to this one.

176
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,963
Here's a guy offering
Meredith 300 photos
of boys under seven.

177
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,836
In return,
he wants to take her son
to a motel for an hour.

178
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,272
Isn't that sweet?

179
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,438
She doesn't
have any kids.

180
00:07:58,212 --> 00:07:59,941
She told this
guy she did.

181
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,441
(SIGHS)

182
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,247
That is something
I am not understanding.

183
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,880
She seems to be doing
an awful Iot of Iying.

184
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,824
She goes into an adult
chat room, pretends she's
a 13-year-old girl.

185
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,987
She changes her screen name
to "Iuv2cheer13."

186
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,623
AImost immediately,
six guys are hitting on her.

187
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,825
So she's getting
off with a fantasy?

188
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,424
I don't know, but then
she starts setting up

189
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,129
meetings in hotels
with these guys.

190
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,898
Now, what the hell
is the point of that?

191
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,701
It's not Iike she
can all of a sudden

192
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,742
turn into this 13-year-old
girl once she gets there.

193
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,142
Okay. Why does she
flirt with them online?

194
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,014
Think about it.
She saves every one
of the communications

195
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,174
she has with these guys.

196
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,480
She doesn't offer
them anything illegal

197
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:39,985
until they ask for it.

198
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,146
Now, what does that
sound Iike to you?

199
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,348
A sicko.

200
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,721
It's also how the Feds
sting pedophiles online.

201
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,829
She's an informant.

202
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,259
Yeah, that makes sense.
How?

203
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,359
Well, that virus
I thought I found?
Actually a Trojan horse.

204
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,528
What's that?

205
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,801
It's a program hiding within
a seemingly innocuous file.

206
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,432
In this case,
it was designed to record

207
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,239
every single keystroke
Meredith McGrath made.

208
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,338
Each time she signed online,
it would transmit
the information in an e-mail.

209
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,677
To Nick2Shy.

210
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,809
Attached the Trojan to
a picture he sent her.

211
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,149
After that, he could read
every word she typed.

212
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,088
So he found out
she was an informant
and killed her,

213
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,284
stole the evidence
that she'd been
collecting against him.

214
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,690
So she's on
FBI payroll?

215
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,888
Possibly.
She sent huge
bundles of information

216
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,625
to a dot-gov address.
Federal domain.

217
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,394
Someone named
CIaudia Williams.

218
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,031
It's not FBI.

219
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,606
She's an assistant
U.S. attorney.

220
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,869
When were you going
to Iet us know that
she was working for you?

221
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,243
When I had something
to give you.

222
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,044
Well, when were you going
to tell me that you were using
a civilian to do your job?

223
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,108
Meredith McGrath was
going after pedophiles
on the Internet

224
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,813
Iong before
our involvement.

225
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,584
She considered herself
a cyber vigilante.

226
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,454
AII on her own? Why?

227
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,756
Maybe because she was
raped as a young girl

228
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,854
and decided to
get back at people
who exploit children.

229
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,627
She came to us, Detective.
What were we
supposed to do, ignore her?

230
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,191
So she did
your dirty work.

231
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,466
When she got killed for it,
"Oh well, it was her
decision." Is that it?

232
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:09,270
Meredith helped us
put away five pedophiles
in the Iast year.

233
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,167
Believe me when I tell you,

234
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,372
I want to find out
who killed her
just as badly as you do.

235
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,848
Okay. I want to see
the files on every perp
she went after,

236
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,613
and I don't want
to hear about it
compromising your cases.

237
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:22,886
Recognize her?

238
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,789
14-year-old
Mia Van Wagner
from Queens.

239
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,556
She's one of the girls
in the pictures on
Meredith's Iaptop.

240
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,723
How did you ID her?

241
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,131
FBI computer got the match.
She's been missing
for two weeks.

242
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:40,136
Mia's photographs didn't start
showing up on the Internet
until after her disappearance.

243
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,375
You're thinking she was
kidnapped and Meredith
found out about it?

244
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,934
It's possible.

245
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,912
Sounds Iike a motive
for murder to me.

246
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,189
What did the 117
have to say about
this missing girl?

247
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,588
They wrote it up
as a runaway.

248
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,651
She packed her bags,
stole a couple hundred
bucks from her mother.

249
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,423
There's no mention
of the porno pics.

250
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,623
Morning, Captain.

251
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,962
Bishop, you're getting
to be a regular
fixture around here.

252
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,592
Thinking about
a department transfer?

253
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,603
No, thanks.
I Iike my
victims dead.

254
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,434
Found the address
of the mother's work.

255
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:14,835
Restaurant
in Queens.

256
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,600
Thanks.

257
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,644
I had told the police
that I don't
think she ran away.

258
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,081
I know it Iooks
Iike that, but...

259
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,051
I think she must
have been forced
or something.

260
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,088
Mrs. Van Wagner,
does Mia spend
a Iot of time online?

261
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,282
No. My daughter
can't have the Internet.

262
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,451
I don't allow it. Why?

263
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,324
Pictures of her
showed up
in some e-mails.

264
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,091
We're just not quite
sure who sent them.

265
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,291
What kind of pictures?

266
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,799
Mrs. Van Wagner...

267
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,629
You have to show me.
Let me see them.

268
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,865
You don't need to
see the pictures.

269
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,105
If it were my daughter,
I wouldn't want
those images in my head.

270
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,342
Oh, my God.

271
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,013
Well, what's
happening to her?

272
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,744
That's what we're
trying to find out.

273
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,685
Is it possible
she uses
a friend's e-mail account?

274
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,188
I suppose.

275
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,990
She spends a Iot of time
at Samantha Gilligan's
house, but...

276
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,927
You know, the police
already talked to her.

277
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,394
Mia just took off.

278
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,958
She didn't tell me
where she was going,

279
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,298
and she hasn't
called me, okay?

280
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,632
Okay.

281
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,504
You know, you don't
seem too worried
about your friend.

282
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,703
Mia can take
care of herself.

283
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,180
She's way more
mature than people
think.

284
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,411
She ever come over here
and use your computer?

285
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,578
Probably.
I don't know.

286
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,915
BISHOP: You don't know?
Come on.

287
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,455
You guys went
online together,
right?

288
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,785
Hit the chat rooms,
maybe try to pick up guys.

289
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:38,950
Okay, whatever.

290
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,960
Did any guy ever
try to pick up Mia?

291
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,154
Am I psychic?

292
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,357
Wonder what your
friend's doing now?
Here, take a Iook at that.

293
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,956
Look Iike she's
having a Iot of fun?

294
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,898
Put it away.
Oh, my God.
That's Mia?

295
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,459
Put it away.
Somebody's doing
that to your friend.

296
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,664
So if you know where she is,
you've got to
tell us right now.

297
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,137
She had this
boyfriend, online.

298
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,268
Where are they?

299
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,210
I don't know, I swear.

300
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,446
She called me
a couple of days
after she Ieft,

301
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,781
but she didn't
tell me where she was.

302
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,847
There's no way
he would do
that stuff to her.

303
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,755
He Ioves her.

304
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,020
How do you
know that?

305
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,686
She showed me
his e-mails.

306
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,829
They were
really romantic.

307
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,163
Did you save
the e-mails he sent?

308
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,668
Go to the computer
and get them for me.

309
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,105
Why the hell did
you show her that?

310
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,336
She was Iying
her ass off.

311
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,345
So your solution is
terrorizing her into
giving you information?

312
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,813
Hey, we got what we
came for. I don't have
time to hold her hand.

313
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,144
Listen to me.

314
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,250
I don't want you
jumping in my
game Iike that again.

315
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,688
Are we clear?

316
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,859
Look, it's only going
to get uglier from
here on out,

317
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,988
so if you
can't handle it,

318
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,294
you've just got to
Iet me know right now.

319
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,860
Look, Iet's break
up the work.

320
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,700
I'II run down the phone
dump on this girl,

321
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,501
you run down the e-mails.

322
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,470
I don't recognize
the server name.

323
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,568
Let's see if the IP
tells us anything.

324
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,504
Whoa.

325
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,880
I think this is going
to be a Iittle out of
NYPD's jurisdiction.

326
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,043
Another state?

327
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,244
Another country.

328
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,878
Server's in Prague.

329
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,946
As in the Czech Republic.

330
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,126
U.S. Embassy in Prague
has confirmed the sender
is Erich Tassig,

331
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,189
a German national,
Iiving in the Czech Republic
for the Iast two years.

332
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,291
They pick him up?

333
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,768
The Czechs won't
arrest him based
on e-mails.

334
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,670
Which shows he was pursuing
a sexual relationship
with a minor.

335
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,708
He invited her
to Iive with him.
What else do they need?

336
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,333
Proof that he's
got the girl.

337
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,444
Erich Tassig has not
Ieft the Czech Republic
in eight months.

338
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,709
Yeah, well,
he must have convinced
her to go on her own.

339
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:47,810
U.S. Immigration says
Mia Van Wagner has never
been issued a passport.

340
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,450
AII right,
I don't know how
this dirtbag did it,

341
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,116
but he smuggled her
out of this country

342
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,525
and he's now
circulating pornographic
pictures of her.

343
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,960
Prove it.

344
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,520
The Czechs will
play ball with us.

345
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,589
We'II make sure of it.

346
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:05,031
Mia Van Wagner
had an e-mail
relationship with Tassig

347
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,470
for over one year.

348
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,339
Now, photos of Mia
and this unknown girl

349
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,402
were found on
Meredith McGrath's Iaptop.

350
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,847
AII of those photos
were sent to her
by Nick2Shy.

351
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,216
I'm thinking that this
is the guy who murdered
Meredith and her husband.

352
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,721
Could Tassig and Nick2Shy
be the same person?

353
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,622
I was thinking that,
but the e-mails
coming from Tassig

354
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:29,423
were clearly written by
somebody who doesn't speak
English as a first Ianguage.

355
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,088
Nick2Shy does.

356
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,691
So, Nick helps Tassig
get Mia out of the country.

357
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,099
Meredith finds out about it.

358
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,227
Nick kills her.

359
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,239
The question is,
how do these guys
know each other?

360
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,140
Okay. More importantly...

361
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,739
This girl is being
raped and tortured.

362
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,674
Where the hell is she?

363
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,045
Phone dump on
Samantha Gilligan.

364
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,883
Mia Van Wagner called
from a prepaid cell phone.

365
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,982
LUDs on that show she
used it the first two
days she was missing.

366
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,084
Nothing since.
Who else she call?

367
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,891
Three calls to
the same number.
Photocopy shop, Midtown.

368
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:05,797
You get passport photos
from those places.

369
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:12,333
WOMAN: Hi, can I help you?

370
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,601
We're Iooking for a girl
who came in for
a passport picture.

371
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,940
Oh, sure. That's Kerry.
What, is she in trouble?

372
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:19,377
How do you know Kerry?

373
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,905
I met her a couple weeks ago.
Ron brought her in.
She's his daughter.

374
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:24,144
Ron who?

375
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,413
Ron Crowley.
He's my boss.

376
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,512
He's right in the back
if you want to talk to him.

377
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:33,587
Ronnie?

378
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,595
I'm sorry,
this area's restricted
to employees only.

379
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:38,029
No, it's not.
We heard you brought

380
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:39,999
your daughter to
work a couple weeks ago.

381
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,398
So?

382
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:43,437
BISHOP: Is that her?
No.

383
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,233
Strong resemblance,
but no, that's not Kerry.

384
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,603
Take a better Iook.

385
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,733
CIerk out front said
that is definitely
your daughter.

386
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,243
Well, I guess I'd know
my own kid better
than she would.

387
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:52,370
BISHOP: How many
daughters you got,
Ronnie?

388
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,606
One. Is that all?

389
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:57,549
Got any pictures of her?
I got tons of pictures
of my kids with me.

390
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,746
Come on.
I'II show you mine
if you show me yours.

391
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,016
What are you doing?

392
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,455
Let me see
your wallet, Ron.

393
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,856
You can't do that.

394
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:07,223
Is this your daughter?

395
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,063
She Iooks nothing Iike
the girl you brought in,
Ron.

396
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:12,560
Let's go.

397
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,929
I never saw
that girl
in my Iife.

398
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,368
So your employee
was Iying.

399
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:18,769
She made a mistake.

400
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,976
How come Mia Van Wagner
called your store
three times?

401
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:24,773
How do I know?
Maybe she
needed copies.

402
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:26,176
Wrong answer.

403
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:27,441
What the hell
is your problem?

404
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:30,450
Detective Bishop
here is very impatient.

405
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:32,042
Now, you're going
to do yourself
a big favor

406
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,110
if you just answer
our questions
honestly.

407
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:35,382
I am.

408
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,720
Good. Tell me about
Meredith McGrath.

409
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,422
Never heard of her.

410
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,892
The woman you
raped and murdered.

411
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:43,995
Wait a minute.
You got the wrong guy!

412
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,657
She found out
about you, Ronnie,

413
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,360
what a sick Iittle
worm you are.
So you killed her!

414
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:48,595
I did not!

415
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:50,227
Take a walk, Detective.

416
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:51,662
It's all right.

417
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,899
CRAGEN: Let's go, Bishop.

418
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:59,471
I'm CIaudia Williams,
Assistant U.S. Attorney.

419
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:00,809
Are you all right,
Mr. Crowley?

420
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,907
I'II be better when I smack
a Iawsuit on that guy's ass.
Did you see that?

421
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:06,976
Well, you won't be
dealing with Detective
Bishop anymore.

422
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,820
Mr. Crowley,
do you still have custody
of your daughter, Kerry?

423
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,027
No, my ex-wife's got her.

424
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:16,563
Did you recently obtain
a U.S. passport for her?

425
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,056
No.

426
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,636
I have an application
you made to Immigration
with your signature

427
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:26,172
and I have an official copy
of your daughter's
birth certificate

428
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,538
that you gave them
along with this photograph.

429
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,511
This is not your daughter.
This is Mia Van Wagner.

430
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,448
Fraudulently obtaining
a U.S. passport is a serious
offense, Mr. Crowley.

431
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,178
And if you think
the NYPD was tough on you,

432
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:41,779
just wait until you start
dealing with the Federal
government.

433
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,287
I didn't kidnap her.

434
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:46,889
AII I did was get
her the passport

435
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:49,691
and help her
Ieave the country,
which she wanted to do.

436
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,560
Who's in Prague?

437
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,690
I don't know his name.

438
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,701
You trade
kiddie porn with him.
Don't bother to deny it.

439
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:57,862
Customs is already
searching your house.

440
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,204
He gave me five
grand to help her.

441
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,676
He bought her
the plane ticket,

442
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:07,145
but I'm telling you,
that girl went willingly.

443
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,443
Who's this girl?

444
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:11,746
I've never seen her.

445
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,219
Her picture is on
Meredith McGrath's computer.

446
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:17,223
I never heard of that woman.
Look, I didn't kill anybody,

447
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,452
and I didn't force
anybody to do anything.

448
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:20,824
I was helping.

449
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,020
Is that a crime?

450
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,793
Crowley's wrong
for the murder.

451
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,299
His prints don't
match either scene.

452
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,199
I'm more worried
about finding
Mia Van Wagner.

453
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,828
Detective Stabler,

454
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:33,499
how is it that you've
never been issued
a passport?

455
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,074
Never needed one. Why?

456
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:37,201
Well, you do now.

457
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:40,509
Customs wants an SVU
detective in Prague
when they find the girl.

458

You can pick up your

at Kennedy in two hours,

is amenable to
Ioaning you out.

460
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,750

better pack, Detective.

(BELLS TOLLING)

462
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:05,167
Detective Stabler?

463
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,038
Yeah.
Kate Logan.

464
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:09,302
I'm the Europol officer
assigned to this
investigation.

465
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,468
Nice to meet you.

466
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:14,002
U.S. Customs will furnish
you with a sidearm for
the duration of your stay.

467
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:15,571
Do you speak
Czech or German?

468
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:17,116
A Iittle Spanish. Sorry.

469
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,742
Then you'II
stick with me.

470
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:21,585
NYPD doesn't often
dispatch their detectives

471
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,555
to foreign countries
to arrest a suspect.

472
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:26,218
Well, they do
when the guy is
a particular dirtbag.

473
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,853
Well, you'II find
there's no shortage
of those here.

474
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,863
Welcome to
the Czech Republic.

475
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:34,299
Why is Europol so
interested in Tassig?

476
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:36,700
Czech Republic is not even
an E.U. member yet.

477
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,206
Both Europol and Interpol
have independently
suspected Erich Tassig

478
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:44,301
of trafficking young girls
from Eastern Europe
to Germany and Austria.

479
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,107
Two years ago,
he fled to
the Czech Republic

480
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,080
and he's been off
our radar ever since,

481
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:51,242
reinventing himself
as this
Internet entrepreneur.

482
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,876
Producing and distributing
child pornography.

483
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,477
Likely,
but we can't prove it.

484
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,648
AII his work
appears to be
Iegitimate.

485
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,521
My specific interest?

486
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,561
We almost had the bastard
and he slipped
through our fingers.

487
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:03,494
It won't
happen again.

488
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:10,263
Detective,
glad to have you aboard.

489
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,828
Mike Pearson, U.S.
Customs attaché.

490
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,469
I'd Iike to give
you a chance to sleep

491
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,306
but we've had
some developments
since you Ieft New York.

492
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:19,710
That's okay.
I came here to work.

493
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,270
LOGAN: What developments?

494
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:25,114
Last night, the Czech police
jumped the gun
and raided Tassig's flat.

495
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,884
He and the girl
are in the wind.

496
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,218
How did he know
that we were
onto them?

497
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,316
Customs in D.C.
traced an e-mail
from Tassig's ISP

498
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:35,260
to a Samantha Gilligan
in New York.

499
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,887
Samantha replied
the next day.

500
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,489
That's Mia Van Wagner's
friend. She must
have warned her.

501
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:43,093
Well, we've released this
picture of Miss Van Wagner
to the media.

502
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:47,405
Tip Iine goes to the Czech
police, they'II contact us
with anything Iegit.

503
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,339
How hard would it be
for them to Ieave
the country?

504
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,900
Tassig won't try it.

505
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,605
He's got too
much reason to stay.

506
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,477
Why? He's already
got the girl.

507
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:59,042
I think you need a Iesson
on the child sex trade in
the Czech Republic, Detective.

508
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:04,849
LOGAN: In some of these
Czech border towns,

509
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:07,086
the brothels outnumber
the churches.

510
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,060
So every week,
about 10,000
Germans come here

511
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,257
because the prostitutes
are half-price,

512
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,858
because anything
you want, you can get.

513
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,960
See those pink
curtains there?
Mmm-hmm.

514
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:20,302
They indicate that if
you were so inclined
and had 500 crowns,

515
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:23,309
they'd give you a child
under the age of
10 for 30 minutes.

516
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:25,345
That's $17 U.S.

517
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:28,014
BIue curtains
mean you'd get a boy.

518
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:29,811
Where do they get
these children?

519
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:33,011
Some are orphans,
smuggled in from
Romania and Bulgaria.

520
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:36,386
Eric Tassig isn't
the only man profiting
off the sale of children.

521
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:38,152
You don't do
anything about it,
huh?

522
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,785
Europol has no authority
over the Czech citizens.

523
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:44,024
As far as the Czech police,
they have no
incentive to stop it.

524
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,292
There's too much
money to be made

Look, this is the world
that we Iive in,
Detective Stabler.

527
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,500
I should think in
your Iine of work,
you'd understand that.

528
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:58,011
In my Iine of work,
we wouldn't just
sit back and take it.

529
00:22:58,078 --> 00:22:59,511
That's very noble.

530

the demand for child
exploitation exists,

531

there's Iittle
we can do.

You Iet him run.

575
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:54,382
I had two choices,
get him or save the girl.

I thought Mia
was more important.

You just took away
Tassig's one reason

He could be
anywhere now.

So your solution is
I should have just
Iet her run away again?

580
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:03,956
We would have had him
in custody and we'd have

Eventually?

We'II talk to Mia,
she'II Iead us to Tassig.

to help us?

Ietting me Ieave?

Because you're 14 years old
and we have to protect you.

594
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:44,904
I don't need you
to protect me.

Yes.

Ieave you behind?

Ioves you?

to so many other girls.

I'm not going to
talk about it anymore.

00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:12,993
He sells girls for sex.

is not who
you think he is.

Erich Tassig is a criminal,
he's a Iiar,

Oh, my God.

But you could get
them back, right?

00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:44,407
Police! Drop everything!
Let me see your hands!

763
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,707
This is private property.

764
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,340
No, this is destroying
the evidence that you pay
people to molest children.

765
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:52,614
We only sell passwords.
We don't know what people
put on their website.

766
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:53,745
What are you
telling me, Iady?

767
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:55,655
That you don't know
what the website
child-dot-rape's all about?

768
00:35:56,926 --> 00:35:58,291
Shut up.

769
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:01,388
STABLER: What's the story?

770
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:04,262
Unbelievable.
This is even bigger
than the Feds thought.

771
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:07,268
Company grossed 15 mil
in the past
fiscal year alone.

772
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:09,827
For selling a $30 password?
How many subscribers they got?

773
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:14,434
Last count, 300,000 accessing
more than a hundred child porn
sites in 20 countries.

774
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,375
What else
have you got
on the subscribers?

775
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:18,436
Everything. They keep
immaculate records.

776
00:36:18,514 --> 00:36:20,505
Bank accounts,
checking accounts,

777
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:23,143
credit cards,
e-mail address,
home address.

778
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,016
AIready found 60
in Manhattan,
Detective.

779
00:36:25,087 --> 00:36:26,111
You guys
are going
to be busy.

780
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:29,124
How hard would it be to
Iook up one of these guy's
e-mail addresses?

781
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:30,352
Just a simple word search.

782
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:32,519
Nick2Shy, Wiremail account.

783
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:38,131
Name's Nicholas Taylor.
No address Iisted.

784
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:41,467
However, I've got
a MasterCard
and Visa account.

785
00:36:41,537 --> 00:36:43,562
Bills got to go somewhere.

786
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,930
Print that out.

787
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:18,405
Are you Amy?

788
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:24,811
Hi, I'm EIIiot.
I'm a policeman.
Is your dad home?

789
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:28,347
He's upstairs, sleeping.

790
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:34,452
Where's your
policeman clothes?

791
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:40,359
Well, I'II tell you what,

792
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:42,624
will my policeman's badge do?

793
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:46,692
Why don't you take it
while I talk to your dad?

794
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,062
PIease, sweetheart.

795
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:50,969
You can hang out here
with my good friend, Sam.

796
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,405
He's a cop, too.

797
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:55,201
What do you say?

798
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:57,969
Will you do
that for me?

799
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:16,224
Can I get a
glass of water?

800
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:18,733
Which way's
the kitchen?
Go ahead.

801
00:38:56,872 --> 00:38:58,567
(GUN FIRING)

802
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:01,041
You're under arrest.
Get dressed.

803
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,737
Where's my daughter?
Where's Amy?

804
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:04,370
Where's your daughter?

805
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,278
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

806
00:39:07,817 --> 00:39:09,614
Like you give a damn.

807
00:39:13,756 --> 00:39:15,451
Now, get dressed.

808
00:39:19,862 --> 00:39:23,559
Your prints were
at the scene of
Meredith McGrath's murder.

809
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:25,827
And your prints were
at the scene of
Roger McGrath's murder.

810
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:28,995
Okay. Let's get
Cabot down here.

811
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,265
We're ready to deal.

812
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:35,242
You think you can get a deal
out of her on two murders
and prolonged child abuse?

813
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:38,245
Good Iuck.

814
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:40,942
It's not going to make
a difference once
the Feds get you, anyway.

815
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:43,280
I don't abuse my daughter.
STABLER: Yeah, you do.

816
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:44,580
Since before she
was able to walk.

817
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:45,813
TAYLOR: So you say.

818
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:47,515
So your website
says, genius.

819
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,581
That's why you killed
the McGraths, isn't it?

820
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:53,191
She knew what you
were doing. You had
to protect your secret.

821
00:39:53,262 --> 00:39:54,729
She misrepresented herself.

822
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:57,322
Yeah. Pretending to be
as disgusting as you.

823
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,526
She betrayed me.

824
00:39:58,601 --> 00:39:59,727
You betrayed
your daughter.

825
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:01,429
I did not.

826
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:05,133
I Iove Amy more than
you'II ever realize.

827
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:07,872
And I'm not going to feel
bad just because you're
telling me I should.

828
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:09,535
That's enough.

829
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:11,273
This interview is over.
Detectives...

830
00:40:11,347 --> 00:40:12,871
TAYLOR: Society
says I'm wrong.

831
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:17,885
But not Iong ago,
society said interracial
marriage was wrong, too.

832
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:21,650
Not Iong ago,
society executed
homosexuals.

833
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:24,215
Did you hear that?
Now, that is a classic.

834
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:28,161
It's the pedophile's
justification for why he's
not the pervert we know he is.

835
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,926
I used to think
I was alone. I'm not.

836
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,060
There are hundreds
of thousands of people
just Iike me.

837
00:40:34,136 --> 00:40:35,262
Maybe millions.

838
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:36,861
You mean your
buddies on
the Internet?

839
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:39,165
You're right.

840
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,573
And you freaks
will never be alone
in prison.

841
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:44,272
Ever think that maybe
you're the minority?

842
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:47,076
Ever think that
maybe you're the freaks?

843
00:40:47,149 --> 00:40:51,085
Go ahead,
arrest us,
persecute us.

844
00:40:52,054 --> 00:40:53,817
We're not going away.

845
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:57,549
We're not going to
play by your rules

846
00:40:57,626 --> 00:41:00,493
and nothing you can do

847
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:02,428
will ever change that.

848
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:14,440
Another round.
I'm buying.

849
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,772
No, I've got
to get home.

850
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:18,871
I've got to make
sure my kids remember
what I Iook Iike.

851
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:20,279
Yeah? How many you got?

852
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,407
Four.

853
00:41:21,484 --> 00:41:22,508
(WHISTLES)

854
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:24,576
They why you do
this job?

855
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:29,285
They're part of it.

856
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,324
I guess I can see
what you get out of it.

857
00:41:31,393 --> 00:41:34,954
AII those guys you put away,
who knows how many more kids
they would've hurt.

858
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,893
Tough gig, though, huh?
Really got to Iove it.

859
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:47,466
No. You've got
to hate it.

860
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:51,476
It's the only way
you'II be any
good at it.
