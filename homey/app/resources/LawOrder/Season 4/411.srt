00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:00,063
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:04,867
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,170
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

4
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,176
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:12,645
are members of an elite squad
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,409
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:18,343
We should get
Out Of Africa.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,650
Sarah,
this isn't gonna work.

9
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:22,917
Okay, fine. Die Hard.

10
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:25,152
No, I can't
do this anymore.

11
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:27,354
What, rent a movie?

12
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:28,987
You and me.

13
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:31,862
I told you I didn't want
a serious relationship.

14
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,697
You knew this
from the start.

15
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:39,935
You are such
an incredible bastard.

16
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,533
Hey, don't pretend
Iike I didn't tell you
this a month ago.

17
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:43,600
(GUN FIRING)

18
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,843
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
He's shot! Help!

19
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,475
John.
WOMAN: Somebody,
call the cops!

20
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:51,917
Somebody, help!

21
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:53,852
I got him! I got him!

22
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:55,514
Oh, my God!
Somebody, please!

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,525
My sister!
Somebody, do something!

24
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,618
Call somebody!

25
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,857
Somebody! Why isn't anyone
doing anything?

26
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:09,834
Dave Duethorn,
boy detective.

27
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:11,770
Guess they'II give
that gold shield
to anyone.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,308
Yeah.
They gave one to you.
At Ieast I earned it.

29
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:16,776
Don't flatter yourself.
We got a double?
Could be a triple.

30
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:18,779
Bus took the six-year-old,
Rebecca Kurtz,
to the hospital.

31
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:20,644
Doesn't Iook good.
She get hit out here?

32
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,910
Inside the store,
with her older sister Missy.

33
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,918
Pretty shaken up.
E.R.'s gonna
check her out.

34
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,920
Is this our shooter?
Bystander.

35
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:29,889
John Marcum. Walking in,
took one in the chest.

36
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,653
Poor bastard.

37
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:33,387
Should've stayed
home and watched TV.

38
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:36,488
That's the stick up kid.
Name's Eric Campbell.

39
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:39,762
Three witnesses saw him
come in wearing a ski mask,
gun in hand.

40
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:42,065
Tells everybody to get down,
"Show me the money."

41
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:46,130
So he's standing
over at the register.

42
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:50,977
The victims are
both over there.

43
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,738
Something spooked him.

44
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:55,112
Witness says someone
dropped a tape.

45
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,411
Probably the Iittle girl.

46
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,248
He fires, hits the kid
and the guy outside.

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,685
AII right,
who shot him?

48
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:02,245
CIerk. A kid named
Joey Field.

49
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,722
AII right.
Well, where is our hero?

50
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:06,727
On the bus,
being treated for shock.

51
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:13,456
Name's Dave Duethorn.
I'm a detective.
How're you feeling?

52
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:16,265
I guess I'm okay.
Compared to him.

53
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:19,569
I can't believe
I killed someone.

54
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,802
Well, think of it
as customer service.

55
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:23,539
Where'd you get
the piece?

56
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:24,840
The owner.

57
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,313
He keeps a Ioaded gun
under the counter.

58
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:30,840
I just...
I guess I wasn't
thinking.

59
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,045
AII right, all right,
take it easy.

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,610
I wasn't...
It's okay, it's okay,
all right.

61
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:36,384
It's a good thing you got him
before he could shoot anyone
else. Understand?

62
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,823
Yeah.
AII right.

63
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:39,654
Fascitelli,
take the kid home.

64
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,162
I got him.
Come on, Iet's go.

65
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,891
That was the hospital.

66
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:45,830
Little girl's
on Iife support.

67
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,365
Are you ready for this?

68
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,425
Gonorrhea?

69
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,072
Found it when they
checked her out. They're doing
a rape kit now.

70
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,732
Any chance
she'II survive?

71
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,366
Bullet sliced
an artery in her chest.

72
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:58,071
Medics resuscitated her
en route, but her brain's
toast.

73
00:02:58,146 --> 00:02:59,977
No oxygen
for 10 minutes.

74
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,345
Where are the parents?
Waiting room.

75
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,678
They know about
the gonorrhea?

76
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:04,946
Figured I'd Ieave
that to the sex police.

77
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,335
We were renting a video.

78
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,636
Becca was so scared.

79
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,507
I kept trying to
make her be quiet.

80
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,342
We were just
renting a video.

81
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:09,609
Calm down, calm down.
Take a couple
of deep breaths.

82
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:12,050
It's all right.
Take it easy, take it easy.

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,884
They told me that
I can't see my sister,

84
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,321
and they won't
tell me anything.

85
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:18,586
I mean, is she dead?
No.

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,491
I don't believe you.
I want to just...

87
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:22,189
I need to be
told the truth.

88
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:24,391
Rebecca's on
Iife support.

89
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:28,836
Are my
parents here?

90
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:30,302
I really need
to be with them.

91
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,361
They're with your sister.

92
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,465
You think you can handle
a couple of questions before
we take you upstairs?

93
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,736
Yeah.

94
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:37,102
Any other siblings?

95
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,338
No.

96
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,745
You and Rebecca
got along really well?

97
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:44,945
My parents made me baby-sit
her after school,
but I didn't want to.

98
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,488
I just wanted to hang out
with my friends.

99
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:52,583
I just wish I hadn't been
such a brat about it.
Becca didn't...

100
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,356
She didn't want a movie.

101
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:56,090
I made her come with me.

102
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,997
Your parents both
at work today?

103
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,933
Mom's an accountant.
Dad does this...

104
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:02,731
Some stockbroker
thing at home.

105
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,567
Dad ever take
care of Rebecca?

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,937
Usually. But today
he had an appointment.

107
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,769
Your dad and Rebecca
spend a Iot of time together?

108
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:15,339
After school,
he takes her to the park,
to the zoo.

109
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,510
You know, places Iike that.

110
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,281
She's daddy's Iittle girl.

111
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:22,220
MUNCH: Like you were
when you were her age?

112
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,315
I wish.

113
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,188
I was more Iike daddy's
Iittle punching bag.

114
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:30,830
Nobody did anything?

115
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,867
Social workers came,
took me away.

116
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:35,934
The Kurtzs adopted
me when I was 12.

117
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:40,536
They're never gonna
forgive me for this.

118
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:47,236
Hey.

119
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,241
I just spoke with Munch.

120
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:53,515
It seems that Daddy
and Rebecca had
a very close relationship.

121
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:55,881
They collect
the swabs yet?

122
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:58,158
Doctor did a preliminary
genital exam.

123
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:01,127
He's gotta do a colposcopy
to confirm the rape.

124
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:02,220
STABLER: Thank you.

125
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,663
Excuse me.
Where are you going
with my daughter's clothes?

126
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,963
I'm Detective Stabler.
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.

127
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,696
We need them
for evidence.

128
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,261
What evidence?
I thought the bastard
who shot her was dead.

129
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,601
STABLER: He is.

130
00:06:12,674 --> 00:06:13,868
Well, I don't understand.

131
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,876
Well, honey,
Iet the police
do their jobs.

132
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:17,912
Could we have a moment
with each of you?

133
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,879
I can't Ieave her.

134
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,473
Can't this wait?

135
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,745
Why don't we step outside?
It'II just take a moment.

136
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,379
If anything changes,
I'II come and get you.

137
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,750
(MONITOR BEEPING)

138
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:36,655
The doctors say that
Rebecca's brain dead.

139
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,256
That she'II
never wake up.

140
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,063
I'm very sorry.

141
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,035
We'd given up trying
to get pregnant,
so we adopted Missy.

142
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:48,200
And Rebecca
was our miracle.

143
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:50,667
Your husband must
have been thrilled.

144
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:54,772
We all were.
Missy had
a Iittle sister.

145
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:55,975
Peter just...

146
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,213
He stayed home,
working so he could...

147
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:01,084
Oh, he couldn't get
enough of them.

148
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:07,953
Why would God
bless us Iike that
and just take her away?

149
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,398
Look, did something
happen to Missy?

150
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,097
Because the other detective
said she was all right.

151
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:19,902
No, no, she's fine.
They're actually going
to bring her by soon.

152
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:23,307
PIease wait. I gotta figure
out how to explain to her
that this wasn't her fault.

153
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:24,902
She's been
through enough.

154
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,412
Well, then I will
get her a ride home.

155
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,880
Is there somebody there?

156
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,817
Yeah, my family's
coming in from upstate.
She won't be alone.

157
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:35,378
Look, Detective,
what aren't you telling me?

158
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,583
There's no easy way
to say this.

159
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:43,096
Rebecca's been
sexually abused.

160
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,131
(SOFTLY) What?

161
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:47,600
We're still investigating,

162
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:51,602
but the doctor said
that she'd tested
positive for gonorrhea.

163
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,708
Oh, God.

164
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:59,980
How could this
be happening?

165
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:05,844
In these kinds of cases,
it's typically
somebody who knew the victim.

166
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,948
Well, then it must
have been at school.

167
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,288
I mean, she's there
most of the day.

168
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:16,052
I understand that you're
her primary caregiver?

169
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,597
Yeah, I...

170
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,795
You're accusing me
of hurting Rebecca?

171
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:22,200
Sir, we're not
accusing anyone.

172
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,067
Yes, you are.
You think I raped
my daughter.

173
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:25,435
Mr. Kurtz.

174
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:28,203
It's my job
to rule everyone out.

175
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:33,170
Now, you'd really help us out
if you'd consent
to a gonorrhea test.

176
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:37,041
You go to hell.

177
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,153
Rebecca's social
calendar was packed.

178
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:47,160
She had ballet twice a week.
She took piano Iessons
at home.

179
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:49,162
Taught by a 75-year-old
grandmother.

180
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,357
We checked her and
the ballet teachers.
AII clean.

181
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:52,626
And the school?

182
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,962
That's where we're
off to right now.

183
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:55,332
Dad agree to
the gonorrhea test?

184
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:56,631
He told me
to shove it.

185
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,138
But under the circumstances,
I might've said
the same thing.

186
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:01,334
Your gut says
he's clean?
Yeah.

187
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,502
He came across as
a devoted family man.

188
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:05,443
Quit his job so
he could stay home
with the kids.

189
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:06,844
I wish I could do that.

190
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:09,577
Yeah, but unlike pops,
you got no priors.

191
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:11,346
BENSON: What for?
Sexual abuse.

192
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:14,183
Missy filed a complaint
against Peter Kurtz
5 years ago.

193
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,314
Well, Iet's find out why.

194
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,228
Missy told her teacher
that Peter Kurtz abused her,

195
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,285
and we Iooked into it.

196
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:23,387
What'd you find?

197
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:26,194
That she was mistaking
normal affection
for sexual advances.

198
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:27,359
Define normal.

199
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:28,459
Oh, a kiss on the cheek,
a hug.

200
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:30,128
That's as hot and
heavy as it got.

201
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:33,002
So she doesn't know
the difference between
a good touch and a bad touch.

202
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:36,009
Not surprising,
considering the hell
the girl came from.

203
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,739
Missy told us that her
biological father beat her.

204
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:39,837
And raped her.

205
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:40,938
And if that
wasn't bad enough,

206
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:43,506
crack bastard pimped
her out to his friends.

207
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:46,349
I hope you spread
the short eyes Iabel
through the prison yard.

208
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,651
Didn't have to.
He died Iast year of AIDS.

209
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,884
Fortunately,
Missy tested negative.

210
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,395
So Missy's complaint
against Peter Kurtz
just went away, huh?

211
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:56,692
They don't just
go away, Detective.

212
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,494
We got her some counseling,
and she recanted.

dig on the Kurtzs?

checked them out.

surprise visits.

217
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:09,173
They jumped through
hoops to adopt her.

218

Aside from her

00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,784
did Rebecca have contact
with any other adults here?

Art, music,

226
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,760
Mr. Curtis,
the reason
that we're here

227
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:35,394
is because Rebecca
has gonorrhea.

My God.

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,103
You don't think that
one of my people...

We would Iike to test

to prove our case?

been performed yet?

to determine whether
or not she was raped.

Rebecca's condition,
after 24 hours,

282
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:53,238
microvascular collapse
begins to occur,

283
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,538
causing blood clots
which irreparably
damage the organs.

don't wish to exacerbate
the Kurtzs tragedy, but...

Then, don't.
If that Iittle boy in Philly
doesn't get Rebecca's Iiver,

he won't Iast another day.

287
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,651
And this additional
evidence is so critical

288
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:11,783
that the People are
willing to jeopardize
the Iife of another child?

from happening again.

Mr. Kurtz, my heart goes out
to you and your family.

But it is my duty to see
that justice is done
on behalf of your daughter.

293

And since we can't
un-pull the plug,

294
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:37,778
I'm afraid I have no other
choice but to grant
the restraining order.

295
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,708
I'm sorry.

is inflict any more

I didn't sleep all night.
I kept checking in on my kids.

309
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:49,912
Well, you should
have called me.

310
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,424
I didn't sleep, either.

311
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,323
Anybody page you?

312
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:54,986
No. Why? What's up?

313
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,723
Rebecca Kurtz
died this morning.

314
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:00,861
They do the transplant?

315
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,732
Kid in Philly is in
surgery right now.

316
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,828
AIex woke up a judge
to Iift the T.R.O.

317
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:06,669
as soon as they
finished the colposcopy.

318
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,232
And?
And she was
raped repeatedly.

319
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,240
What about the gonorrhea?

320
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:13,837
Family's clean.

321
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:16,475
Well, it's a good thing
we put them through hell,
then.

322
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,680
Well, much as I hate
to say this, dad could
have been treated.

323
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:24,555
Test comes up negative
if the doctor's
given you antibiotics.

324
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,027
You should know better than
to ask me any
questions about a patient.

325
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,691
And you should know
that you have to answer them

326
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:37,260
if you have any information
about Peter Kurtz abusing
his daughter.

327
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:38,498
What are you
talking about?

328
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:40,301
Rebecca Kurtz
had gonorrhea.

329
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:43,637
My God.
I didn't know.

330
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:46,703
The school said
that you saw her
for wetting the bed.

331
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:50,342
You don't usually test
for STDs on a six-year-old.

332
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:51,680
She didn't complain
of any symptoms.

333
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:54,084
Failure to report child abuse
is a crime, Doctor.

334
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,615
It wasn't her father.
Peter didn't do it.

335
00:15:57,693 --> 00:15:58,921
STABLER: How do you know that?

336
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:01,656
I just did
Peter's physical.
His urine was clean.

337
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,197
Why'd you test it?

338
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:06,393
Because I wanted to make sure
Peter hadn't abused Missy.

339
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,863
Missy has gonorrhea?

340
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:11,496
I treated her two weeks ago.

341
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:15,835
Missy, we need to
talk to your parents.

342
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:18,243
Do you know who
raped my sister?

343
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:19,678
We think you do.

344
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,217
We know you
had gonorrhea.

345
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,011
We're trying to plan
a funeral here.

346
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:27,612
Don't you people
have any decency?

347
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:30,522
It's not their fault,
Daddy. It's mine.

348
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,617
No one could ever blame you
for what happened.

349
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:35,891
He raped me and he raped
Rebecca, and I couldn't
stop him!

350
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:38,626
Missy, what are you saying?

351
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:42,430
He just...
He told me he would kill me
if I ever told anyone.

352
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,096
Who? Who, honey?
Who was it?

353
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,974
Missy, there's nothing
he can do to hurt you anymore.

354
00:16:53,415 --> 00:16:56,179
It was Joe, my boyfriend.

355
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,411
Missy, why didn't you tell me?

356
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,420
I was afraid.

357
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:01,115
Where can we find him?

358
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:06,688
He Iives with his parents
on Park, and he works
at Movie Madness.

359
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:09,162
The clerk from the store
where Rebecca was shot?

360
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:11,699
MISSY: He made me
bring her there.

361
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,756
Why?

362
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,702
Becca had said that
she was gonna tell
what he did to her.

363
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:18,364
I told Joey,
I said to him,

364
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,876
I said that there was no way
that he could ever
go anywhere near her.

365
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:26,676
But he said that he
would kill both of us
if we didn't show up.

366
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,416
It was a set up?

367
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:35,684
Missy says that Joey Field
and Eric Campbell
were friends.

368
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,954
She didn't know that Campbell
was the shooter until they
pulled off his ski mask.

369
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,654
Joey orchestrates
Rebecca's murder,

370
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,629
he burns his friend
so he can't talk,

371
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:43,959
makes himself
Iook Iike the hero.

372
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:47,593
But even with Missy's
testimony, all we can
get Joey on is rape.

373
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:49,068
BENSON: He murdered
three people.

374
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:51,435
And to prove it,
we need physical evidence.

375
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:52,632
Joey Field has no priors,

376
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:54,971
and you can bet
he's gonna have
top dollar representation.

377
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:56,101
Why?

378
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:59,079
His father is Malcolm Field.
Of Prescott, Field and Browne.

379
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:02,844
Deep pockets and a Iot
of friends in high places,
including the new D.A.

380
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:06,454
Here's Eric Campbell's sheet.
Two theft, three assaults.

381
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:07,715
It's not a big Ieap
to murder.

382
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,381
But still, it takes
a special kind of scrote

383
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,755
to be shooting
an innocent kid.

384
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:13,056
Yeah. The kind who
does it for money.

385
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:15,961
Which Joey could've got
from his rich Iawyer daddy.

386
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:17,794
What does your boss
want to do with this?

387
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,265
My Iieutenant says
it's your call.

388
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,859
AII right.
Well, we started this mess,
we'II take it from here.

389
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,199
Missy'd have
kept her mouth shut,

390
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:24,499
it would've been
the perfect crime.

391
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:26,302
You don't know there's
a trampoline in the room,

392
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:28,069
you're not going to dust
the ceiling for prints.

393
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:30,202
Well, the crime Iab thought
it was a robbery gone bad,

394
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:32,473
just Iike the rest of us.
We tell them what happened,

395
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:33,707
maybe they'II
help us prove it.

396
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:35,010
AII right, call them.

397
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,744
You make the notification
on Eric Campbell?

398
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:40,219
Yeah, to his father.
He Iives in a bottle
over in AIphabet City.

399
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:42,119
Take Munch.
Pay him a visit.

400
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,987
They're in for
a real treat.

401
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,550
What do you think you're
gonna find that the other
cops couldn't?

402
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:48,425
So you don't mind us
taking a Iook around then?

403
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:49,486
Whatever.

404
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:51,156
Eric talk about
his friends?

405
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:52,825
I don't think
he had any.

406
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:54,869
Loser Iike him,
he's better off dead.

407
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,836
Yeah, well,
you set a fine example.

408
00:18:56,905 --> 00:19:00,841
Yeah, well, I didn't teach him
to rob stores and shoot
Iittle girls.

409
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:04,310
No robbery.
That Iittle girl's
shooting was a hit.

410
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:05,937
He killed that
kid on purpose?

411
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,276
You seem surprised.

412
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:10,110
He was more of a Ioser
than I thought.

413
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,380
Looks Iike a stereo
showroom in there.

414
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:14,820
Your Ioser son been flashing
around money Iately?

415
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,290
He didn't flash it,
but he sure knew
how to spend it.

416
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,986
Mind if we take a Iook?

417
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,652
Knock yourself out.

418
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:27,191
This must've fell off
the back of some truck.

419
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:32,434
Actually, paid cash
for it Iast week.

420
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:37,308
TV, DVD player,
answering machine.

421
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:45,720
No new messages.
Old messages.

422
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:46,811
(BEEPS)

423
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:49,584
JOEY: Eric, you there?
Pick up. Pick up the phone.

424
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:50,852
ERIC: Hey, Joe, I'm here.

425
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:52,223
JOEY: Got what you need?

426
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:53,784
ERIC: Yeah, I got it.
What time?

427
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,295
JOEY: 3:00.

428
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:56,728
ERIC: Don't worry,
I'll be there.

429
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:57,527
Shooting happened
right after 3:00.

430
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,794
That conversation,
they could've been

431
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:00,733
planning to meet for
a game of tiddlywinks.

432
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:04,529
I think I can prove they
had something else in mind.

433
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:08,873
Witnesses put Eric Campbell
at the register when he
demanded the money.

434
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:10,640
He turned and fired,
missed Rebecca,

435
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:13,181
and hit John Marcum
outside the store.

436
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:16,810
But when he fired
the second time and hit
Rebecca, he was standing here.

437
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,114
And you know that how?

438
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:20,348
I fired the murder weapon
at these pieces of oak tag

439
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:22,891
from ten, five
and three feet away

440
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,859
to figure out where
Eric was standing.

441
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:28,226
Then I compared the results
to the gunshot
residue on Rebecca's shirt.

442
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,933
So Eric was three feet away
when he shot Rebecca.

443
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:34,127
He moved forward.

444
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:35,932
Because the first shot
was too high.

445
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:39,668
He had to deliberately
move closer and aim Iower.

446
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,205
It's the only scenario
that matches the evidence.

447

(DOOR BELL RINGING)

448
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:47,939
Hey, Joey Field.
Yeah.

We're Detectives

450

Is this about
that Iittle girl?

451
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,512
Yeah.
Did she make it?

452
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:54,886
No, I'm sorry,
she didn't.

453
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:56,652
Can we talk to you
out here for a minute?

454
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:57,784
What for?

455
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,590
The Mayor's office sent us.
They want to give you
an award for heroism.

456
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:02,062
We just need to
fill out the paperwork.

457
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:03,996
Who is it, Joey?
It's the cops, Dad.

458
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,727
They want to give
me an award.
Joey, get back in here.

00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,565
Joey Field, you're under
arrest for the murders
of John Marcum...

460
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:09,662
MALCOLM: What are you...

461
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:10,899
...Eric Campbell
and Rebecca Kurtz.

462
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:12,406
What murders?
I didn't do anything.

463
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:14,841
Look, I'm an attorney.
Where the hell's
your arrest warrant?

464
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,935
Don't need one.
He stepped outside.

465
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:19,038
You tricked me.
Reasonable deception.
Ask your dad about it.

466
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:21,447
MALCOLM: Joseph,
don't say a word! I'II be
right down to get you out!

467
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:22,711
You have the right
to remain silent.

468
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:24,082
If you give up that right,
anything you say

469
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:26,451
can and will be used
against you in a court of Iaw.

470
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:32,583
Be nice if we could Iisten.

471
00:21:32,662 --> 00:21:36,098
It's pretty convenient having
a father who can double
as your attorney.

472
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,065
Looks Iike Joey would
rather have somebody else.

473
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:39,362
Malcolm Field's
record is good,

474
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:41,596
but I don't think even he
can get his son out of this.

475
00:21:46,742 --> 00:21:49,734
Joseph had no idea
Eric Campbell was going
to hold up that store.

476
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:51,040
You have no case.

477
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:52,478
Excuse me?

478
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:55,745
How many more people
would that bastard have killed
if my son hadn't stopped him?

479
00:21:55,818 --> 00:21:58,810
Your son raped a six-year-old
and murdered three people
to cover it up.

480
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:00,719
We have the forensics
to prove it.

481
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,282
If Joey would Iike to share
anything, Counselor,
now would be the time.

482
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,920
If you're Iooking
for a confession,
you can forget it.

483
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:09,891
No, we'II take our
chances with the jury.

484
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:20,273
"People v. Joseph Lee Field.
Three counts murder
in the First Degree,

485
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,607
"two counts rape
in the First Degree."

486
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:25,545
Counsel, approach.

487
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:32,285
What the hell's
going on, Malcolm?

488
00:22:32,355 --> 00:22:33,822
People are making
a big mistake.

489
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,186
That may be true.

490
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:37,521
But do you think
you're the best person
to represent Joey?

491
00:22:37,593 --> 00:22:40,562
Your Honor seems very well
acquainted with the counsel
and his defendant.

492
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:41,823
Relax, Ms. Cabot.

493
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:44,364
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

494
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:45,798
We can't help you
out on this.

495
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,200
Step back.

496
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:54,242
Mr. Field,
how does your client plead?

497
00:22:55,578 --> 00:22:56,704
Not guilty, Your Honor.

498
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:57,837
SELIGMAN: Bail, Ms. Cabot?

499
00:22:57,913 --> 00:23:00,507
Considering the ease
with which the accused
could flee the jurisdiction,

500
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,777
the People request remand.

501
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:03,876
Your Honor,
you have my word as
an officer of the court,

502
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:06,353
the defendant will
remain under my
personal supervision.

503
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:10,825
With all due respect
to Mr. Field, his son
is facing a capital charge.

504
00:23:10,893 --> 00:23:12,053
He shouldn't be
on the street.

505
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,062
Under the circumstances
I have to agree.

506
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:16,221
Defendant is remanded
without bail.

507
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:17,287
(GAVEL BANGS)

508
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:18,797
SELIGMAN: Next case.

509
00:23:20,102 --> 00:23:22,798
Before Missy agrees
to testify against Joey,

510
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:25,864
her parents want a guarantee
that you won't prosecute her.

511
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:28,239
Prosecute her?
She's a victim.

512
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:32,175
Yeah, and two weeks from now,
you could charge her
with rape one

513
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:34,773
for delivering her sister
to the man who raped
them both.

514
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,374
Roger, you know us
better than that.

515
00:23:36,452 --> 00:23:38,477
ROGER: Oh, hey, I trust you.

516
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:41,079
But not your new
good old boy D.A.

517
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:44,456
I mean, what's to keep Branch
from throwing her in prison
to make an example?

518
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,722
Stop blowing smoke
up my ass, Roger.

519
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:48,957
I'm just defending my client.

520
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:50,089
What do you want?

521
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,190
Immunity.

522
00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:57,639
Come on. We're giving
you Joey Field
on a silver platter.

523
00:23:58,707 --> 00:24:01,608
Are you sure she
won't be too scared
to take the stand?

524
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:03,941
Not if it gets
him the needle.

525
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:07,909
We'II send you the paperwork.

526
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:13,081
Good Iuck putting these
witnesses on the stand.

527
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:16,750
They took one Iook at Eric
in the ski mask,
and they ducked for cover.

528
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:18,191
You ready for some more?

529
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:20,193
What's this?

530
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:22,127
Malcolm Field's motion
to suppress the recording

531
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:23,563
on Eric's Campbell's
answering machine.

532
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:24,690
On what grounds?

533
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,166
Authentication,
illegal search.

534
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,965
It was Campbell's home.
Field doesn't have standing.

535
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:30,528
We still have to respond.

536
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:33,905
He could bury me in paperwork
for the next decade if he
thinks it'II save his son.

537
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:37,503
Hey, guess who
Joey Field's father is calling
as a defense witness.

538
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,880
Oh, sure. Who better
to testify that no witnesses
corroborate Missy's story.

539
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:43,714
Not to mention
his son's a hero.

540
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:46,084
Bastard's gonna hang me out
to dry in front of the jury.

541
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:47,588
This just keeps
getting better.

542
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:50,216
Well, here's more good news.

543
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:51,816
What's wrong?
It's from the Iab.

544
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:54,920
Copy of a tape Fin and Munch
found when they searched
the Fields' home.

545
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:57,863
We got a real problem.

546
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:02,568
Come on, Joey.
Do it already.

547
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:05,334
Can't we just
leave her and go?

548
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:07,534
No. She is knocked out.
She won't feel it.

549
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,101
Missy, look, okay,
I don't want to, okay?

550
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:12,613
MISSY: No, it is not okay.

551
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:39,941
MISSY: You like that?

552
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,408
JOEY: Yeah.

553
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:43,809
Yeah? You want
a little more?

554
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,472
Then you'll do
what I say.

555
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,735
If Missy Iied
about being raped,

556
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:13,639
who do you think
really planned these murders?

557
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:20,015
JOEY: I'm not saying anything.

558
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,948
CRAGEN: We watched
the tape, Joey.

559
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:25,112
Joseph, you have
to tell us the truth.

560
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:30,854
Your girlfriend set you up.
She said you raped her
and her sister.

561
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:32,622
She's blaming you
for the murders.

562
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:35,290
You're Iying.
She would never do that.

563
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:36,559
She Ioved me.

564
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:40,264
You don't understand.
You could get
the death penalty.

565
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:41,395
We know she
made you do this.

566
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:44,133
You don't know anything.
You never have.

567
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:47,268
Missy and Rebecca
both had gonorrhea.

568
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:49,405
So what?

569
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:51,276
The doctor gave you
a physical when you
got here,

570
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:53,179
and you tested negative.

571
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:54,375
Do you know what that means?

572
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,713
I don't give a damn.

573
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:59,422
Well, either you were treated,
or Missy has been sleeping
with someone else.

574
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:02,047
I don't believe you.

575
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:07,425
Do you really want to
protect somebody who
was cheating on you?

576
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,533
She'd never do that.

577
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:16,334
Well, then how did she
and Rebecca get gonorrhea
and you didn't?

578
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:21,139
She got it from somebody else,
and then she gave it
to her sister.

579
00:27:24,914 --> 00:27:27,314
Can't you see what
she's doing to you?

580
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:40,256
I met Eric at the video store,

581
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:43,293
and he introduced me to Missy.

582
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:47,500
I just... I'd never
been with anybody Iike her.

583
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:50,433
It's Iike being high.

584
00:27:51,107 --> 00:27:53,041
My brain just stopped working.

585
00:27:53,543 --> 00:27:55,374
What did Missy
do to Rebecca?

586
00:27:56,646 --> 00:28:00,309
She would drug her,
and then she would...

587
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:03,748
She would do things to her.

588
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:07,682
And one time,
Rebecca woke up.

589
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:09,956
Said that she
was going to tell.

590
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:11,857
And you had to kill Rebecca
to keep her quiet.

591
00:28:11,928 --> 00:28:15,227
No. No, I told Missy
I didn't want to.

592
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:17,732
And she said that Eric
would do anything for money.

593
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:20,702
So she paid him,
and I told him what to do.

594
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:24,535
Whose idea was the robbery?

595
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:29,010
Missy's. See, I mentioned once
that my boss kept a gun under
the counter.

596
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,603
She said she'd drop
some tapes to make noise,

597
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,807
make it Iook Iike
Eric had freaked out.

598
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:38,914
And then, he would shoot...
He would shoot Rebecca,

599
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:44,388
and then I would shoot him,
and nobody could trace it
back to us.

600
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,696
(SOBBING)

601
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,694
Tell me this isn't
as bad as it seems.

602
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:53,793
Oh, it is.

603
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,667
And Missy's immunity
is etched in stone?

604
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:58,139
We can't touch her.
We're screwed.

605
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:07,104
Branch okayed the death
penalty motion on Joey Field.

606
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:09,745
Great.

607
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:12,916
AIex.

608
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:16,416
Give it a rest.

609
00:29:17,227 --> 00:29:19,161
She played us, Liz.

610
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:22,528
This office,
the police, her own parents.

611
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,932
Missy used Joey to murder
her own sister, and now
she's killing him, too.

612
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:29,836
We dealt ourselves
this hand, and it's
all we've got to play.

613
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,473
Maybe not.

614
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,339
You can't reverse
Missy's immunity.

615
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,207
A judge can.

616
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,214
No judge is going to give us
a second chance.

617
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:43,143
Unless someone else
makes the argument for us.

618
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:46,016
Mr. Field,
we need your help.

619
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:47,647
What, to execute
my son?

620
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:49,248
To reverse Missy
Kurtz's immunity.

621
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:51,316
Well, Missy's immunity
helps my case.

622
00:29:51,394 --> 00:29:53,157
You can't put her on
the stand because you
know she'II Iie,

623
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:55,129
and without her,
all your physical evidence
is circumstantial.

624
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:56,790
Do you really think
a jury is going to care?

625
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:58,800
Look, Missy's the only one
who can testify to motive.

626
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:00,165
A jury's going to
want to hear that.

627
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:01,897
A jury is going to
want to punish somebody

628
00:30:01,971 --> 00:30:04,701
for the rape and murder
of a six-year-old child.

629
00:30:04,774 --> 00:30:08,335
Your son is the only person
sitting at the defense table.

630
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:13,477
I did such a good job
as a father,
my son despises me.

631
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:16,516
He won't even
Iet me save him.

632
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:19,084
You still can.

633
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:23,649
The D.A. is willing to take
the death penalty off
the table. Work with us.

634
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,760
What are we doing here?
My client has immunity.

635
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:34,064
PETROVSKY: I agree.

636
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:37,638
I've seen the tape,
but it doesn't
change anything.

637
00:30:37,707 --> 00:30:40,141
The evidence turned up
after immunity was imposed.

638
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,404
That's not our problem.

639
00:30:41,477 --> 00:30:43,775
It is our problem.
Your Honor.

640
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:46,247
You know I can't
reverse immunity,
Mr. Field.

641
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:49,649
Unless it violates
my client's due process
right to a fair trial.

642
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,482
People v. Osorio.

643
00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:53,249
Osorio isn't on point.

644
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:54,449
Sure it is, Judge.

645
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:57,391
The People can't put
Missy Kurtz on the stand
without suborning perjury.

646
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,587
That means my client can't
confront his accuser,

647
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:01,653
which is a violation
of the Sixth Amendment.

648
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:05,098
Ms. Cabot?

649
00:31:06,436 --> 00:31:08,734
The People made a mistake.
We're not going to deny it.

650
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:11,535
How about you
colluding with the defense
to railroad my client?

651
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,166
You gonna deny that?

652
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:17,646
That may be the case,
Mr. Kressler, but you'd have
a hard time proving it.

653
00:31:17,714 --> 00:31:19,306
You can't do this.

654
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:21,942
I can. And I am.

655
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:27,188
The immunity agreement between
the People and Missy Kurtz
is void.

656
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:29,157
Thank you, Your Honor.

657
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:35,520
Stick around, Ms. Cabot.

658
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:37,724
(DOOR CLOSING)

659
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,566
Aren't you going to thank me
for cleaning up your mess,
AIexandra?

660
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:43,731
Mr. Field made
a valid Iegal argument.

661
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,865
Which you handed him.

662
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:49,571
I'm tired of you
manipulating my court
to suit your needs.

663
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:51,703
I'm keeping this
case for trial.

664
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:54,579
When can I expect to see
an indictment on Missy Kurtz?

665
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:57,119
We'II begin working
on the rape immediately.

666
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:58,517
And the three murders?

667
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:00,613
Insufficient evidence,
Your Honor.
We're just not ready to...

668
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,423
You're telling me that you
jeopardized my judicial
record, and you're not ready?

669
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:08,396
You sure as hell better be.
By tomorrow.

670
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:18,972
A search warrant
for the Kurtz's home.
PIease, find me something.

671
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,942
Why? Because some judge
put you in the jackpot?

672
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,500
Sorry.
I'm not blaming anyone.

673
00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:24,045
Is Missy in interrogation?

674
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:25,341
STABLER: Yeah,
with her Iawyer.

675
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:27,474
Let me see if I can
get myself out of this.

676
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:31,784
She must've really
pushed Petrovsky's buttons.

677
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:33,788
Yeah, while Missy
pushes everyone else's.

678
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,752
Including her parents.

679
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:37,019
You arrested Missy?

680
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:39,823
Mr. Kurtz, Mrs. Kurtz,
why don't we go someplace
where we can talk?

681
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,454
RAQUEL: Why? Are you going
to arrest us, too?

682
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:43,021
Excuse me.
What's going on here?

683
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:45,863
You couldn't build your case
against this animal,
so you go after Missy?

684
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:47,425
Joey Field.

685
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:52,265
Joey Field raped Rebecca
because Missy told him to.

686
00:32:52,342 --> 00:32:54,572
The murders were Missy's idea.

687
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:56,668
Missy was raped
by that bastard.

688
00:32:56,746 --> 00:32:58,737
I'm afraid the evidence
proves otherwise.

689
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,907
What evidence?
I want to see it.

690
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:03,612
We really don't want to make
this any harder than it has
to be.

691
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:05,210
What could be harder?

692
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,087
Show them.

693
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:15,163
You like that?

694
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,664
Yeah.

695
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:19,065
Yeah? You want
a little more?

696
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:22,796
Then you'll do what I say.

697
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:26,533
That's enough. Turn it off.
Turn it off!

698
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,543
AII right.
Why?

699
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:32,172
We Ioved that girl
from the moment she
came into our home!

700
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:34,148
That bastard gave
them both gonorrhea?

701
00:33:34,217 --> 00:33:36,378
No, Mr. Kurtz,
he didn't.

702
00:33:36,452 --> 00:33:37,680
Joey never had it.

703
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:43,783
My God. Missy gave it
to Rebecca?

704
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:48,755
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

705
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,828
How didn't we see?

706
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:56,394
Because Missy made
sure that you wouldn't.

707
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:02,007
What do we do now? What now?

708
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:07,677
We need your help.

709
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:12,779
Joey says Missy
paid Eric Campbell
$1,000 to shoot Rebecca.

710
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:16,387
Any ideas where
she could have gotten
that kind of money?

711
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:28,600
Missy murdered Rebecca
just as surely as if she had
pulled the trigger herself.

712
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:30,536
Now, whatever you know,

713
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:35,907
you can't Iet her
get away with this.

714
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:41,172
PETER: What she did
was reprehensible.

715
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,878
But you've
gotta understand.

716
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:47,554
We've just Iost
one daughter.

717
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:52,758
You can't ask us to help you
take the other one.

718
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:00,602
So we here
to talk a deal?

719
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,503
Why? Your client
want to plead?

720
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:06,371
Sure. How about
sexual misconduct?

721
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:08,569
On an A misdemeanor?

722
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:10,942
Your client worked
in concert with Joey Field.

723
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:14,608
Then she raped her sister,
then she murdered her sister
and two other people.

724
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:17,414
You can't prove that
she killed anybody.

725
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:21,955
We have you on tape
abusing your sister.

726
00:35:22,024 --> 00:35:23,491
You both had gonorrhea.

727
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:26,118
We checked your parents'
phone records,

728
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:28,390
and you and Eric Campbell
spent a Iot of time chatting.

729
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:29,897
It's all circumstantial.

730
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:33,201
Not when Joey Field ties it
together on the stand.

731
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:36,697
Joey's not going
to testify against me.

732
00:35:36,772 --> 00:35:37,864
He Ioves me.

733
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,635
Joey told us everything.

734
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:41,472
He knows you've
been sleeping around.

735
00:35:41,544 --> 00:35:44,012
ROGER: He's a Iove-crazed
teenager.

736
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,571
When Rebecca threatened
to tell her parents,

737
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:49,015
Joey couldn't bear the thought
of Missy Ieaving him,

738
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:52,384
so he hired Eric Campbell
to murder Rebecca,

739
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:54,320
and then he murdered
him to shut him up.

740
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,018
He did what Missy
told him to do.

741
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:01,688
And after a jury hears that
Missy was repeatedly raped

742
00:36:01,764 --> 00:36:05,200
by her biological
father and his friends,

743
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:08,294
do you think they're going
to hold her responsible
for any of this?

744
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:14,299
So, Missy still thinks
she's got us over a barrel?

745
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:16,675
She's right.
I can't mention
the murders at trial,

746
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:18,077
and even her calls
to Eric Campbell

747
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:19,978
don't definitively
prove it was her idea.

748
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:23,541
And Kressler puts
Joey Field on trial,
it's he said, she said.

749
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:27,248
He's setting her up to plead
not guilty by reason of mental
disease or defect.

750
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,052
Let's call a psychiatrist.

751
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,486
I'II send Huang over
to Rikers to see her.

752
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:35,660
Tell me about your
biological father.

753
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:36,925
You read the file.

754
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,194
I want to hear it from you.

755
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:41,632
My mother died
when I was five.

756
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:44,070
They said that's
when my father started
having sex with me.

757
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,500
What do you remember
about the abuse?

758
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:49,337
It hurt.

759
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:51,779
But as Iong as I cried,
I didn't get hit.

760
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:56,014
How did it feel when they
took you away from him?

761
00:36:57,486 --> 00:36:59,147
At first, I was glad.

762
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:02,521
Then after they moved me
the third time, it didn't
make any difference.

763
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,924
The Kurtzs adopted you.
That must have
made a difference.

764
00:37:04,994 --> 00:37:06,325
Yeah, right.

765
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:07,862
The Kurtzs wanted
their own kid.

766
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,625
Once Rebecca was born,
they didn't want me
around anymore.

767
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:11,257
They just kept me
out of pity.

768
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:14,426
That's not what
they told us.

769
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:16,733
Yeah, well.
People say they Iove you,
but they really don't.

770
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:19,431
Joey Ioves you.

771
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:21,135
Joey Ioves sex.

772
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:26,075
He was ready to face
the death penalty for you.

773
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:30,344
But he didn't, did he?

774
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:36,021
He's out for himself,
just Iike everybody else.

775
00:37:37,593 --> 00:37:41,791
Missy has flat affect,
minimal insight,
and no capacity for empathy.

776
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:45,129
So she's a sociopath.
That doesn't make for
a Iegit psychiatric defense.

777
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:47,931
Kressler will spin it
as untreated post-traumatic
stress disorder

778
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,471
with dissociative features.

779
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:51,403
Her early childhood
was severely traumatic.

780
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:53,465
Without immediate
intensive therapy,

781
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:55,510
no way she could form
healthy attachments.

782
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:57,705
By the time
the Kurtzs adopted her,
it was too Iate.

783
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,011
So Missy's mad, not bad,
and Daddy takes the rap.

784
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:04,052
Missy didn't get the therapy
that she needed.
That's not her fault.

785
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,849
HUANG: Well, it doesn't
excuse her behavior.

786
00:38:05,921 --> 00:38:08,617
Missy knew what she
was doing was wrong.
She just didn't care.

787
00:38:10,593 --> 00:38:12,151
It's too bad
her father's dead.

788
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:13,627
I'd Iove to prosecute him.

789
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:15,720
MUNCH: Look at this.

790
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:17,157
Where have you two been?

791
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:18,791
Searching
Eric Campbell's room.

792
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:20,597
Whatever Missy paid him
must've burned a hole

793
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,535
in his pocket
at the electronics store.

794
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:24,539
We know whether Missy
has her own money?

795
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:27,508
Couple of hundred
in her checking account,
no recent withdrawals.

796
00:38:27,576 --> 00:38:28,702
Same with the parents.

797
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:30,507
Missy probably
never even asked them.

798
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,376
You're a teenager,
you need some quick cash

799
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,211
and you can't ask
your parents,
what are you gonna do?

800
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:36,478
You're either gonna
borrow it or steal it.

801
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:38,713
Or sell something valuable.

802
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:43,081
Or give something
to the hit man
in Iieu of cash.

803
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,524
Something jog your memory?

804
00:38:44,593 --> 00:38:47,960
We found a half a pawn ticket
in Eric Campbell's room.

805
00:38:49,332 --> 00:38:51,163
Dated two days
before the murder.

806
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,130
AL: Where'd you get this?
FIN: A dead man.

807
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:58,264
How'd he get dead?

808
00:38:58,341 --> 00:38:59,603
Somebody shot him.

809
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:02,269
You got any more questions,
AI, or you gonna show us
the merchandise?

810
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:04,438
Today's your Iucky day.

811
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:06,504
Is it real?
You kidding?

812
00:39:06,982 --> 00:39:09,815
This is white gold.
The chain Iooks the same.

813
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:11,785
Half a karat
of pav� diamonds.

814
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:13,719
Look at you.
A connoisseur.

815
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:16,919
It's gotta be worth
at Ieast $3,000.

816
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,426
Dumb punk who brought it in
gave it to me for a grand.

817
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:21,622
There's even an inscription
on the back.

818
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:26,359
CABOT: "To Missy with Iove,
from Mom and Dad."

819
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:27,629
What's this?

820
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:29,933
Jewelry your client
gave to Eric Campbell.

821
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:32,098
Payment for his services
as a hit man.

822
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:33,402
So?

823
00:39:33,476 --> 00:39:37,435
We have a sworn statement
ID-ing Eric as the man who
pawned this pendant.

824
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,807
Joey stole it
and gave it to Eric.

825
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,578
A jury is never going
to believe that, Missy.

826
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:45,415
You can't prove it
didn't happen that way.

827
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,480
Do you want to
explain it to her?
What can we do here?

828
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:50,548
Joey got Eric
to kill Rebecca.

829
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:52,724
Joey shot Eric.

830
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:55,593
Joey's going to get
the death penalty.

831
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:59,532
No. We made a deal with Joey.

832
00:40:00,803 --> 00:40:05,797
Joey is going to plead guilty
and go to prison after he
testifies against you.

833
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:09,845
You are getting
the death penalty
for murdering your sister.

834
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:11,402
She wasn't my sister.

835
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,289
Rebecca was an innocent,
six-year-old child.

836
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:30,922
You think I'm
supposed to feel sad?

837
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:34,066
Scared?

838
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:37,163
I don't.

839
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:43,540
You can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

840
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,994
Ms. Cabot.

841
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:04,824
Missy's Iawyer told us
the D.A.'s going
for the death penalty.

842
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:08,000
I know.

843
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,800
Well, there's gotta be
something you can do.

844
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:13,740
I'm sorry, Mr. Kurtz.
It's out of my hands.

845
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:19,037
Ms. Cabot, killing her
won't bring Becca back.

846
00:41:21,317 --> 00:41:24,514
It is my job to
speak for the victims.

847
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:32,817
Ms. Cabot, can't you see
how damaged Missy is?

848
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,094
Yes. Yes, I can.

849
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:41,869
Well then,
why can't you just
put her in prison?

850
00:41:41,937 --> 00:41:44,497
Because I have
to follow the Iaw.
