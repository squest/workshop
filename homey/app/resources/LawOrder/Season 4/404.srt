NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,203 --> 00:00:04,866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:08,906
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:12,671
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:14,716
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:18,880
I told you that dog trainer
was a waste of money.

8
00:00:18,954 --> 00:00:20,785
You gotta give her
the special whistle.

Radio! See?
She Iistens to me. Radio!

11
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:27,118
(CONTINUES BARKING)
Radio, come!

12
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,756
Instead of obedience school,
I could've bought
a flat-screen TV.

13
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:32,800
Oh, my God.
What is it?

14
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:33,960
Doug!

15
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:35,970
Oh, God. Oh, no.

16
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:38,165
Call 911.
Oh, God.

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,434
Radio.

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:42,936
DOUG: We walk Radio here
every morning.

19
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:45,377
So you might know
if she's a regular?

20
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:46,846
No. Her face
was such a mess,

21
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:48,974
you couldn't even tell
what she Iooked Iike.

22
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,487
Sorry, Detective.
I wish we could be
more helpful.

23
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,078
If anything
comes to mind.

24
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:55,384
Ray.
Yeah?

25
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:56,617
Walk these two
out for me, will you?

26
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,022
Sure thing, Munch.
Thanks.

27
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,390
RAY: AII right.
Come on, Iet's go.

(SIREN WAILING)
Over by the benches.
Keep moving.

29
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,025
Looks Iike she's
in her 50s or 60s.

30
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,260
The only ID
is a key on a string.

31
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:08,700
Any Iuck?
The guys saw nothing.

32
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,759
What about her?

33
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:12,068
Beaten, stabbed,
the whole nine.

34
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,165
Body's still warm.

35
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:18,745
What he did to her face
he repeated down below.
Check this out.

36
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:21,872
It's a dog's paw print.

37
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,542
Too small to be
that retriever's.

38
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:26,485
Yeah, well,
she carries dog treats.

39
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:29,913
Maybe the print
belonged to her own pooch.

40
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,424
MAN: Detectives,
check this out.

41
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:33,723
BIoody knife
wrapped in plastic.

42
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,055
We're not gonna be able
to get any prints
off that bag.

43
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,124
What's that?
What?

44
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:45,901
Disposable rain poncho.

45
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:48,499
He used it
to protect himself
from the spatter.

46
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,545
Bright, sunny day,
nobody notices the guy.

47
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:51,977
Just another freak
in the big city.

48
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:55,448
So where's this pup
while its master's
getting mauled?

49
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:57,579
Tied to this tree.

50
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:00,946
No tags.
Dog wiggles free.

51
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,853
Runs to her
and Ieaves the paw print.

52
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,186
And doesn't stay.

53
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,523
Maybe Lassie
went to get help.

54
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:58,006
Thirty-seven
deep puncture wounds

55
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,013
to the chest,
mostly on the breasts.

56
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:01,480
Angry son of a bitch.

57
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,040
Acute pneumothorax.

58
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,551
She drowned
in her own blood.

59
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,143
Did the perp Ieave
his calling card?

60
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,449
No fluids.

61
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,423
But the vaginal wounds
had wooden splinters.

62
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,187
Matches the bark
from this branch

63
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,024
we found at the scene.

64
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:16,393
BIood belongs to the victim.

65
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:17,453
Any Iuck with the prints?

66
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,556
Nothing yet.

67
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,328
We'II need to do
a facial reconstruction.

68
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:22,734
He smashed her nose,
cheekbones, jaw.

69
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,772
One eye was
completely destroyed.

70
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,807
She was also wearing this.

71
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,510
Wow. That's some ring.

72
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,444
Whoever married her
has some bucks.

73
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,779
Well, I hope
he misses her soon.

74
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:35,941
We'II check
the diamond district,

75
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,951
see if anyone recognizes
the craftsmanship.

76
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,249
This might speed things up.

77
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:42,552
Look for a missing woman
in her 60s with a Iimp.

78
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:43,784
How'd you get that?

79
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:46,383
Her right Ieg
is one inch shorter
than the Ieft,

80
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:48,622
probably from
childhood polio.

81
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:51,257
Vaccine didn't
come out till 1954.

82
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,493
So, we're talking
classic overkill.

83
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,402
M.E. says that any one
of the puncture wounds
would've done the job.

84
00:03:57,472 --> 00:04:00,066
Perp wanted her to suffer
and got off on it.

85
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,130
GIad you could join us.

86
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,370
Sorry, parent-teacher
conference ran Iate.

87
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:04,503
Read it and weep.

88
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,876
Guy could be
some psycho

89
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,539
high after a night
of fun and games.

90
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:09,709
Or a deluded park dweller
who forgot to take his meds.

91
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,684
Or it's personal.

92
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,584
Poncho,
that feels premeditated.

93
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:14,781
What do we know about her?

94
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,187
CRAGEN: She's a Jane Doe
in the park.

95
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:18,192
Which is why
I don't have time
for theories.

96
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,194
The media is already
breathing down my neck.

97
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:21,456
You gotta give me
something solid.

98
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,553
There's nothing to tell.

99
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,620
Central Park precinct

100
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,598
said that there's no assault
that matches the MO.

101
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,066
There's no open rapes.

102
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:29,467
Animal control
is reaching out
to vets and shelters.

103
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,266
Pretty brazen
for broad daylight.

104
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,398
I mean,
with this much rage,

105
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:34,874
maybe the perp
did it before.

106
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,774
We should check MOs
on assaults on older women.

107
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:38,039
I'II get a citywide run.

108
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:39,512
You two,
go back to the park,

109
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,378
take as much help
as you need.

110
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,907
Joggers have routines.
Maybe somebody knew her.

111
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,510
That was the pet police.

112
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:49,523
Pooch was brought to a vet
with bloody paws.

113
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,358
Joggers found him
in the park, all bloody.

114
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:54,156
Thought he was hurt,
brought him here.

115
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,628
And you washed the blood off?

116
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:57,756
Only way to see
if he was injured.

117
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,026
Any ID?

118
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,124
Nothing.

119
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,403
No tattoo, no microchip.
Microchip?

120
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,434
Implanted subcutaneously,

121
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,840
programmed with
the owner's name
and phone number.

122
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:12,078
Stray comes in,
we scan for them first thing.

123
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:14,411
BIood's gone,
so is our evidence.

124
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,245
Sorry,

125
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:20,519
but I kept this.

126
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:24,521
Had it in his mouth
when he came in.

127
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:26,253
Dogs Iove shoes.

128
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:28,621
It's 'cause it's got
your mommy's scent on it, huh?

129
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:31,666
It's the right sneaker
from her shorter Ieg.

130
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,627
That's why she needed this.

131
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,033
Orthodic insert,
kept everything evened out.

132
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:39,971
MUNCH:
Manufactured by Ortho-Walk.

133
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,204
We're gonna take the shoe
and the dog. Thanks.

134
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,309
It's our work, all right.
Where did you get it?

135
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:51,215
Off the foot
of an unidentified
murder victim.

136
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:52,275
Do you know
who you made it for?

137
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:53,378
It's easy to find out.

138
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:58,757
Each one has a serial number.
Let's see, number AV-0419.

139
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,324
I told you, you should've Ieft
that mutt in the car.

140
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:03,387
Do you know how many dogs
die in Iocked cars every year?

141
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:06,866
You know how many cops
shoot their partner
and get off on a justifiable?

142
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:09,699
Oh, dear,
it belongs to Dr. Esterman.

143
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,706
Doctor?
Works for the
Department of Health.

144
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,807
This our witness?

145
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,003
First time
I ever printed a dog.

146
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,604
Paw print is a match
to the one
on the victim's body.

147
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,978
What's with the swab?

148
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,677
Dog broke Ioose,
maybe chased the perp
and got a piece of him.

149
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:25,014
I'II run everything
through Serology,

150
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:26,519
check for human DNA,

151
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:28,419
but it Iooks Iike Fido there
got a good bath.

She Iives at
3 West 89th Street.

154
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:34,554
Got a next of kin?

155
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,859
Husband's name is Arthur,
some kind of society Iawyer.

156
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:39,491
Okay, we'II
make notification.

157
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,396

forgetting someone?

00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:55,777
I never should've Iet
Greta go out alone.

160
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:59,880
BENSON: Mr. Esterman,
we have to ask you this.

161
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:01,546
Where were you
this morning?

162
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:07,156
I didn't Ieave the house
until 9:00 to play tennis.

163
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,253
Weren't you worried
when your wife
didn't come home

164
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,423
from the park?

165
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,297
Since I retired
from my Iaw firm,

166
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:18,434
I've found a new vice,
sleeping Iate.

167
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:21,600
Greta always dresses
in the other room,

168
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:23,906
so she doesn't wake me.

169
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,913
BENSON: And the dog?

170
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:29,108
ARTHUR: She often takes
Buddy to work.

171
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:30,446
It's 10:00 right now.

172
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,486
You weren't worried
what might've happened to her?

173
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:34,249
Greta's been
working Iate recently.

174
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:35,880
I didn't think
anything about it.

175
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,254
What kind of work did she do?

176
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:39,793
She treated people
with HIV.

177
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,796
Greta traced the source
of exposure patterns.

178
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:46,463
Some people thought her work
violated their privacy.

179
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,860
Probably made some enemies.

180
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:51,496
The nature
of the attack suggests

181
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:54,235
the killer may
have known your wife.

182
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:58,341
Anyone have
a vendetta against her,

183
00:07:58,413 --> 00:07:59,778
or make any threats?

184
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:02,078
Occasionally, over the years.

185
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:05,848
But Iast month,
she got a threatening
phone call.

186
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,047
I heard the man's voice.

187
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:09,248
He called on your home phone?

188
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:10,757
No. No, Greta's office.

189
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,452
I was waiting to take her
to Iunch when the phone rang.

190
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:15,462
I thought it might be Greta,
so I answered.

191
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:17,389
The guy was a Iunatic,

192
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:22,027
said she'd ruined his Iife,
so he was going to ruin hers.

193
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:26,531
She got a Iot
of nasty calls.
Hate mail, too.

194
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,400
Contact tracers
are about as popular
as repo men.

195
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,775
When you inform people
they've been exposed to HIV,

196
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,177
they want to know by whom.

197
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:35,716
We can't tell them,
so things can get
pretty heated.

198
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,183
Anyone ever go
beyond threats?
Get physical?

199
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:39,811
Nasty incident Iast year.

200
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:42,755
Guy set his pit bull
on one of our tracers.

201
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:45,292
Didn't stop Greta.
She was dedicated.

202
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,521
She just gave her staff
pepper spray.

203
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,994
Here's her office.

204
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,758
Commissioner,
we're gonna need
a Iist of the cases

205
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:52,595
where there were any
threats of violence.

206
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:53,861
I wanna help,

207
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:56,927
but the names
of AIDS patients
are confidential.

208
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,563
So, how about the hate mail?

209
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,505
That's not private,
it's evidence.

210
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:03,510
I've got all her
personal papers
right here.

211
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:06,412
I'II also give you
her phone Iog.

212
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,506
Greta installed
caller ID Iast year,

213
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,914
noted everything.

214
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,743
Ever have these threats
checked out?

215
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,287
I wanted to,
but Greta talked me out of it.

216
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,346
She said
anger's a normal response,

217
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:18,415
they'd move on to acceptance.

218
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:21,824
STABLER: Estermans were quite
the social couple.

219
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:24,888
Fire and Ice Ball
for breast cancer,

220
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,900
black-tie fundraiser
for the city blood bank.

221
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:27,992
They donated 20 grand,

222
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:31,004
they each gave a pint of blood
to kick off the drive.

223
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,974
Last month, the AIDS activists
threw pig's blood on her,
protesting her policies.

224
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:38,240
How about this?
"Snoopy bitch doctor,
you die."

225
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:40,947
Hey, Esterman's story
check out?

226
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:42,607
Neighbor saw him Ieave
just after 9:00,

227
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:44,618
and he showed up
to his tennis game on time.

228
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:45,675
Find anything?

229
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,516
Yeah, Iots of angry people.

230
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:49,648
She's trying to save Iives,
and they hate her for it.

231
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:52,693
There's a fine Iine
between the right
to privacy and prevention.

232
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,853
People have a right
to know if they've been
exposed to HIV.

233
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:55,987
I just get
a Iittle nervous

234
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:57,656
when the government
starts drawing up Iists.

235
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:58,926
PIease don't
get him started.

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,399
He goes off
on black helicopters,

237
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:02,629
and we'II be here all night.

238
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:05,172

"that he will
copulate me to death."

00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:12,640
That's pretty much
what happened.

Yeah, I do.
Roger Pomerantz.

245
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:20,284
So, she knew who called,
why didn't she turn him in?

246
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:22,915
You remember Greta's boss
said she was a true believer.

247
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:25,653
Maybe she saw this guy
as a patient, not a problem.

248
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:28,093
Maybe she wound up dead,
thinking Iike that.

Roger Pomerantz,

Menacing, gun charges,

Knifepoint stranger rape.

that I have gonorrhea.

So, you're stupid enough
to get the clap?

The Iaw says that Dr. Esterman
had to tell her.

284
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:11,125
So you called up the doc
to Iet her know
exactly how you felt, right?

I was at the diner,

with the guys,

00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:45,295
and then we all drove
to work together.

checked out.

Waitress at

305
00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:59,576
Pomerantz and his two boys
clocked in at 8:00.

306
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:00,807
No time for a detour.

What can we
do for you?

311
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,587
POMERANTZ: I told you
I never touched that old Iady.

312
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:12,649
I should sue both of you
for false arrest.

Sweetheart, you were
never under arrest.

314
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,119
So Iet me go.

315
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:16,220
Murderer!

316
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,423
STABLER: You forgot to call
your parole officer,

317
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:18,624
and he really
wants to see you.

318
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:19,723
Get that guy!

319
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,393
Come on, break them up!
I'II kill you!

320
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,766
I wanna press charges.

321
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:23,826
I wanna press charges.

322
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:24,929
SERGEANT: Get in there.
Get in there!

323
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:26,871
PIease, we're doing
everything we can,
Mr. Esterman.

324
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:29,273
I want you to go home
and Iet us do our job.

325
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,743
I found something
that could help.

326
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:34,145
CRAGEN: Take Mr. Esterman
to the Iounge.

327
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,373
Forty years of marriage,
I don't know how
to sleep alone.

328
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,612
I was just wandering
around the apartment.

329
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:41,951
I found my way
into Greta's study,

330
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:44,514
to be closer to her,
and then I remembered.

331
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:47,192
Greta brought work home
Iast week.

332
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,957
She was worried
about this case.

333
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,425
Any idea
what this means?

334
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,992
Greta said it had to do
with a terrible situation
she had to stop.

335
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,799
She didn't tell you
what it was about?

336
00:13:57,872 --> 00:14:00,670
Greta didn't talk much
about her work.

337
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,402
I guess this
won't do any good

338
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:04,467
if nobody can translate it.

339
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:09,644
We have someone
who might be able
to help us out.

340
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:10,775
Took me most of the night,

341
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:13,719
but I figured out
what Dr. Esterman
was working on.

342
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:15,585
Looks Iike a bunch
of circles and arrows.

343
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,648
Tell me about it.
I've been seeing circles
and arrows all night.

344
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:21,524
What it is,
is a contact trace.

345
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,996
Each circle represents
a person with HIV,

346
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,398
connected to the partner
that gave it to them.

347
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:28,901
Greta was trying to identify

348
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,961
the common source
of infection.

349
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,132
So, you're saying that
all these cases are connected?

350
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,903
WARNER: Greta thought so.

351
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:38,377
These people
all Iive in Little Italy,

352
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,004
but most of them
don't know each other.

353
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:42,140
You think she was Iooking
for an HIV positive guy

354
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,615
who had sex
with Iots of partners.

355
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:45,618
And they, in turn,
had sex with other people,

356
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:47,916
and pretty soon,
you got dozens
infected with HIV

357
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,048
all because of
that first guy.

358
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,614
We call him the nexus.

359
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,092
He's the center
of this mini-epidemic.

360
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,560
Sounds to me Iike a sociopath

361
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,155
who's not concerned
with how many people
he infects.

362
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,700
Guys in St. Louis
and Jamestown

363
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:01,928
were prosecuted for that.

364
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,164
Right. They knew
they were infected with HIV,

365
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,705
but still had unprotected sex

366
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,104
without warning
their partners.

367
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:10,075
Well, if this nexus thought
Greta was close to IDing him,

368
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:11,372
that'd be a good motive
for murder.

369
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,673
Well, a couple
of Greta's death threats

370
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,647
came from pay phones
in Little Italy.

371
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,478
Let's pick up
the investigation
where she Ieft off

372
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,881
and maybe we'II get Iucky.

373
00:15:17,952 --> 00:15:20,182
Greta had a couple people
Ieft to interview.

374
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,585
Here's the Iist.

375
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:24,454
Starts with
a college student,
Mike Andretti.

376
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,794
Mike, why didn't you
wear a condom?
I'm Catholic.

377
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:32,492
My mom
catches me with one,
I'm dead.

378
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:33,624
Now I'm dead anyway.

379
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:34,929
That's not true.

380
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,436
There are new drugs,
people Iead full Iives.

381
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,099
I'm talking about
if my mom
ever finds out.

382
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,664
Who'd you sleep with?

383
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,302
This totally hot woman
from my friend's building.

384
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,539
She was all over me,

385
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,707
said her husband didn't know
what he was missing.

386
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,614
BENSON: Is she
the first sexual partner
you ever had?

387
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:51,743
Yeah.

388
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:57,515
I swear.

389
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,058
We're gonna need her name.

390
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,788
You talk to her,
the whole neighborhood's
gonna find out.

391
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:04,127
BENSON: She might not
even know she's sick.

392
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,826
She Iooked fine.

393
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:11,932
Her name's Vincenza Agosto.

394
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,343
It's all that bastard
Joey's fault.

395
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:17,503
Who's Joey?

396
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:20,314
He'II be my dead husband
if I ever get my hands on him.

397
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:22,509
Where's Joey now?

398
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,552
With that stripper
he's been banging.

399
00:16:25,988 --> 00:16:27,853
Does he know
you have HIV?

400
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:33,861
Lucky son of a bitch
didn't get it.

401
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,954
Man upstairs
has a sick sense of humor.

402
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,726
Who infected you?

403
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:43,536
Month before the wedding,
I cut Joey off.

404
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:44,594
You know,
wait till we're married,

405
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:46,971
save some energy
for the honeymoon.

406
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,805
Joey's, Iike,
"Sure, no problem."

407
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,607
Yeah, it's 'cause
he had that slut on the side.

408
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,011
How'd you find out?

409
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:54,810
We get back
from Niagara Falls,

410
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:57,044
he's given me chlamydia.

411
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:59,610
I confront Joey about it,
he admits it.

412
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:02,282
I'm so pissed,
I figure I'II show him.

413
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:04,120
How many guys
did you sleep with?

414
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,887
Just that college kid, Mike.

415
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:08,259
He swears he got it
from you.

416
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:11,327
Who else?

417
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:17,695
This guy, Mario.
Bartender at a club.

418
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:24,936
No Mario ever worked here.

419
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:26,105
Mario tell you
to say that?

420
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,411
Hey, man, it's Iike
I told everybody else.

421
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:30,041
Who else
did you tell?

422
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:31,312
Nobody.

423
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,081
Did you tell her?

424
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:36,149
Oh, right, the doctor.
She wouldn't say
what it was about.

425
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,055
I just figured
it was some kind
of paternity thing.

426
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:39,855
Wrong.
Well, what's it about, then?

427
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:40,986
FIN: Health Department.

428
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:43,395
Looking for people
who spread HIV.

429
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,329
You mean AIDS?

430
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:49,461
You're pretty shook up
for somebody that
doesn't know any Mario.

431
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,064
He quit working here
a couple weeks ago

432
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:55,166
after the doctor came around.

433
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:56,608
You and him share girls?

434
00:17:56,678 --> 00:17:59,772
No, Mario, he's too far
out there for me, man.

435
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:01,748
This guy's into orgies,
threesomes, you know,

436
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:04,251
another girl, another guy,
anything to get off.

437
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,549
FIN: Then why you Iook
so spooked?

438
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:10,384
You and him shared needles.

439
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,257
Yeah, but not dope.
Image enhancers.

440
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:15,387
You mean steroids?
Yeah.

441
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:17,295
Now I'm gonna
have to get tested, right?

442
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,026
I'm really screwed
here, guys.

443
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:20,295
So is everybody
you ever slept with.

444
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:22,563
We're gonna
need a Iist.

445
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:27,371
Dr. Esterman
identified 47 cases

446
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:30,070
within five distinct clusters
before she was killed.

447
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:32,113
Find anything else?

448
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,616
We continued her trace
and we picked up
32 more cases.

449
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:38,482
The nexus
appears to be one man.

450
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,748
Enter Mario Molinari.

451
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:43,086
Twelve women, two men
connect directly to him.

452
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:45,718
The rest are sexual partners
of his sexual partners.

453
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:48,592
Promiscuous,
sexually indiscriminate
and infected.

454
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,790
This one-man epidemic
have any priors?

455
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:54,302
Assault, rob one,
weapons possession,

456
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:55,461
and it was a knife.

457
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:56,526
Guy's from the neighborhood.

458
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,630
He has an apartment
on Hester Street.

459
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:01,335
Well, Iet's go find
Typhoid Mario.

460
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:05,235
Sure I know Mario,
who doesn't?

461
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,645
Popular guy, Iot of girls
come Iooking for him.

462
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:08,876
You're not the first.

463
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,110
She one of them?

464
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,016
No. No, young girls, pretty.

465
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:14,746
Madonna, che bellissima.

466
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,518
STABLER: Any idea
where Don Juan is now?

467
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:18,149
Sure, he's up
at St. Catherine's.

468

Let me guess,
he's an altar boy, too.

No, not the church,

Hey, he probably
wore himself out

Is that what
you told Dr. Esterman?

Nosy bitch.

479
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,748
Why does she care who I bang?

Maybe she's jealous,
she wants a piece of me, too.

if they knew you had AIDS.

Dr. Esterman knew, right?

not only makes impressions,
it traps dirt.

574
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:21,226
So what?
You walk anywhere
in the park,

575
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:22,998
your shoes are gonna
get mucked up.

Look, soil from the area

577
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:29,210
High mica and schist contents,

578

normal for Central Park,
rare anywhere else.

A sample from where
Greta's body was dumped.

Heavy amount of pollen spores.

581
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:39,819
And this, this is soil
from the Sidley scene.

We catch the guy,
we snag his shoes.

585
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:48,955
A match to all three samples
will be conclusive.

586
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:50,862
I can testify to that.

587
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,202
Same perp. End of story.

588
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:57,967
Okay, then explain
why our guy is Iosing passion

589
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,167
when brutality
usually escalates
with serial killers.

590
00:24:00,242 --> 00:24:01,675
Maybe he got interrupted.

591
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:03,974
Or he's gaining
more self-control
with experience.

592
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:05,343
Practice makes perfect.

593
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:07,939
But the post-offense
behavior changed, too.

594
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:09,780
He drags Greta
into the bushes,

595
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:11,752
takes the time
to cover her up with Ieaves.

596
00:24:11,821 --> 00:24:13,948
As angry as he was,
that could show compassion.

597
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:15,854
But he Ieft Mona exposed.

598
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:17,517
That's crap.
He was hiding the body.

599
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:18,821
Okay, why didn't he
hide Mona?

600
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:19,918
MUNCH: Maybe he Iikes
the attention,

601
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:21,394
wants to be
on the front page again.

602
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,728
Same guy.
Picks off defenseless,
older women

603
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:24,959
that are usually alone.

604
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:27,025
Or there's a connection
between the two victims.

605
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:28,933
Both regulars in the park
every morning.

606
00:24:29,004 --> 00:24:30,733
Both older women.

607
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:32,535
I don't know,
maybe they knew each other.

608
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:35,008
Mona Iived alone,
she was never married.

609
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:36,567
Retired bookkeeper.

610

Haven't Iocated any
of her friends yet.

611

We gotta talk
to Greta's friends.

612
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:41,675
That appointment book
in her office,

613
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,311
she had a standing Iunch date
with a Bonnie Vernon.

614
00:24:46,188 --> 00:24:47,519
Greta never mentioned
any friends

615
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,887
who were bird-watchers.

616
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,585
She ever say anything
about being followed?

617
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:53,321
No, and it's
definitely something
she would've told me.

618
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:54,657
How Iong
had you known her?

619
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,493
Greta and I
were roommates at Radcliffe.

620
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:58,226
She met Arthur at Harvard.

621
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,825
They eloped
after graduation in '61.

622
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:02,803
They eloped, huh?
Why did they elope?

623
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:04,305
Her family
were against the marriage.

624
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:06,568
Greta came from old money.

625
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:09,076
They didn't think
Arthur could
support her properly.

626
00:25:09,144 --> 00:25:10,475
Well, it Iooks Iike
Arthur proved them wrong.

627
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:11,638
They seem to Iive pretty well.

628
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:13,648
On Greta's inheritance.

629
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:15,115
Arthur practiced
his tennis swing

630
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:16,617
more than he practiced Iaw.

631
00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:18,482
Happy marriage?
Perfect couple.

632
00:25:18,554 --> 00:25:20,181
Affairs?
Oh, never.

633
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:23,783
Arthur's so old-fashioned,
I don't think his eyes
even wander.

634
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,486
How about Greta?

635
00:25:26,395 --> 00:25:29,421
A few months ago,
she asked me to run
a credit report on a man.

636
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:31,762
Greta didn't say why,
but I did wonder.

637
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,165
You thought
Greta had a Iover?

638
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:34,600
It had to be personal.

639
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,868
Greta had city investigators
at her disposal
for her AIDS cases.

640
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:39,965
Do you remember a name?

641
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:42,909
Who could forget it?
Vartan Dadian.

642
00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:46,243
I remember thinking
Greta had an Armenian admirer.

643
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:49,750
Are you implying
my wife was having an affair?

644
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:51,945
BENSON: We're not jumping
to any conclusions.

645
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,579
I can't believe it.

646
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:55,553
Did anything seem different
about Greta recently?

647
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,092
The Iast few months,
she wasn't quite herself.

648
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,856
She seemed preoccupied,
but she said it was from work.

649
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,158
You said
she often worked Iate.

650
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:03,358
Any change in her routines?

651
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:04,627
Sometimes she worked
all night,

652
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,601
didn't come home.

653
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:10,239
Greta said bars and clubs
were a good place

654
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:13,135
to trace contacts.

655
00:26:18,248 --> 00:26:22,446
Mr. Esterman,
does the name Vartan Dadian
mean anything to you?

656
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:26,818
No, but if she had
a boyfriend,
I doubt I'd know his name.

657
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:30,355
I thought we had
a perfect marriage.

658
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:39,262
I subpoenaed
Vartan Dadian's financials.

659
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:42,203
Upper East Side address,
banks at Hudson Trust.

660
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:44,467
Routine transactions,
pension checks go in,

661
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,099
rent and small
expenses go out.

662
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:48,371
There's not much
ready cash.

663
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:50,436
Right. But there's plenty
at another account

664
00:26:50,513 --> 00:26:51,912
at West Side Bank.

665
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:54,076
Opened it up Iast year,

666
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,710
statements go to
a P.O. box.

667
00:26:56,786 --> 00:26:57,878
Those are some
big deposits,

668
00:26:57,954 --> 00:26:59,512
Iooks Iike close to
20 grand a month

669
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,454
for the past year.

670
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:02,684
AII wire transfers.

671
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,852
AII from Greta Esterman's
personal account.

672
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:06,919
Well, she's supporting a man
with very expensive tastes.

673
00:27:06,997 --> 00:27:08,692
Look at all these
debit card transactions.

674
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:11,427
Four star hotels,
top restaurants.

675
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:13,731
Greta's boy toy
had himself a good time
on her money.

676
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:15,065
And she's not
his only girlfriend.

677
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:17,129
Mr. Dadian has a fondness
for expensive escorts.

678
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:20,142
Spent a small fortune
at Gold Coast Models.

679
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:25,772
We don't take walk-ins.

680
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:27,407
You need a referral
from a client.

681
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:28,712
FIN: We got a special pass.

682
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:29,843
(PHONE RINGING)

683
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,355
(IN SEXY VOICE)
Welcome to Gold Coast Models,
Angel speaking. PIease hold.

684
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:35,584
Hey, stop!
You can't go in there.
Sure, we can.

685
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:38,492
Darla, I got two cops
on their way in.

686
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:39,653
Come in, officers.

687
00:27:40,096 --> 00:27:43,065
I have nothing to hide.
It's a Iegitimate business.

688
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:45,124
We provide social escorts
for executives.

689
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:46,532
FIN: Save the rap for vice.

690
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,332
We just want some information.

691
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:50,771
I wish all men
were so easy to satisfy.

692
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,274
Who's satisfying
Vartan Dadian?

693
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:56,810
Miss Kitty, on a daily basis.

694
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,209
FIN: Quite a collection
of Iadies.

695
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:02,546
Which one of these Iovelies
is Miss Kitty?

696
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,382
She's not up there.

697
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:06,581
Kitty retired Iast month.

698
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:08,521
Said Dadian
was gonna buy her a condo

699
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:10,218
and set her up
Iike a queen.

700
00:28:10,293 --> 00:28:11,988
Where's Kitty Iiving
the Iife of Iuxury?

701
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:14,030
Still waiting for payday.

702
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:17,533
I hear she's working the bar
at the Broadway Terrace Hotel.

703
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:20,261
(MUSIC PLAYING)

704
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:22,031
What, is something wrong
with Vartan?

705
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:23,197
That's what
we'd Iike to know.

706
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:24,797
When's the Iast time
you saw him?

707
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:25,898
I'm not sure.

708
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,169
You better remember quick,

709
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:29,837
before we haul your sweet ass
down to the precinct.

710
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:31,813
You want to cuff me?
Drop the act.

711
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:34,577
Answer the question,
when was the Iast time
you saw Vartan?

712
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,778
Two nights ago,
he took me to dinner.

713
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:38,582
Where'd you have dessert?

714
00:28:38,655 --> 00:28:40,486
Upstairs in a hotel suite.

715
00:28:40,557 --> 00:28:41,819
FIN: Spend the night?

716
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:44,359
No, that costs extra,
and he was a Iittle short.

717
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:46,292
I went home,
he stayed and slept.

718
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:48,125
The poor man,
he was all worn out.

719
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:49,927
Yeah, I'm sure
he had nothing Ieft to give.

720
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:51,660
Well, usually
he's Iike the Energizer Bunny,

721
00:28:51,735 --> 00:28:53,862
just keeps going
and going and...

722
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:54,961
We get the picture.

723
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:56,596
Are we done?
I'm expecting someone.

724
00:28:56,673 --> 00:28:58,903
Well, cancel it
'cause you're coming with us.

725
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:00,374
Am I under arrest?

726
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:02,604
Keep touching me,
you will be.

727
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:09,143
Sex crimes?

728
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:11,016
What on Earth
brings you to me?

729
00:29:11,087 --> 00:29:13,317
BENSON: Your name came up
in an investigation.

730
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:15,823
We're interested
in some dates
you had recently.

731
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:17,257
I'm flattered.

732
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:20,262
Most people think
there's no sex after 60,

733
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,822
but I'm not seeing
anyone right now.

734
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,925
How could you
forget Kitty?

735
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:29,127
Now, I know
you've got the wrong guy.

736
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:32,140
I'm really not interested
in pussy cats.

737
00:29:33,476 --> 00:29:36,673
An escort service,
Gold Coast Models?

738
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:40,015
They claim
you're a major client.

739
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,880
I've never heard
of them.

740
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:45,748
Your bank has.

741
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:49,389
My account's
not at West Side.

742
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:53,287
Have you had any problems

743
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:56,196
with credit card fraud
or identity theft?

744
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:59,064
No, but I will call my bank
in the morning.

745
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:02,263
Does the name Greta Esterman
mean anything to you?

746
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:04,135
That poor woman
in the park?

747
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:06,107
I read about her
in the papers.

748
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:08,406
How did my name come up?

749
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:10,776
There seems to have been
a grave misunderstanding.

750
00:30:10,847 --> 00:30:12,371
Thank you.

751
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:15,381
Did you go to Harvard?

752
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,213
Yes, I got my acting start
at the Hasty Pudding.

753
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:21,385
What year did you graduate?

754
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,288
1961.

755
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,049
Hmm.

756
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:27,056
Is that a problem?

757
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:29,223
No.

758
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,632
We always meet
at four-star restaurants.

759
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:34,499
Vartan has very good taste.

760
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:37,165
Never would've guessed.
Where'd you go
two nights ago?

761
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,208
Chez Marco.
I met him there at 9:00.

762
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,572
Do you want to know
what I ate?

763
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:43,009
I'm not touching that one.

764
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,808
What kind of mood
was Vartan in?

765
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:47,849
His usual charming self.

766
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:49,282
He's everything
a girl could want.

767
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:50,751
If the price is right.

768
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,117
Where did you go
after dinner?

769
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:54,782
Like I told you before,
back to the hotel.

770
00:30:54,858 --> 00:30:56,348
If there's nothing else,
I'II be going now.

771
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:58,451
Stay awhile.

772
00:30:58,528 --> 00:30:59,722
John.

773
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,792
A few too many guys
in this game
went to Harvard.

774
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,236
Why don't you show her this
and ask her to pick out
her playmate?

775
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:11,569
Great.
Thought you'd Iike it.

776
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:14,135
Before your
next appointment,

777
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,940
can you tell me
if you recognize
any of these men?

778
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:25,714
Well, sure, that's my Vartan.

779
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,063
The night of his wife's death,

780
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:37,565
the grief-stricken husband
has a date with a prostitute?

781
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,761
No wonder he wasn't worried
about her coming home Iate.

782
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:42,168
He booked another one
for right after
her funeral.

783
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:43,762
This Esterman is a class act.

784
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,000
CRAGEN:
So, either he killed her

785
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:46,507
because she found out
about the money,

786
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:49,409
or so he could Iive
happily ever after
with Miss Kitty.

787
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:52,277
It's both.
Those wire transfers
to Vartan Dadian?

788
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:53,508
Greta was in the bank
Iast week,

789
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,312
asking questions about them.

790
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:56,477
The money's
from Greta's account,

791
00:31:56,552 --> 00:31:58,747
but every transaction
is authorized by Esterman.

792
00:31:58,821 --> 00:31:59,947
CRAGEN: Hard to believe
an AIDS doctor

793
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:01,251
would tolerate
his indiscretions,

794
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:02,791
much Iess pay
for his hookers.

795
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:04,588
MUNCH: Esterman didn't give
her much time
to throw him out.

796
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:05,992
Greta went
to the bank on Friday,

797
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:07,393
and Monday morning,
we found her body.

798
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:08,953
Greta divorces Arthur,
he's broke.

799
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:11,227
She winds up dead.
He inherits everything.

800
00:32:11,301 --> 00:32:13,064
It's still all circumstantial.

801
00:32:13,136 --> 00:32:15,229
Arthur's gonna keep up
this poor, old widower routine

802
00:32:15,305 --> 00:32:17,000
until we find
some hard evidence.

803
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:18,938
His hooker ID'd him,

804
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:21,033
that should be enough
for a search warrant.

805
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:24,477
STABLER: Arthur's been making
some big transfers

806
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:27,539
into the bogus Dadian account
at West Side Bank.

807
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:29,141
That kind of cash
would get him
quite a few dates

808
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:30,845
with Miss Kitty.

809
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,410
This guy had it all
planned out.

810
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:34,353
He gives us his wife's
phone threats.

811
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:35,448
He knew we'd go for it.

812
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:36,549
And then he murders
Mona Sidley

813
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:38,560
to make it Iook Iike
a serial killer
did them both.

814
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:40,823
That is cold.

815
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:42,125
What the hell
is going on here?

816
00:32:42,198 --> 00:32:43,563
Counselor.

817
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,059
Search warrant.

818
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,940
You think I killed Greta?
That's ridiculous.

819
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,101
Size 10.
And very dirty.

820
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:56,543
You should really
take better care
of your stuff, Artie.

821
00:32:56,612 --> 00:32:58,136
This is preposterous.

822
00:32:58,214 --> 00:32:59,374
I Ioved my wife.

823
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:01,440
More than you Iove Miss Kitty?

824
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:03,007
Who?
"Who?"

825
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:04,485
Now, come on,
your Iittle plaything.

826
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:06,351
Broadway terrace,
candles, champagne.

827
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:07,411
I don't know
what you're talking about.

828
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,855
BENSON: Save it, Vartan.

829
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:11,723
Or is that just the name
that you use for the hookers?

830
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:15,360
The rock fragments
embedded in the soles,

831
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:18,832
electron microscope confirms
it's Central Park schist.

832
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:20,027
So he takes walks
in the park.

833
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:22,367
We need
more than that.

834
00:33:23,006 --> 00:33:26,203
Ran the second sample
by a forensic palynologist.

835
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:27,537
Excuse me?

836
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,840
Pollen specialist.
So good with spores,

837
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:31,812
they can tell you
which side of the street
to walk on

838
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:33,508
during allergy season.

839
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,483
Second sample
was Ioaded with pollen.

840
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:37,576
See, my buddy
extracted the signature,

841
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:39,553
typed the dominant
and secondary strains,

842
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:41,283
and several hundred
trace species were found...

843
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:43,951
Skip the science test.
Did it match?

844
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:46,556
Perfectly.

845
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:48,995
Boots were within a few yards
of the body and recently,

846
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:52,466
since pollen signatures change
with the growing cycle.

847
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:53,559
And what about
the Iast sample

848
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:55,661
from the
Sidley homicide?

849
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:57,433
Look for yourself.

850
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:01,603
Homicide scene on the Ieft,
Esterman boots on the right.

851
00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:03,736
I'm no scientist,
but they Iook the same.

852
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:04,973
Exactly.

853
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:08,316
BENSON: Your footprints
match the boots.

854
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:11,046
ARTHUR: Mine?
PIease, Detective.
They're a popular style.

855
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,519
It's obviously a coincidence.

856
00:34:12,588 --> 00:34:13,850
"Coincidence."

857
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:15,288
Well, then it must
also be a coincidence

858
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,156
that the dirt on your boots
matches both murder scenes.

859
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:19,489
Not at all.

860
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:22,258
I went there yesterday
to Iay flowers,
say a prayer for my wife

861
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:23,730
and for poor Miss Sidley.

862
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,496
Not to manufacture
a forensics alibi,
of course.

863
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:28,503
You're wasting time
accusing me.

864
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:29,595
I Ioved my wife.

865
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:32,641
Well, you've got
a pretty sick way
of showing it.

866
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:36,166
Fake names,
secret accounts,
call girls.

867
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:39,576
Once again,
you misjudge me, Detective.

868
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:42,976
I did those things
out of respect for Greta.

869
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:45,111
Respect? Come on.

870
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:50,352
After menopause,
Greta Iost interest
in sex. I didn't.

871
00:34:51,594 --> 00:34:53,152
She only asked
that I be discreet,

872
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:55,220
hence the pseudonym.

873
00:34:55,298 --> 00:34:57,163
So you expect us to believe

874
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,860
that Greta
didn't have a problem

875
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:01,267
with your high-risk
sexual activity?

876
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:04,101
We were married
over 40 years, Detective.

877
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:06,300
Other kinds of fidelity
matter far more.

878
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,935
Well, you know,
if everything
that you're saying is true,

879
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:11,275
why don't you just give us
a DNA sample?

880
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:13,577
My DNA
on my own wife's body
means nothing.

881
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:15,549
I'd expect to see it there.

882
00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:17,552
But not on Mona Sidley.

883
00:35:22,024 --> 00:35:23,514
Found a hair.

884
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:28,190
We can get a court order.

885
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:31,256
You have nothing
connecting me
to Mona Sidley.

886
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:34,697
You killed Mona Sidley
to distract us.

887
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,759
You're bootstrapping.

888
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,272
It's clear the same man
killed both women.

889
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:41,310
Your DNA on Sidley's body,
that'II prove it.

890
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:51,943
JFK and Martin Luther King
were both assassinated

891
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:54,819
by a Ione gunman
with a Iong-range rifle.

892
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,553
Follow your Iine of reasoning,

893
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:59,561
and Lee Harvey Oswald
killed them both.

894
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:03,530
No judge will sign
a blood order.

895
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:11,573
CABOT: He's defending
himself well.

896
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:13,734
We don't have enough
to force a sample
from Esterman.

897
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:16,573
We need probable cause
on Sidley alone,
it can't be cumulative.

898
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:18,079
Well, how about
the phony name?

899
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:20,012
Even if I was just charging
on his wife's death,

900
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:22,448
a judge would preclude
that as unduly prejudicial.

901
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:24,679
Then we arrest him
for identity theft.

902
00:36:24,754 --> 00:36:25,812
Can't.

903
00:36:25,888 --> 00:36:26,946
Esterman paid the bills,

904
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:28,991
so there was no intent
to defraud.

905
00:36:29,058 --> 00:36:31,219
I'II be Iucky if the judge
Iets me use it as an alias.

906
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:33,819
Well, no blood sample,
no case.

907
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:35,955
Maybe Esterman already gave.

908
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:38,626
Fundraiser for the city
blood bank.

909
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:43,464
Your Honor,
if you allow this,

910
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,699
anyone who gives blood

911
00:36:44,774 --> 00:36:46,833
could have their
rights trampled on.

912
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:49,844
The blood was obtained
from its Iawful owner,
the blood bank,

913
00:36:49,912 --> 00:36:51,812
which chose not
to contest our subpoena.

914
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:53,746
Mr. Esterman
has no standing here.

915
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:55,477
What about my fundamental
right to privacy?

916
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:57,781
That expectation expired
when you donated the blood,

917
00:36:57,853 --> 00:36:59,548
knowing full well
it would be tested.

918
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:01,954
For diseases, not DNA.

919
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:05,216
I respect your right
to privacy is paramount,

920
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:08,229
but your own actions
do diminish that argument.

921
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:10,265
She's using my
philanthropic activities

922
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,530
to justify an end-run
around the judicial system.

923
00:37:13,603 --> 00:37:14,695
She knew full well

924
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,362
she didn't have grounds
for a blood order.

925
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:18,532
I couldn't compel a sample
from Mr. Esterman,

926
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:20,838
but there is no Iegal basis
to bar us from testing

927
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,071
what he gave away freely.

928
00:37:23,145 --> 00:37:25,340
Agreed.
But I'm Iimiting the scope.

929
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:26,506
Your Honor,
the sample in question...

930
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:27,981
I'm sorry, Miss Cabot,

931
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,677
but I'm only
allowing you to test

932
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:31,913
for the same battery
of drugs and diseases

933
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:34,684
that the blood bank would.
No DNA.

934
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:43,656
Esterman's blood type's AB,
and he's free of any diseases.

935
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:44,757
STABLER: So we're screwed.

936
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,358
You're not,
but your suspect is,

937
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:47,925
I'd say on a regular basis.

938
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,494
You know this
from the blood?

939
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:51,267
WARNER: Tox screen
came back positive

940
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,774
for high Ievels
of Viagra and ecstasy.

941
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:57,178
Viagra, I understand
but ecstasy?

942
00:37:57,246 --> 00:37:59,806
What's a guy Esterman's age
doing using a club drug?

943
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:02,350
To enhance
his sexual encounters.

944
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:04,249
Viagra gives you potency.

945
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,221
Ecstasy heightens sensation
and Iowers inhibitions.

946
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,518
And in the quantity
he took them,

947
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:10,786
your guy would've had
a two-week hard-on.

948
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,158
He was in his own
private rave.

949
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:15,863
The ecstasy
is all we got.

950
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,262
Anything short
of a smoking gun,

951
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,494
Esterman walks
on both homicides.

952
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:21,536
So what? We collar him
'cause he Iikes to party.

953
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:24,402
Well, it's amazing
what drug dealers

954
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:25,770
know about their clients.

955
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:27,775
A guy using
this much ecstasy

956
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:29,310
gotta have
a steady supplier.

957
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:30,811
So we dump his phones.

958
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,938
Fin can reach out
to narcotics,

959
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:34,778
see if any
of the numbers ring a bell.

960
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,713
You Fin?

961
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:39,220
You the man
with the vitamin E?

962
00:38:39,288 --> 00:38:40,346
For the right price.
Yeah.

963
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:41,947
It's all there.

964
00:38:42,024 --> 00:38:44,390
AII right, Iisten,
trail-mix all at once,

965
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,518
you're gonna need two women.

966
00:38:45,594 --> 00:38:48,290
That's what my man
Vartan told me.

967
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:50,059
Hey, man, no names.

968
00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:52,293
I gotta jet.
Stick around.

969
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:55,003
Now, you tell us
about Vartan,

970
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,369
we're gonna Iet
this one slide.

971
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,668
Or we can take you with us,
dealer's choice.

972
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:02,040
He's a steady customer.

973
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:04,045
How's he know you?

974
00:39:04,113 --> 00:39:05,705
Dropped some off
for this chick, Kitty.

975
00:39:05,781 --> 00:39:07,271
Vartan was partying with her,

976
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,443
Iiked to ride the E-train,
so we set up his own account.

977
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:10,644
Where?

978
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,211
He's got a Iove shack on 92nd Street.

979
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,916
Just dropped some off
a few hours ago.

980
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:19,561
You have no right!

981
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:20,686
Search warrant!

982
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:23,861
Which you violated
when you burst in
without knocking.

983
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:26,128
Exigent circumstances.
We heard a woman moaning.

984
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:27,191
Are you all right?

985
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:28,702
I was until you
interrupted me.

986
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:30,602
You get dressed.
You, too, Counselor.

987
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:32,470
Your next date's
with a judge.

988
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,940
He didn't do anything.

989
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:36,034
You get hazardous duty pay
for sleeping with a killer?

990
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,374
What are you
talking about?

991
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:38,504
Don't say
another word, darling.

992
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:41,015
Didn't Arthur tell you
he murdered his wife
and another woman?

993
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,072
Don't Iisten to them.

994
00:39:42,151 --> 00:39:44,551
He would never kill anyone.

995
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,054
He taking you to Brazil?
Brazil?

996
00:39:47,423 --> 00:39:50,085
Airline ticket,
one way, first class.

997
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,593
I don't see one
in here for you, Kitty.

998
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:54,060
Yours hasn't come yet.

999
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,657
It better come quick
since the ticket's
for tomorrow.

1000
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:01,163
I had to.
They were harassing me.

1001
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:03,595
You know I Iove you.

1002
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:04,934
(SCOFFS)

1003
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:08,101
You were going by yourself.

1004
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:12,504
Kitty, did you use
a condom tonight?

1005
00:40:14,383 --> 00:40:17,011
No, I trusted the bastard.

1006
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:27,118
You have no right to hold me
when I'm not under arrest.

1007
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:33,667
Kitty gave us the DNA sample
you deposited.

1008
00:40:40,876 --> 00:40:42,434
You'II find it's a match
to the DNA

1009
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:44,809
I Ieft on poor Mona Sidley.

1010
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,316
So, now you feel
sorry for her.

1011
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:51,410
I'm sorry she had to die.

1012
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:54,853
Is that a confession?

1013
00:40:57,827 --> 00:41:01,263
Do you know what it's Iike
to grow old, Detective?

1014
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,991
Greta and I were married
for 40 years

1015
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:05,260
when she
Iost interest in sex.

1016
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:07,564
So you turned to prostitutes.

1017
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:10,365
That's how
I found Kitty.

1018
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,133
When I couldn't
keep up with her,

1019
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:14,938
she gave me Viagra
and ecstasy.

1020
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,478
Made me feel
Iike I was 18 again.

1021
00:41:17,546 --> 00:41:18,911
I was hooked.

1022
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,542
How did Greta find out?

1023
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:26,076
From the bank.
She confronted me.

1024
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:28,453
I told her everything.

1025
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:32,085
Begged her to try the ecstasy,
rekindle our passion.

1026
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:36,191
She Iooked at me Iike I was

1027
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:39,999
an animal.

1028
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:41,967
You had high-risk sex,

1029
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:44,198
just Iike the people
that she had to trace.

1030
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:46,207
I'm not Iike them.
I'm not infected.

1031
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:49,506
She wanted to divorce you,
take away her money.

1032
00:41:49,578 --> 00:41:51,603
That's why you killed her.

1033
00:41:54,483 --> 00:41:55,609
A beautiful woman
Iike you

1034
00:41:55,684 --> 00:41:58,710
wouldn't give me
a second Iook
if I wasn't rich.

1035
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,287
What are you
gonna do when your wife
turns you away?

1036
00:42:07,363 --> 00:42:09,490
You'd do exactly what I did.

1037
00:42:13,002 --> 00:42:14,902
You murdered
a complete stranger.

1038
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:18,428
You mutilated your wife.
Nothing justifies that.

1039
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:25,572
I was alive again
for the first time in years.

1040
00:42:28,317 --> 00:42:30,581
Greta tried to take it away.

1041
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,319
I had to stop her.
