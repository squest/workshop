NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:05,833
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:10,077
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,602
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,911
These are their stories.

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,174
What'd she say?

8
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,777
Moms won't budge.

9
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,618
Your arraignment's tomorrow,

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,750
so if you can post bond
you'II only be in
the Tombs for the night.

11
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,316
What do you think
they'II ask for?

12
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:28,919
Probably more than you got.

13
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,621
What if I can't
make bail?

14
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,563
Then you go to
Rikers till your trial.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,299
Look, just Iet me talk
to Mrs. Parks. I'II try
to make her understand.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,860
It's not gonna help.
She's on fire.

17
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,769
She wants you to pay
for what you did
to her daughter.

18
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:43,503
I Iove Sara.
Look, she's pregnant,
and I want to marry her.

19
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,546
She was 15 when
you took her to bed.
You're 21.

20
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,981
In case you haven't heard,
there's Iaws against that.

21
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,780
So there's nothing
I can do.

22
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,583
Serve your time.
If you're Iucky,
you'II be out in 18 months.

23

your stay here
is short,

Iike a Iifetime
if you make trouble.

25

I will not Iisten to
pleas of innocence,
police brutality, entrapment

26
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,133
or evidence tampering.
Save it for Legal Aid.

27
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,197
You'II be fingerprinted,

30
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,278

Have a nice day.

31
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,424
Spread them.

32

35
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,544
There's a free bunk
right over there.

36
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,382
You have a problem?

37
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,020
On your feet, mark.

38
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,117
I said move it!

BIock H.

46
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:21,928
The M.E. is with the body,

47
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,698
and one of your detectives
is interrogating
the cell mates.

48
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,034
How many prisoners
did you move?

49
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,370
Ten. We only cleared
the flanking cells.

50
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,774
Okay, I need their
names and their sheets.
Yes, ma'am.

(INMATES SHOUTING)

It's starting
to get to me.

00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:51,792
The dead bodies?

55
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,662
The animals
rattling their cages.

56
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,100
Where's your partner?
He's at a VICAP seminar,

57
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,468
making nice
with the Feds.

58
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,972
What's his story?

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,974
Sodomized with
a foreign object.

60
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,838
BIed out internally.
Probably
perforated his colon.

61
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,608
Oh! Victim's name
is Carlos Torres.

62
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,811
Tomb intake record
shows he's only been
here eight hours.

63
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,943
One visit to the infirmary.

64
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,453
Liver temp is 96,

65
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:18,787
so that means he's
only been dead four,
maybe five hours, tops.

66
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:22,462
Just you and Torres
in the cell, and
you didn't speak to him?

67
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,190
I said, "Hi."

68
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,062
I won't repeat
what he said to me.

69

He's Dominican.
They're animals.

72
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,267
You got a temper yourself,
Ortega.

73
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,605
Three domestic
disturbance calls
in the Iast two weeks,

74
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:40,010
and the Iast one,
you knifed your Iover.

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,412
He hit me first.

76

How's he Iook?

77
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,283
Ortega claims Torres
wanted nothing to do
with him 'cause he was gay.

78
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,759
Given the jailhouse routine,
not many people had access.

79
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,455
There are ways around
the system if you got

80
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,191
a fever to rack up
Dominican bodies.

81
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,164
You thinking this is
Mexicans against Dominicans?

82
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,702
It's easier to get
got on the inside.
Nowhere to run.

83
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,205
Mexicans transport the drugs,
Dominicans distribute.

84
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,672
Everybody just
wants a bigger piece.

85
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,767
Which is why we computerized
our tracking system
to keep them apart.

86
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,004
But it doesn't
always work.

87
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,376
No system is foolproof.

for court transfer?

89

Three, but they're all
in different cellblocks.

90
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,977
Any chance they had
access to our victim?

91
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,682
I don't see how,
since inmate movements
are restricted.

92
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,621
Torres didn't move
from his cell at all.

93
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,159
BENSON: He went to
the infirmary.

94
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,889
Right, after the processing.
Then he was assigned a cell
and Iocked down.

95
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,864
Hold on.
I spoke too soon.

96
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,892
Hector Ramirez
went to the infirmary
complaining about a bad tooth.

97
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,269
FIN: Was he escorted
to the nurse
while Torres was there?

98
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,372
Their visits overlapped.
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,809
Okay,
what's Ramirez in for?

100
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,345
Murder. What else?

101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,573
I'II have a guard
bring him to a holding cell.

102
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,675
What's up, bacon?

103

BENSON: Carlos Torres.

104
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,617
Yeah, I heard he bought it.

105
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,553
Should be stiff
by now, right?

106
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,390
You think it's funny?

107
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,950
Yeah, puerca. Laugh a minute.

108
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,662
Well, how's this
for a punch Iine?

109
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,891
You don't cooperate
with us and I will make
it my business

110
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,695
to have the guards
house you in cellblock B.

111
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,395
One cage is as
good as the next.

112
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,199
B-block is Dominican deep.

113
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,396
I don't think they'd Iike
what you did to their brother.

114
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:14,463
Wasn't me.

115
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,977
Hector, I think
you forced your way
into the infirmary.

116
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,173
I don't think
there's anything wrong
with your tooth.

117
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,149
These your teeth or mine?
I was hurting.

118
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,847
FIN: We talk to the nurse,
what's she gonna say?

119
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,388
You give me too
much credit, man.

120
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,651
I didn't know the mark
was even gonna be
in the infirmary.

121
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,558
Opportunity knocked.
Torres is Dominican,
you're Mexican.

122
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,959
This is an easy close.

123
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,527
Yeah, if you make it up.

124
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,759
We didn't have to.
We checked your
prison records.

125
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,165
Seems you get off
forcing your fellow
inmates to bend over.

126
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,430
What'd you rape
him with, Hector?

127
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,764
Something real
handy in the infirmary,

128
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,738
Iike a mop or a broom?

129
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,105
I only went up there to
get next to the nurse.

130
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,409
Got a Iong bid this time.

131
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,915
I won't be seeing
Iadies for a while.

132
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,681
What makes you think
that the nurse
would even talk to you?

133
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,618
If she had been by herself,

134
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,658
I would have made her
do more than just talk.

135
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,619
I knew he was
Iying right away.

136
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,426
He had no abscesses,
no redness or swelling.

137
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,933
Was Hector Ramirez
ever Ieft alone
with the victim?

138
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,130
No. He spent
the entire time
harassing me.

139
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,867
What was wrong
with Torres?

140
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,966
I had no idea he
had a serious injury.

141
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,136
And when he came
in for vomiting,
I checked his vitals.

142
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,339
He had a slight fever.
I thought he had a flu,

143
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,245
so I gave him
some Pepto. He said
he felt better.

144
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,544
Who escorted him?

145
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,175
An intake guard,
Nathan Duarte.

146
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,652
And he seemed
pretty steamed, too.
Not that I blame him.

147
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,086
What was he mad about?

148
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:39,057
Uh, Torres was calling
him some ugly names. Uh...

149
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,118
Homo, faggot, pillow.
You get the gist.

150
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,762
Guards got to be
thick-skinned.

151
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,364
Except for Nathan.

152
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,560
Another guard
just outed him
not too Iong ago.

153
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,535
How Iong was Torres here?

154
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,970
Nathan took him to the shower
right after I gave
him the medicine,

155
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,940
and I could hear
Torres screaming
down the hallway.

156
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,239
He did not want
Nathan to touch him.

157
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,143
I'm already Iate to post,
so what gives?

158
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,478
I heard you had beef
with Carlos Torres.
He was hard to deal with.

159
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,042
No more than any other hump
coming through.

160
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,179
I heard it got
a Iittle personal
between you two.

161
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,847
Not at all, Detective.

162
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,791
I've been called a Iot worse
by some of my Iesser
evolved co-workers.

163
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,829
Still must have
bugged you.

164
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,921
This isn't exactly
a nurturing environment.

165
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,296
I Iearned a Iong time ago
not to take it personally.

166
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,768
You escorted Torres
to the showers
straight from the infirmary?

167
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,368
Yeah.
He puked all over himself
after he Ieft the nurse.

168
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:32,845
Was anyone else
in the shower
when you got there?

169
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,881
No. Why?

170
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,542
Anybody come in
while you were there?

171
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,078
I don't believe this.

172
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,349
I'm a suspect
because I'm gay.

173
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,051
No, it's because you
were the Iast person
who had access to the victim.

174
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,491
And since I'm
the sodomy expert,

175
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,027
I did this to teach
the homophobe a Iesson.

176
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,893
Is that your theory?

177
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,361
I didn't touch
the Iittle creep.

178
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:58,131
He took a shower, he got
dressed, I took him to his
assigned cell. That's it.

179
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,331
What time
did you sign out?

180
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,464
A Iittle
after midnight,

181
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,530
and I went
straight home.

182
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,702
Can anyone vouch
that you didn't
come back here?

183
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,373
His name is Chris Hartford.
He's a Legal Aid attorney.

MRS. HARTFORD: Who is it?

186
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,313
BENSON: It's the police.

187
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,620
Let's see that again.

188

(BABY CRYING)

189
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,226

Manhattan SVU.

What's this about?

191
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,423
We're Iooking
for Chris Hartford.

192
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,264
Why are you Iooking
for my husband,
Detective?

193
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:32,931
FIN: Is he here?
Chris? Police.

194
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,098
How can I help you?

195
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,005
Why don't we take this
out of the hallway?
Come inside.

196
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,239
It'd probably be best
if we could speak with you
privately, Mr. Hartford.

197
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,405
What about?

198
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,311
Nathan Duarte.

199
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,344
Chris?

200
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,545
I'II just be a minute.
It's client privilege.

201
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,611
It's all right.

202
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:53,885
What kind of
trouble is he in?

203
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,192
We just need
to verify his
whereabouts Iast night.

204
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,831
Uh, you have to understand,
this doesn't happen
all the time.

205
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,769
We get together when
my wife's out of town.
It's not what you think.

206
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:09,298
Okay, we're not Iooking
for an explanation,
just a time frame.

207
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,277
I was with him from
about 1:00 a.m. to 6:00.

208
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,675
Okay. You can go
back to your family.
Thank you.

209
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:23,715
BENSON: You almost done
with the autopsy?

210
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,757
Not yet. But I can
give you cause of death.

211
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,290
I recovered
wooden splinters
from his rectum.

212
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,263
The foreign object
was introduced
with such force

213
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,299
that it put
a hole in his colon.

214
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,494
How much time
would it have taken
to bleed out?

215
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,797
Hours.

216
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,566
BIood clot at the site
held for a while,
until it blew.

217
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,131
So you're saying the attack
didn't happen at the Tombs.

218
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,540
Doesn't seem Iikely.

219
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,477
The nurse and the guard
said he was sick
at the intake desk.

220
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,070
I found evidence
of peritonitis.

221
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,414
An infection Iike that
will cause nausea, vomiting
and a temperature spike.

222
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,387
Liver temp was 96,
TOD was four hours earlier,

223
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,753
so he had
a 101 degree fever.

224
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,951
So he arrived at the Tombs
before midnight

225
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,220
and was dead by 4:00 a.m.,
5:00 at the Iatest.

226
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,890
He was bleeding internally
before he got transferred.

227
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,060
A cop must've sodomized him
inside the precinct.

228
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,642
CRAGEN: Are we sure our
perp is a cop?

229
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,508
I mean, maybe
his injuries occurred
prior to his arrest.

230
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:23,345
Well, the 61 says
that Carlos Torres
was arrested at 8:00 p.m.

231
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,442
He didn't arrive
at the Tombs
until around midnight.

232
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,679
He was sick
when he got there.

233
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,220
He went to the nurse,
the showers,

234
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,721
then to bed and
never woke up.

235
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,348
Where was he processed?
29.

236
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:34,019
Who were
the arresting officers?

237
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,221
Les Cooper
and Randall Grant.

238
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,456
I'II have their
jackets pulled.

239
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,999
John Royce is
the commanding officer.
See him first.

240
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,900
I'II tell him
you're on your way.
Great.

241
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,232
Log book for the day shows
the collar was routine.

242
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,368
Torres was cuffed at 8:00
and transported around 1 1:30.

243
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,276
FIN: Three and a half hours
your average booking time?

244
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,540
It depends on the arrest.

245
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,741
This was pretty
straightforward, though,
even though he resisted

246
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,909
and assaulted
one of my men.

247
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,679
Who was that?
Luke Edmunds.

248
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,846
He was put out on medical
right after the brawl.

249
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,150
He'II be out
the rest of the week.

250
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,485
Was it serious?

251
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,989
Took a blow
to the head.

252
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,323
What can you tell us
about the arresting officers?

253
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,522
They're pretty
straight-up cops.

254
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:14,590
Grant's a rookie,
so the jury's still out.
Cooper gets the job done.

255
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,192
Not always
the way you Iike it.

256
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,894
Coop's a Iittle
free with his hands.

257
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,030
This precinct's
right in the center
of drug turf.

258
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,871
Sometimes you got to
flex on the players
to get their attention.

259
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,240
Not in my precinct.

260
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,405
BENSON: Where are Cooper
and Grant now?

261
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,506
Sector car Charlie.

262
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,576
I'd Iike to avoid
taking them out of rotation
while I'm shorthanded.

263
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,651
Officer Grant,
how you doing?

264
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,417
Detective Benson,
Tutuola.

265
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,252
Can we talk to you
guys for a minute?

266
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,554
Sure, what can we
do for you?

267
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,720
What can you tell us
about Carlos Torres?

268
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:43,785
(COOPER CHUCKLES)

269
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,558
Shocking when
a drug dealing gangbanger
shows up dead, huh?

270
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,863
You had run-ins
with him before?
Sure.

271
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,335
We arrested him
three, four times
in the Iast month.

272
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,428
Guy was made of Teflon.

273
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,937
Must be pretty frustrating.

274
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,105
One time a judge
threw out the crack
we pinched him with

275
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,077
because we found
it in his mouth.

276
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,203
Said it was
an illegal search.

277
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,373
So you tell me,
would you be frustrated?

278
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,144
Yeah, but not enough
to take him out.

279
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,583
And just so we're clear,
the arrest went by the book.

280
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,314
What happened that night?

281
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,515
There was a street brawl
outside the CIub Rendezvous.

282
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,057
It's a trouble spot.

283
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,526
Four sector cars showed up
to disperse the crowd.

284
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,926
Torres got caught
in the mix.

285
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,295
But once he took a swing
at Officer Edmunds
that was it.

286
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,560
Threw him in the back
of the blue and white,

287
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,602
put the bracelets on him,
headed to the house.

288
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,863
You guys make any stops?

289
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,565
Well, we didn't have time
to tune him up, if that's
what you're thinking.

290
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,904
No, our call came in at 7:00,
booking started at 8:00.

291
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,340

control the scene.

It's a real problem,

ever mix it up in here?

The club's a safe haven.

297
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,289
As far as I heard,
there's no such thing

298
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,757
between Mexicans
and Dominicans.

299
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,224
That's where
you're wrong,

Even a gangster
needs a safe place

Yeah, he was here
that night
with his girl.

303

00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,093
Yeah, they was celebrating
'cause she was pregnant.

305
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,901
I remember,
'cause she asked for milk,
but I don't serve it.

306
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,635
Okay. You see him
go outside?

307
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,975
Not until the uniforms
came up in here
and got him.

308
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,480
When was that?

309
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,176
Right before
the street fight started.

310
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,519
BENSON: Cooper and Grant
had reason to hurt him.

311
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,387
They'd arrested
him four times,

312
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,618
and he kept skating
on the charges.

313
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,921
So why not
just whip his ass

314
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,326
instead of tapping it?
'Cause I think that
the tune-up went too far.

315
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,886
I think Cooper and
Grant took a nasty turn,

316
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,455
now they have to
cover for each other.

317
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,897
CRAGEN: What does
the evidence support?

318
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,598
Well, Cooper and Grant
didn't have time to do
the deed pre-arrest.

319
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,665
Edmunds came in
to back them up.
After Torres slugged him,

320
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,973
Cooper and Grant
cuffed him and put him
in the sector car.

321
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,536
Corroborated?
By the other cops
on the scene.

322
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,049
Central was notified
that Torres was in custody.

323
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,382
Ten-minute ride
back to the house,
and the Iog book confirms it.

324
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,955
That's why
it had to happen
inside the precinct.

325
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,888
And how did
they pull it off
without witnesses?

326
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,425
We've all done
our time in uniform.

327
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,927
Cop gets hurt by a perp,
you get a free shot.

328
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,364
Duty Iog has Officer
Luke Edmunds reported

329
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,027
to the hospital 8:00 p.m.,
blow to the head.

330
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,162
So the question is,
did Edmunds go home

331
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,435
or back to the precinct
to teach Torres a Iesson?

332
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,733
I'II sit him down.

333
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,143
Fin, I want you with
CSU to comb the 29.

334
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,114
Anything you find,
walk through the Iab.

335
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,616
That's a pretty big precinct.
You want to narrow it down?

336
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,245
Well, to do
that kind of damage
takes privacy.

337
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,481
Let's start with
the sector car,

338
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,456
interrogation rooms
and bathrooms.

339
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,257
You know,
Carlos Torres is dead.

340
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,856
If you're trying
to pinch me for it,
don't I need my PBA rep?

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,230
Actually,
I just need your account
of what happened that night.

342
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,998
It's in the 61,
Detective.

343
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,299
Is it?
Don't play games with me.

344
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,737
I do this for a Iiving,
the same as you.

345
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,298
Then why are you
giving me
a hard time?

346
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,270
Look, I'm still in pain.
I didn't mean to snap.

347
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,281
I know you got a job to do,
you got to clear your case,

348
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,782
even though the hump
had it coming.

349
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,614
And Torres deserved it
because his charges
always got dropped

350
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,984
or because
he hit you?

351
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,455
This kind of high-stakes game,
your number comes up
eventually.

352
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,186
Doesn't matter if
it's us or the streets.
Game over.

353
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,989
AII right. So what
do you think happened?

354
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:04,259
Some cellmate in
the Tombs cornholed him.

355
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:07,233
Well, how do you know
that's how he died? We haven't
released that information.

356
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,734
Cops talk.

357
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:11,328
Well, then
they didn't tell you
the whole story.

358
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,999
You see, the evidence shows
that he was attacked here,
not in the Tombs.

359
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:15,167
So how do you
explain that?

360
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,403
I can't. I got hurt
and went to the hospital.

361
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:23,015
But the hospital
released you at 8:45.
Where'd you go after that?

362
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,745
Home.
Home. Really?

363
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:26,514
'Cause the desk sergeant
said that you came back here

364
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:27,645
to get something
out of your Iocker.

365
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:29,587
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Yeah, then I went home.

366
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:36,855
So,

367
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,362
can I go?

368
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,102
I think you're gonna
need that PBA rep now.

369
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:50,039
FIN: The trail of blood
Ieads out of the stall.

370
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:52,739
They sodomized Torres
with whatever was handy.

371
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:54,144
Over here.

372
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,516
(SIGHS)

373
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:09,586
Looks Iike we just found
our murder weapon.

374
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:12,860
Till we type it,
blood could've
come from anybody.

375
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:15,529
Came here
straight from One P.P.

376
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,364
I'm surprised
you can still sit.

377
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:20,236
Officer Edmunds
gave his confession,
wants to make a deal.

378
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,140
Public won't go for it.
They'II want that
cop's head on a stake.

379
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:25,835
That's why the brass
wants it kept quick
and quiet.

380
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,574
But what about
his accomplices?

381
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:32,046
Torres and Edmunds
weren't alone in
that bathroom. He had help.

382
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,349
That's not the way he
tells it, Detective.

383
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:36,549
He understands he cooperates,
he gets Ieniency.

384
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:37,613
He doesn't deserve it.

385
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,659
We make deals with
perps all the time.

386
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,524
Cops should be held
to a higher standard.

387
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:45,656
The Chief called the play.
The D.A.'s been notified.
It's done.

388
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:53,471
CABOT: Murder two, Counselor.

389
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,600
We've got your client cold
for depraved indifference.

390
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,804
That's 25-to-Iife.
And cops don't do
too well in prison.

391
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:02,246
Depraved indifference
for a dead gangbanger?
It's Iaughable.

392
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,614
The victim isn't Iaughing.
In fact, he's dead.

393
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:06,880
Oh, don't be naive.

394
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:10,117
His miserable Iife
would be fodder
for the jury.

395
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:13,285
But no one wants that, right?

396
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,659
So Iet's be reasonable.
Man two, eight-to-10.

397
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,528
Murder two, 1 2-to-25.
One-time offer.

398
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,030
I don't call that reasonable.

399
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:26,835
Your client sodomized
someone so violently
that he bled to death.

400
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:31,071
There is no way I'm going to
offer anything Iess
than double digits.

401
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:32,838
Okay.

402
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,508
(WHISPERING)

403
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:44,852
Man two, 10-to-20.

404
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,051
Fine.

405
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:51,321
I don't Iike it.

406
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,332
Do I Iook Iike
I'm having fun?

407
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,369
Your boss and my boss
just want to make this
go away.

408
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,098
'Cause they want it
business as usual.

409
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:00,834
But there is no way
that Edmunds acted alone.

410
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:02,500
No proof he didn't.

411
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,602
Our victim was a gangster
and a homophobe.

412
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,240
What Edmunds did
to him is tantamount
to his worst nightmare.

413
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,546
He would've
kicked Iike a mule
to make it stop.

414
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,984
You're thinking
Torres was held down.

415
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:14,350
He had to be.

416
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,288
And whoever
helped Edmunds do it
is gonna walk.

417
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:21,658
Not if you find me evidence.
Then the deal is void.

418
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,162
Let me know.

419
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:30,103
I got my orders.
Officially,
the case is closed.

420
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:33,436
Unofficially?
Work fast and
stay under the radar.

421
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,509
Good timing.
I just finished.

422
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:44,346
BENSON: PIease tell me
you have evidence supporting
more than one perp.

423
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,010
There had to be at Ieast two.

424
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:49,613
Victim's got deep tissue
bruising on both his hands
and knees consistent

425
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,318
with the mosaic tile
in the precinct bathroom.

426
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:53,917
So he was on all fours.

427
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,428
Figures he had to be
so Edmunds could have access.

428
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:58,156
WARNER: He's also got
a Iong cylindrical bruise

429
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,926
across the back
of his shoulders,

430
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,399
indicating he was
held down by force.

431
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,833
BENSON: Nightstick to
the neck?

432
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:05,235
That would get the job done.

433
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:07,866
But Edmunds still
could've worked alone.

434
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:08,964
Torres was cuffed.

435
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:12,012
Hey, he wasn't shackled.
So why didn't he fight back?

436
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,242
The bruise is deep.
So someone else
had to apply pressure

437
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,043
by using all their weight.

438
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:20,712
We dump his phones.
We'II find out who
he's covering for.

439
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:23,950
Look at this.
Here's another one.

440
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:28,085
That makes 55 calls
between Edmunds and Cooper
in the Iast three days.

441
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,652
They're trying to get
their stories straight.

442
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,164
Phone calls don't put Cooper
in that bathroom with Edmunds.

443
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,996
Forensics is not
gonna help us, either.

444
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:35,729
Any trace evidence
found on Torres

445
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,998
can be explained
by physical contact
during the arrest.

446
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:41,166
Well, if Cooper and
Edmunds were together,
other cops had to see them.

447
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,575
And if One P.P. finds
out we're still digging,
they'II shut us down.

448
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,772
So stay out of the 29.

449
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,110
Focus on Edmunds.
Dig in his Iife.

450
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,946
You'II find
a connecting thread
to Cooper.

451
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,251
Lots of calls went to
a residence, uh, registered
to Stephanie Grayson.

452
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,685
Girlfriend?

453
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:01,694
As much as he's paying in
cell phone bills,
she better be.

454
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,389
CRAGEN: Well, Iet's find out
how close they are.

455
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:07,400
There's no marital privilege,
so the pillow talk
is admissible.

456
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:14,105
I know Luke's been arrested,
but no one will
tell me what for.

457
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,335
How Iong have you known
Officer Edmunds?

458
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,176
I met him at the hospital
when his brother OD'd.
I'm a nurse.

459
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:21,475
He took it really hard.

460
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,210
Parents were dead,
he practically
raised the kid himself.

461
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:25,843
How often
did you see him?

462
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,580
Whenever he wasn't working
or on his breaks.

463
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:29,054
Did you meet any
of his buddies?

464
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:30,622
A few. Why?

465
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:33,285
Well, he might be taking
the heat for some of them.

466
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,021
Is that possible?

467
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:39,927
You know, maybe
we should take this
down to the precinct

468
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,833
and get a more
formal statement
from you.

469
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,799
This is about that
drug dealer, isn't it?

470
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:47,340
Edmund's came up
against quite a few,

471
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:52,038
so you're going to have to be
more specific with me
if you want to help him.

472
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,570
AII I know is his
name was Vasquez.
Luke was hot for the guy.

473
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,014
Said he was
moving too much weight

474
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,551
and was slipping
through the system.

475
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,016
And he hated drug dealers.

476
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:02,453
With a passion.

477
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:05,083
He said Vasquez
was too slick
to get pinched,

478
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,855
so he tailed him to
catch him in the act.

479
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:08,952
So what happened?

480
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:13,489
Luke busted him with a gram,
and then Vasquez
pulled out a knife.

481
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,730
The only thing Luke could do
was shoot him.

482
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:20,604
He was really messed up
about it for a while.

483
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,369
Till I gave him
a different perspective.

484
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:24,468
What was
your take on it?

485
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:29,945
He's a bad guy,
a drug dealer,
for God's sake.

486
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,850
Luke was saving
someone else's
kid brother.

487
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:36,955
Okay, got it. Thanks.

488
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,219
Turns out
the girlfriend
wasn't making it up.

489
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:42,323
A drug dealer
named Javier Vasquez
expired two months ago.

490
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,590
Only he wasn't shot,
his throat was slashed.

491
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:46,064
It hardly plays
Iike self-defense.

492
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,633
Where was
the body found?

493
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,726
Dead in the center
of the 29 territory.

494
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:52,897
Homicide detective
mentioned a cylindrical
bruise across his throat

495
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:54,031
but not across his back.

496
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:55,370
Sounds Iike
a chokehold to me.

497
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,774
Yeah,
but two dead drug dealers
still doesn't put anyone else

498
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:01,008
in that bathroom
with Edmunds.
I know, but pattern will.

499
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:02,275
Look, Iet's see
if we can connect

500
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,146
any other dealers to
Edmunds and Cooper.

501
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:05,583
A jury'II buy
they work together.

502
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:06,641
Okay, I'II check with Warner

503
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,415
and have her pull
any matching morgue files.

504
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,856
Okay, you know what?
I'II meet you
back at the squad.

505
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,160
What can I do for
you today, Detective?

506
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,930
I'd Iike to have another Iook
at that duty roster.

507
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:26,404
What for?
Investigation's closed.
Edmunds is in custody.

508
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:28,703
Actually,
I'm working on another case.

509
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:29,868
What's that?

510
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,433
I'm not at Iiberty
to discuss it.

511
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,277
I'd just Iike to
see the Iog book
from two months ago.

512
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:37,283
Get authorization,
come back.
I'II be here all day.

513
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:39,785
Get it straight, Sergeant.
I don't work for you.

514
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,150
I got a Iead on
an open homicide,

515
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:42,449
and I'd Iike to
check my facts

516
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:44,423
before I pass it along.

517
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:52,025
What are you Iooking for?

518
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,329
When a drug dealer
named Vasquez
was killed two months ago,

519
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,460
which sector car responded?

520
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,334
Two months ago?

521
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:00,066
Yeah, the 27th.

522
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:03,603
(CLEARS THROAT)

523
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:07,345
Edmunds and Cooper
were partnered that day.

524
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:10,908
How often did
they ride together?

525
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:15,921
AII the time, until Cooper
made field training officer
Iast month.

526
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,354
Thank you.

527
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:23,890
Officer Cooper!

528
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,397
Sweet ride.

529
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:28,361
What do you want, Detective?

530
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:29,696
Is that a 'vette
in your garage?

531
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,601
You must be working
a hell of a Iot of overtime.

532
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:34,732
Give it a rest, huh?
IAB wants to dig, fine.

533
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,606
I wanted to talk to you
about Luke Edmunds.

534
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,176
There's nothing to say.

535
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,376
He's guilty.
I heard he pled out.

536
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:47,079
I just want to
make sure it sticks.

537
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,678
Is there any reason
why it shouldn't?

538
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:51,690
A 20-year prison sentence
is a pretty tough sell
to a cop.

539
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,521
He could change his mind,
make trouble.

540
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:56,324
So I dug in his background.
I talked to his girlfriend.

541
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:57,523
Yeah?
She told a very
interesting story

542
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,227
about a drug dealer
named Vasquez.

543
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,359
What about him?

544
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:03,529
CIaims that Edmunds shot him
in self-defense.

545
00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:06,539
You were partnered
with him then, right?
So?

546
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:08,098
His throat was slashed.

547
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:09,733
How do you explain that?

548
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,803
Some street punk
wanted revenge.

549
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:15,907
We get to the scene,
and Vasquez is
carved up Iike a turkey.

550
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:19,147
So this is just
your ex-partner playing Iike
a hero to get Iaid?

551
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,654
I met the woman.
She's a badge bunny.

552
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:25,454
Stories Iike this
get her juiced up,
you know what I'm saying?

553
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:30,425
I find out that
you're a murdering bastard,
I'm gonna nail your ass.

554
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:32,489
You know what I'm saying?

555
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,666
You went to the 29.

556
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:41,140
I can see the rumor
mill's working overtime.

557
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:42,676
Who says cops
don't communicate?

558
00:25:42,844 --> 00:25:44,675
What the hell are
you trying to prove?

559
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:47,044
Look, I was trying
to cover your ass.

560
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:49,606
I didn't want you
to get a rip from the bosses
for insubordination.

561
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:51,777
You'II be Iucky if they
settle for just a rip.

562
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,013
I would've backed
your play.

563
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:56,613
That's why I went alone.

564
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:59,922
Well, there's a detective from
Fraud waiting. You want to
bring me up to speed?

565
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:02,053
Well, I requested a Iook
at our cops' financials,

566
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,758
because from what I've seen,
Cooper is Iiving
way above his means.

567
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:06,094
You think Edmunds
has something to do with it.

568
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:09,136
Well, if he is, protecting
a bankroll is a hell of
a good reason to confess

569
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,228
and stop any more digging.

570
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:15,034
Edmunds is clean.
Lives frugally,
Iittle savings, no assets.

571
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,269
You sure?

572
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:17,605
Positive.

573
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,613
Now, your guy
Cooper's a different story.

574
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,876
Reasonable mortgage,
well within his
paycheck Iimit.

575
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,181
Wife's a homemaker,
kid's in public school,
nothing to red flag.

576
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:26,345
BENSON:
But you're not buying it?

577
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:27,613
Nope.

578
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,953
AII of his assets
are in his wife's name,

579
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:33,425
car, condo in Boca,
some other
scattered real estate.

580
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:35,155
How'd this slip past IAB?

581
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:36,957
Checked his tax return.

582
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,499
Trick is,
claim Atlantic City winnings,

583
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:42,102
he pays the taxes on it,
no one's the wiser.

584
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,001
Well, can we prove
that the money's
not from gambling?

585
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:45,596
We can check
with the casinos.

586
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:49,109
Anything over $2,500
is reportable to the IRS.

587
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:50,872
How Iong will that take?
BENSON: More time
than we've got.

588
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:53,209
Edmunds' allocution
is scheduled
for day after tomorrow.

589
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:56,307
Cooper's on the take,
Edmunds isn't.
So why's he holding out?

590
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,818
Maybe Edmunds
didn't know what his
ex-partner's been up to.

591
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:03,949
It's a statistical
improbability that Mrs. Cooper
won so much so often.

592
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,550
You know where
the money's actually
coming from?

593
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:09,722
My guess,
payment for
some dead bodies.

594
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:15,196
What could not wait
until tomorrow morning?

595
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,759
I need a wiretap.

596
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:18,428
On who?

597
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:22,533
Luke Edmunds' former partner,
Les Cooper.

598
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,544
Is he involved in this?

599
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,846
We think that he got paid
to kill Carlos Torres and
another drug dealer.

600
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,408
He's got way too
much cash for a cop.

601
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:33,784
What about Edmunds?

602
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:35,755
Drug dealers
killed his brother.

603
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:39,725
See, Edmunds is doing it
for revenge, Cooper's doing it
for business.

604
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:42,024
Problem is, we don't know
who Cooper's working for.

605
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,155
That's why I need a wiretap.

606
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:46,257
If I am going to
wake up a judge,

607
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,632
I need something
more compelling
than a theory.

608
00:27:48,703 --> 00:27:50,637
Cooper's finances
aren't enough?

609
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:55,642
Not without solid evidence
of where that money
came from.

610
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,200
Why are you still
working on this?

611
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,042
You're the one who
told me to come to you
if I had anything new.

612
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:02,105
Well, that was before
IAB got involved.

613
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:03,582
It doesn't matter how
you get your evidence,

614
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:05,016
as Iong as you
get it Iegally.

615
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,212
You are on a crusade
to get Cooper.

616
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:10,121
You're damned right I am.
He's a murderer.

617
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:14,389
How many bodies do
you think he racked up
to pay for that new Mercedes?

618
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:17,663
That's a good question.

619
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:21,231
Turns out you've got
five open homicides

620
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:23,429
with corresponding signatures
to your victim.

621
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:26,302
One knife wound,
one beaten and
kicked to death,

622
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:28,171
three were
gunshots to the chest.

623
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:30,710
Common denominator's
the deep bruising
at the throat.

624
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:33,303
And they shared
the same profession,
slinging drugs.

625
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:35,212
Were the bodies
found in the 29 precinct?

626
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:36,648
Where else?

627
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:44,117
Edmunds did it for revenge,
but Cooper was getting paid.

628
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:46,922
FIN: You get any inquiries
from anybody other than us?

629
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:49,986
Chief of Detectives called,
notifying me that
Homicide detectives

630
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:52,965
from Manhattan North
would be in to
collect the files.

631
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:57,801
I guess the rumors
of your visit to the precinct
made it to the bosses.

632
00:28:57,872 --> 00:28:59,134
Well, Iet's see
what they have to say

633
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:02,301
about a cop
killing off drug dealers
for profit.

634
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:09,816
You've got to vacate
Edmunds' deal, AIex.

635
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:11,818
He's guilty of
multiple homicide,

636
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:15,117
but his ex-partner
has been committing
felony murder for pay.

637
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:16,213
Where's your evidence?

638
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,589
Cooper and Edmunds went
to CIub Rendezvous to
roust Carlos Torres.

639
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,390
But when they got there,
they didn't expect
a street brawl outside.

640
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,328
When the sector cars arrived,
they couldn't kill him,

641
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:25,387
so they had to take him in.

642
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:26,592
So they get him
to the precinct,

643
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,759
they take him
to the bathroom,

644
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,029
and they pull
his pants down.

645
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,161
Well, if this was
about business,

646
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:31,603
why sodomize him
with a plunger?

647
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:34,300
Well, we're thinking
that the cops were
trying to plant evidence.

648
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,366
Torres was headed
toward the Tombs.

649
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:38,309
The guards find drugs
during the strip search,

650
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:40,074
that's an added
possession charge.

651
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:42,582
That is another
10 years at Ieast.

652
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,083
FIN: But the plan backfired.

653
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:47,178
Edmunds took some
Iicks in the scuffle
with Torres, he went crazy,

654
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:50,088
and the plunger was
just a "screw you."

655
00:29:50,158 --> 00:29:51,853
But you still didn't
answer my question.

656
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:53,722
Where is your evidence?

657
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:55,353
Five dead drug dealers.

658
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:59,024
AII unsolved homicides,
all with the same
deep bruising pattern,

659
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,364
and all on Edmunds
and Cooper's turf.

660
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:04,700
Same as Carlos Torres.

661
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:07,798
Let's see if Edmunds
is up for a renegotiation.

662
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:14,438
CABOT: Your present deal
is off the table.

663
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:17,006
You're digging
a political grave,
Counselor.

664
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:18,449
I'm willing to
make you an offer.

665
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,544
But if I Ieave here
before you give me an answer,

666
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,055
you're not going
to see me again.

667
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,652
What's this about?

668
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:30,158
BENSON: You recognize them?

669
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:34,190
Killing off drug dealers
wasn't gonna fill
that hole in you,

670
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:37,965
and it sure as
hell wasn't gonna get
your kid brother back.

671
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:43,741
Well, I didn't expect it to.

672
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:47,474
I just thought if I found
the one who strung Bobby out,
it'd be enough.

673
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:50,483
Gave a 13 year-old boy
his first hit of coke.

674
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:53,315
He thought it was funny,
supplying a cop's brother
day after day.

675
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:56,379
Okay, so you killed him,
you got what you wanted.
Why not stop there?

676
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:57,550
They use blood money
to hire the best Iawyers

677
00:30:57,626 --> 00:31:00,356
to shaft us
with our own rules.

678
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:01,862
How is that justice?

679
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,593
Taking out
the competition for profit
isn't justice, either.

680
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:07,828
What the hell are
you talking about?
What profit?

681
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:11,498
Somebody paid your partner
to kill those drug dealers.

682
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:15,100
BENSON: See, you were
on a mission.
Cooper had a side business.

683
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:16,405
I don't believe you.
He wouldn't do that.

684
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:17,911
He hates them
as much as I do.

685
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:20,078
Six counts.
Murder for hire.

686
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:22,048
Wait, I didn't do that.

687
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:24,185
I was cleaning up
the streets,
not making money.

688
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:26,118
By committing murder.

689
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:28,122
It wasn't murder.
It was a reckoning.

690
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:30,086
And we didn't kill them all.

691
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:32,524
I just wanted to put
them out of business.

692
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:36,121
Well, then I suggest
you tell us exactly
what went down.

693
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,803
I can't.

694
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:46,170
Your ex-partner's
a dirty cop.
You're not.

695
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:54,071
We need
corroborating evidence
to put Cooper behind bars.

696
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:57,380
You'II take the needle
off the table?

697
00:31:57,452 --> 00:31:58,544
CABOT: Yes.

698
00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:12,126
What do you want?

699
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:15,169
Let's start
with a Iive victim,

700
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:17,295
someone to
support your statement.

701
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:27,174
A drug dealer
named Willie Angel's
doing 25 in Sing Sing.

702
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:30,150
Cooper shot him,
but the bastard wouldn't die,

703
00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:32,743
so we had to plant
a drop gun.

704
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:36,689
We testified Angel
opened fire on us.

705
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:38,658
Jury didn't even blink.

706
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:43,627
If Willie Angel corroborates
Edmunds' statement,
call me right away.

707
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:44,825
What's the urgency?

708
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,425
How about
an innocent man in prison
on trumped-up charges?

709
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:49,163
There's nothing innocent
about a drug dealer.

710
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:51,171
He's probably got
dozens of bodies
to his credit.

711
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,900
Leave him where he is.
I can't do that.

712
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:54,067
If his statement
pans out,

713
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:56,007
I have to file for an
immediate writ
for his release.

714
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:58,842
I don't know one convict
who wouldn't say
the cops framed him.

715
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:00,313
Edmunds just admitted it.

716
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:01,916
We're supposed
to uphold the Iaw.

717
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:03,451
Your heart's bleeding
all over my shoes.

718
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:05,019
You condone his behavior?

719
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:06,076
I understand it.

720
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:07,644
It gets old
watching humps
walk away

721
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:09,623
from prison bids
on technicalities.

722
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,056
Dealers know how to
play the Ioopholes.

723
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:12,559
Yeah, but you wouldn't do
what they did.

724
00:33:12,794 --> 00:33:14,386
You wouldn't take the Iaw
into your own hands.

725
00:33:14,463 --> 00:33:16,192
It's not Iike
I haven't thought
about it, Counselor.

726
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:17,856
Same as every
other cop on the job.

727
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:21,096
There's a difference
between thinking
about it and doing it.

728
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,573
ANGEL: What do you
cops want with me?

729
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:29,667
We want to hear your version
of how you ended up here.

730
00:33:29,745 --> 00:33:31,906
Police did this to me.

731
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,915
Cops Iike you
with that same Iook
in their eye.

732
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:36,951
Look, nobody
believed me before,
so what's changed?

733
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,953
BENSON:
We need to hear the details.

734
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:40,716
Maybe I need a Iawyer here.

735
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:42,654
I don't do well
with you people
one on one.

736
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:45,192
Look, Willie,
we're not Iooking
to jam you up.

737
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,023
Speak for yourself.

738
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:49,185
I do something to you?

739
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:52,165
You ain't nothing but
a drug dealer, so to me
everything you say is suspect.

740
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:53,496
I ain't in the game
no more.

741
00:33:53,568 --> 00:33:54,933
Since when?

742
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:59,307
Since I Iost
the use of my Iegs
from a cop's bullet.

743
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:04,107
Since they jacked me
for my freedom. Or maybe
that's not enough for you.

744
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:06,374
Willie,

745
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:09,417
can you identify the cops
who did this to you?

746
00:34:09,484 --> 00:34:12,385
Yeah. They wanted me
to step from my business.

747
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:15,890
And when I refused,
next thing I know I got
a bullet Iodged in my spine,

748
00:34:15,957 --> 00:34:19,449
and I'm on trial
for attempted murder.

749
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:21,291
So what happens now?

750
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:25,527
We have
a corroborating witness
who supports your story.

751
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,227
And that means I'm
gonna get out of here?

752
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:29,133
Looks Iike it's
your Iucky day.

753
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:31,235
You don't know
the half of it.

754
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:34,798
I'm gonna file
a multi-million-dollar
Iawsuit against the city.

755
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:38,243
And the gravy's
your required testimony
on my behalf.

756
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:44,350
You're gonna Iet that Iowlife
piece of garbage
back on the street?

757
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:47,388
Yeah, in a wheelchair.

758
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:48,946
Willie Angel is scum.

759
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:51,891
He still doesn't deserve
what you and Cooper
did to him.

760
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,986
Way I see it, one Iess
dealer to worry about.

761
00:34:57,899 --> 00:35:00,561
Whose idea was
it to shoot Willie
in the first place?

762
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:02,899
Cooper's.
But I went along with it.

763
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:06,065
And I suppose it
was Cooper's idea
to kill all those dealers.

764
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:08,234
You do the dirty work,
only you don't get paid.

765
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,971
He paid me.
How?

766
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:14,982
A couple of years ago,
we're answering a domestic.

767
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,848
Husband and wife
are going at it.

768
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:20,945
I walk in, never saw the gun.

769
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:23,183
Coop jumps in between me
and the other guy,

770
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:26,955
takes the.38
right out of his hand.

771
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:30,327
So you're paying him back
by killing people for him?

772
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,266
Well, Cooper did it

773
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:36,998
for a couple of
nice cars and a condo.

774
00:35:47,282 --> 00:35:49,546
Testify against him.

775
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:50,640
No way.

776
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,153
He betrayed you.

777
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:54,984
You wouldn't testify
against your partner.

778
00:35:55,123 --> 00:35:55,920
Don't throw that
blue wall crap at me.

779
00:35:55,992 --> 00:35:59,655
If he did what Cooper did,
you bet your ass I would.

780
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:02,357
It's not so easy.
Partner's Iike blood.

781
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:08,733
You think that he feels
the same way about you?

782
00:36:08,804 --> 00:36:11,398
He used you.

783
00:36:11,474 --> 00:36:14,034
He used your dead brother.

784
00:36:17,146 --> 00:36:19,580
He doesn't give
a damn about you.

785
00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:26,049
When are you going
to have the balls
to face that?

786
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:39,530
You deliberately disobeyed
a direct order to stay
out of the 29. That's a rip.

787
00:36:39,602 --> 00:36:41,331
Ten days of docked pay.

788
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:43,133
That's the only
thing you can do.
I understand.

789
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:45,299
I don't think you do.

790
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,774
Right now, the D.A.
is fielding writs
from every hump

791
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:49,242
ever busted by
those two cops.

792
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:51,405
Guilty or not,
they get a pass.

793
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:54,640
Edmunds and Cooper
are dirty cops.

794
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:56,150
Did you expect me
to ignore that?

795
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:00,246
And because you kept
me out of the Ioop,
we got blindsided.

796
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:02,791
We're Iooking at
press scrutiny,

797
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:06,794
millions in civil suits,
not to mention
criminals walking free.

798
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,532
I did the right thing.

799
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:19,064
Pick up Cooper.

800
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:22,939
Let's get that bastard
off the streets.

801
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:27,741
Lester Cooper.

802
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:30,752
You know,
I'm starting to think
you're stalking me.

803
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,549
You're under arrest
for first-degree murder.

804
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:34,417
Turn around.

805
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:39,593
Wait a minute.
What the hell
is going on here?

806
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:40,992
Step back, rookie.

807
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,461
You got nothing on me.

808
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:44,999
Just six counts of murder.

809
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,932
Hey, I didn't do
anything wrong.

810
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:49,299
I believe you.
Get a Iawyer, anyway.

811
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:54,000
What are you offering?

812
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:57,910
CABOT: Life, no parole,
in exchange for the man
you were working for.

813
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:02,013
I can't do it.

814
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:04,575
I name names,
I might as well kill myself,
save them the trouble.

815
00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:07,282
Ex-cops don't get
housed with general pop.

816
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:08,948
That's very comforting.
Thank you.

817
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:13,359
Your cooperation is
the only thing that stands
between you and the needle.

818
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:14,862
So I'II take my
chance with a jury.

819
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,228
We've got
corroborating witnesses

820
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,597
and the bodies you
dropped for profit.

821
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:20,065
The jury's going to burn you.

822
00:38:20,136 --> 00:38:23,162
You better have other
testimony besides
my client's ex-partner.

823
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:26,504
One of their
victims corroborates
his statement, Counselor.

824
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:29,669
Edmunds gets Iife,
you get Iife, no parole.

825
00:38:29,745 --> 00:38:31,940
As far as I'm concerned,
you're getting off easy.

826
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:35,245
Edmunds. Gullible fool.

827
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:36,876
Yeah, well, at Ieast
he had his reasons,
unlike you,

828
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:39,250
who just exploited
his grief to get rich.

829
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:41,119
Oh, he thought he
was on a mission.

830
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,455
Like we were
gonna rid the streets
of drug dealers?

831
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:48,295
Only an idiot
would believe that.

832
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:52,262
What's it gonna be?

833
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:19,593
It's a real smart move,
Hector.

834
00:39:19,662 --> 00:39:25,157
Get rid of the competition,
avoid a war by getting
a cop to do your dirty work.

835
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:29,898
This business is cutthroat.
You got to know
that going in.

836
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:32,805
This is one execution
I think I'II attend.

837
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:39,244
Look at you,
all yeasted up Iike
some kind of hero.

838
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:42,648
Death row is just geography
for me, mommy.

839
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:46,176
You're gonna be
crying Iike a baby
when you take that Iast walk.

840
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:48,746
You're gonna have
to wait 10, 15 years.

841
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:52,123
A Iot can happen
between now and then.

842
00:39:52,194 --> 00:39:54,492
Witnesses get amnesia.

843
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:57,259
People up and die.
You never know.

844
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,960
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

845
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:02,397
Benson.

846
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:34,001
Suicide.

847
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:35,832
He Ieave a note?

848
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:37,734
Guards didn't find one.

849
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:41,937
Hasn't been dead Iong.
An hour, maybe two.

850
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:45,003
He just couldn't take it.

851
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,570
His sentence?

852
00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:50,213
Facing what he did.
