1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,029
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:04,834
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:06,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:09,009
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:12,604
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:14,376
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,974
I ever tell you
about my nephew Sandy?

8
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,144
Once or twice.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,983
Well, his kid Josh
just turned one,

10
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:21,181
and got his own room.

11
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:23,656
So Sandy buys
this fancy intercom

12
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,852
so they can Iisten to Josh
and talk to him.

13
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:28,361
Anyway, the first night,
Sandy and Mel...

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,419
Josh's mom?

15
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:30,726
Yeah, decide
to test it out.

16
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,199
So, Sandy says,
"Hi, Josh, are you there?"

17
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:35,031
And then, no answer.

18
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,498
So, he says again,

19
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,404
"PIease say something.
Josh, talk to me."

20
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:41,041
Still nothing.

21
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,906
Now they're starting
to get nervous.

22
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:44,343
It's the express.

23
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,041
So he says again,
"Josh, talk to me."

24
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,377
Still nothing...

25
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:53,252
He says, "Josh,
please say something..."

26
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:59,554
No!

27
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,129
Sorry to drag you
out of bed.

28
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:05,826
Girl tried to donate her body
to the downtown express.

29
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:09,166
No panties, torn shirt,
fresh bruises on her thighs.

30
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,226
Does she have any ID?

31
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,397
Just some Ioose change.

32
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:12,701
And she's not talking.

33
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:14,901
Munch is checking out
the security cameras
right now.

34
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:16,443
Give me a minute.

35
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,500
Hi.

36
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:22,979
I'm OIivia.
Can you tell us your name?

37
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:27,453
We'd really Iike to call
your mom and dad,

38
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:30,013
and Iet them know
you're okay.

39
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:35,186
I've got a daughter
your age.

40
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:37,691
I gotta tell you,
if something
Iike this happened,

41
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,825
I'd want to be
there for her.

42
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:43,061
PIease tell us
your name.

43
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,239
Jackie Landricks.

44
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:48,936
Jackie, I'm EIIiot.
Where do you Iive?

45
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,172
On 16th, in Chelsea.

46
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:55,244
That was Munch.
He's got something.

47
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:56,511
We're gonna call
your mom and dad

48
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,109
and they'II meet you
at the hospital, okay?

49
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,154
No, please, don't tell them.

50
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:03,791
They'II kill me.

51
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,719
Jackie, this is not
your fault.

52
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,795
They're just
gonna be glad
you're safe.

53
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:09,485
LARRY: We got three cameras
on that side of the station.

54
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:11,219
Did you know
the London Underground
has a system

55
00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:12,851
for identifying
potential suicides?

56
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:15,294
It's called Cromatica.
There she is.

57
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,488
Your average suicide
waits about 10 minutes.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,330
Cromatica will spot that,
and sound an alarm.

59
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,397
Now Iook at this.

60
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:26,366
See there, the guy behind her?

61
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:28,602
This is what we got
on Camera 4.

62
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:31,268
There's your girl again.

63
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:34,540
FIN: That same guy's
following Jackie
too close.

64
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:36,015
Can you freeze-frame
on his face?

65
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,312
Sure.

66
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,713
BENSON: Great. Print that
out and Iet's go
to the next camera.

67
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,155
LARRY: Camera 5,
shows the platform.

68
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,254
STABLER: Still following her.

69
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:49,354
BENSON: There's too
many people. He doesn't
wanna make a move.

70
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,059
Look at this.

71
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,729
That was close.

72
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,932
Looks Iike he's got
something to hide.

73
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:02,038
He's got a Iogo on his shirt.
Can you blow this up?

74
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,134
Done.

75
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:06,044
FIN: The Iogo belongs
to Mercury Bike
Messenger Service.

76
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,776
The night manager IDed him
as Karl Sirett, 19.

77
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,340
She said he was fired
Iast month,

78
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,749
spent more time
visiting his girlfriends

79
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,980
than delivering packages.

80
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:15,045
PIus not all his deliveries
were welcome.

81
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:16,283
He's had two arrests
for assault.

82
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,484
AII right,
pull him in.

83
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,426
Get his picture over
to Benson and Stabler.

84
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,725
We found fluids
and abrasions
to the vaginal walls

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,529
and these.

86
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,462
BENSON: Restraint marks?
DOCTOR: I believe so.

87
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:33,532
She was tied down
and raped.

88
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:34,632
Multiple times.

89
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,337
I asked her if she'd had
sexual relations
before the attack,

90
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:38,674
she said no.

91
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,280
Her parents.

92
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,911
I'II send the rape kit
and the results
of the pelvic to your Iab.

93
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:44,974
Okay.

94
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,125
Mr. Landricks,
I'm Detective Stabler.

95
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:55,025
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.

96
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,522
Thank you for finding Jackie.

97
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,464
We were real worried
when she didn't come home.

98
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,195
And then we got the call.

99
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,794
Mr. Landricks,
does Jackie have a boyfriend?

100
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:06,101
No.

101
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:09,075
It's procedure for us
to request DNA samples

102
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:11,135
from all male
family members.

103
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:17,473
I have two boys,
Gary's 1 2, Jason's nine.

104
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:18,678
You want them done, too?

105
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,045
Just Gary, please.

106
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,155
Whatever you need.

107
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:26,727
BENSON: Jackie,
you think you can
tell us what happened?

108
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:31,156
I was coming home from school
when this guy grabbed me.

109
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:36,135
I was taking a short cut
by the parking Iot
by A&M on 10th.

110
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,166
I heard a car pull up
behind me

111
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,764
and he pushed me
into the car.

112
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,776
STABLER: Did you
get a Iook at him?

113
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,540
No.

114
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,616
He said if I screamed
he'd kill me.

115
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,885
We drove a bit,

116
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:54,785
and then he pulled me
out of the car.

117
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,685
We walked down
some steps

118
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,227
and I heard a door open.

119
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:05,793
And then what happened?

120
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:09,196
He tied me to a bed.

121
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:16,067
He pulled off my clothes,
and then he did it.

122
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:22,640
How'd you escape?

123
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:27,185
After he finished, he Ieft.

124
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,314
I Ioosened the straps
and I ran.

125
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:34,218
Jackie, I want to show you
some photos, okay?

126
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:43,193
He was following me
at the subway station.

127
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,404
STABLER: Did he rape you?

128
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:49,104
I don't know.

129
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:53,378
I told you,
I was blindfolded.
I couldn't see anyone.

130
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:56,913
Well, do you remember anything
about the man who did do it?

131
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:01,078
Something about his clothes,
the sound of his voice...

132
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,525
What is it, Jackie?

133
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,527
His penis.

134
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:15,293
It was pierced with a ring.

135
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,998
STABLER: How do you
know that?

136
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:22,766
He made me feel it.

137
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:28,577
So why'd you run
when she tried
to kill herself?

138
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,140
Those guys had it
under control.

139
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:31,549
Or you knew the cops
were on the way,

140
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,711
and she'd finger you.

141
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,880
Finger me for what?

142
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,116
We know you Iike
attacking women.

143
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,954
Did you go all the way
with Jackie?

144
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:39,015
Who's Jackie?

145
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,891
The girl you followed
into the subway,
the girl you raped.

146
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:44,454
I told you,
I never saw that bitch before.

147
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:48,061
"I never saw the girl,
never met the bitch."

148
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,763
You should get a better story,
don't you think?

149
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:52,363
And you should Iearn to read.
Those charges were dropped.

150
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,670
We could clear this up
real quick, Karl.

151
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,141
Just give us a DNA sample.

152
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:57,806
No way.

153
00:07:58,246 --> 00:08:01,147
And I was just beginning
to think you were innocent.

154
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,438
Any Iuck?

155
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:04,144
CRAGEN: It's a matter
of time and gravity.

156
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,516
You get a match
on the restraint pattern?

157
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:07,248
Well, M.E. says
that she remembers

158
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:08,914
a female corpse
being pulled out
of the river

159
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,924
two years ago,
south of Chelsea Piers.

160
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:13,790
No head, no fingers,
but marks Iike these.

161
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:16,092
Manhattan South Homicide
couldn't ID her.

162
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:17,324
Called her Chelsea Doe.

163
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:18,387
Unsolved homicide.

164
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,933
City should still have
the corpse.

165
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,697
Call Warner,
see if she can dig up
the body.

166
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,369
Man needs to relieve himself.

167
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,506
Jealous?

168
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,639
No, but I am impressed.

169
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:37,947
I believe the technical term
for that is a Prince AIbert.

170
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,953
Ladies Iove the prince.

171
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,613
The technical term
for these are handcuffs.

172
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,986
No. No.

173
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:46,049
You're under arrest
for the rape
of Jackie Landricks.

174
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,366
Bernardo,
you're up Iate.

175
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:53,832
I want my client.

176
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:54,960
His roommate called me.

177
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,697
He said you pulled him
out of bed.

178
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:59,035
You've held him
more than five hours.

179
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:00,540
Uncuff him and Iet him go.

180
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:03,133
He's not going anywhere.
He's under arrest for rape.

181
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,872
Based on what evidence?

182
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:07,471
Subway cameras show
the victim tried
to commit suicide

183
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,641
to get away from him.

184
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,981
That's tragic, really,
but it's hardly proof
that he raped her.

185
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:16,012
She identified him
also by the piercing
on his penis.

186
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:20,392
Oh, so he is the only man
in New York City
with a pierced schlong?

187
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:23,489
And I assume
you just happened
to see his privates

188
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:25,829
when you took him
to the bathroom

189
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:29,668
after you poured soda
down his throat
for five hours.

190
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:31,204
Was he under arrest
at the time?

191
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:33,433
We were just shooting
the breeze.
BERNARDO: Right.

192
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:36,671
You think you're
gonna get a free DNA
sample out of that?

193
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:38,802
Think again.

194
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:42,173
I want to talk
to the A.D.A.

195
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,779
CRAGEN:
It's standard procedure

196
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:47,047
to escort suspects
to the facilities.

197
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,052
Really? Is it
standard procedure

198
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:50,590
to inspect
their genitals?

199
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,489
You're not gonna claim
it was an illegal search.

200
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,357
You Ied him to believe
he was in custody,

201
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,954
when you didn't have
probable cause
to keep him in custody.

202
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,293
That means,
anything you got
out of him,

203
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:01,164
including sight
of his privates,
it's inadmissible.

204
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:04,398
If he's innocent,
you won't object to him
giving a DNA sample.

205
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,804
Oh, I will object,
and I will win.

206
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,739
So I'II see you in Chambers.

207
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,210
She could win.

208
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,145
I hope you have
something else.

209
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:15,944
How about a dead body?

210
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:21,652
WARNER: Chelsea Doe,
Caucasian, brunette.
I remember her.

211
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:24,348
Pissed me off.
Perp went to such extremes

212
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,859
to make sure
we couldn't ID her.

213
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,523
These are the restraint marks
on Jackie Landricks.

214
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:32,623
What do you think?

215
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,691
Similar, but not the same.

216
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,495
We think Chelsea
had rope burns.

217
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:40,666
These on Jackie
Iook Iike they were made
from some kind of strap,

218
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:44,109
Iike the kind you'd use
to move furniture,
tie up Iuggage.

219
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,475
Was Chelsea raped?

220
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:47,980
She was in the water
two weeks.

221
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:50,142
Long enough to wash
away any useful fluids.

222
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:52,311
BENSON: How old was she?
Late 20s.

223
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,956
Head and fingers were cut off
with some kind of cleaver,

224
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:58,117
but she was probably
strangled first.

225
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,490
There were signs
of capillary damage here.

226
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,189
You think Jackie might have
run into Chelsea's killer?

227
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,822
We were hoping
you could tell us.

228
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,366
Well, if she did,

229
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,026
you're not just Iooking
for one killer.

230
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:11,771
I got a preliminary result
on the fluid.

231
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,702
It was a mixed sample.

232
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,744
Two blood types?
Two rapists.

233
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,339
And one of the samples
showed traces of medication.

234
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:22,906
Mevastatin,
for high cholesterol.

235
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,145
Maybe Karl
had an older partner?

236
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:26,345
What about dad?

237
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,912
No. When he gave his DNA,
I took blood as well.

238
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,753
BIood type doesn't match.

239
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,816
We better talk to Jackie.

240
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,626
I'm sorry,
Tom's on a job today,

241
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,394
and we're
baking cookies, so...

242
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,628
(GLASS SHATTERING)

243
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:44,171
Why don't we just keep this
on the ground there,
cowboy, okay?

244
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,832
I run a day care center here,
call me crazy.

245
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,439
Sally and Jason,
two of mine.

246
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:52,813
I kept them home today.

247
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:56,339
So, did you find anything out?

248
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:01,889
We have reason to believe
that Jackie was attacked
by more than one man.

249
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:04,550
Has she said anything?

250
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:07,258
BENSON: Hey, Jackie,
how you feeling?

251
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:08,386
I'm okay.

252
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,096
Is there some place
we could talk?

253
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:13,224
Sure. Take them
to your room, hon.

254
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:20,904
Jackie, you said that
one man raped you.

255
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:24,138
Now, according
to our forensics,

256
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,304
there were two.

257
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:29,645
I told you,
I was blindfolded.

258
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:32,415
Did you hear two voices?

259
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:35,479
AII I heard was,
"Scream and I'II kill you."

260
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:39,957
Were there
two different bodies?

261
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,961
I don't know.

262
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,621
I tried
to block it out.

263
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:45,393
Were there different
smells, Jackie,

264
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,458
Iike aftershave
or soap?

265
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,404
Hi, you're Sally, right?

266
00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:59,108
My name is EIIiot.

267
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,713
Has Jackie been bad?

268
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:05,876
No. We're here to help her.

269
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:08,346
Could I have your pen?

270
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,192
Sure. Why do you
want my pen?

271
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:14,819
For a present for me.

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,399
Sally,

273
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:25,201
can you tell me
who James Randall is?

274
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,070
He Iives with us.
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,508
And is he, you know,
old Iike me?

276
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,805
Worse. Can I go now?
Yeah.

277
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:43,451
Jackie, what can you tell me
about Mr. Randall?

278
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,791
What do you mean,
what can I tell you?

279
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,454
How Iong has he Iived
down the hall?

280
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,394
Couple months, I guess.

281
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,625
Has he ever bothered you?
No.

282
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:55,928
You're telling me he's never
bothered you before?

283
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,265
Yes.

284
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:01,166
Why are you asking me
these questions?

285
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:03,067
EIIiot, what's going on?

286
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:07,308
Mr. Randall takes Mevastatin,
for his high cholesterol.

287
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:10,541
No wonder she's not talking.

288
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:12,916
Her rapist
Iives right next door.

289
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:18,388
Just because
I have high cholesterol

290
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:19,858
doesn't mean I raped anybody.

291
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,519
So it's just
a coincidence,
Mr. Randall,

292
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:23,086
that the medication
you take

293
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:24,722
wound up inside
Jackie Landricks?

294
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,357
Yeah, it's just
a coincidence.

295
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,459
Lots of guys
have high cholesterol.

296
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:31,801
Lots of guys don't Iive
next to the victim's bedroom.

297
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:32,862
Jackie's kind of hot,

298
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,771
but schoolgirls
aren't my scene.

299
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:35,831
Know him?

300
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,034
I've never seen him before.

301
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,909
Explain something to me.

302
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:43,212
What's a hotshot ad exec doing
slumming it at the Landricks'?

303
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:44,308
I had some bad breaks.

304
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:47,047
The Iast time I Iooked
that wasn't a crime.
Are we done?

305
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,850
No, we're just
getting started.

306
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,754
You think
she's kind of hot?

307
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:53,187
God, who the hell is that?

308
00:14:53,261 --> 00:14:54,250
You raped Jackie Landricks.

309
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,920
Did you rape and murder
this girl, too?

310
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:58,227
No.
Then give us a DNA sample.

311
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,862
You want a DNA sample, sure,
I'II give you a DNA sample.

312
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,733
Just get me a plastic cup
or a pretty woman,

313
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,169
(UNZIPPING ZIPPER)
I'II give you all
the DNA you want.

314
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,902
Put it away, Mr. Randall,
all we need is to swab
inside your mouth.

315
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:12,575
A guilty man doesn't usually
offer up his DNA.

316
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,707
Which means
he's either really dumb,
or really innocent.

317
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,581
That was the Iab
with the results
from Jackie's pelvic.

318
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:21,087
Jackie has cervical dysplasia.

319
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,179
Our girl with no boyfriends
has had a Iot of them.

320
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,282
I'm sure she doesn't want
daddy finding out about that.

321
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,883
Where are we on Karl Sirett?

322
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,054
The judge refused
to give the order
for Karl's DNA.

323
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,098
On what grounds?
Police misconduct.

324
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,690
Apparently we
coerced the suspect
into self-incrimination

325
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,167
by taking him to the john.

326
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:36,794
And Cabot Iet him
get off on that crap?

327
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:37,997
She said we did.

328
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:40,404
Munch, Fin, see if
you can find a connection

329
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,873
between these two Iosers.

330
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:44,036
EIIiot, OIivia,
get over to Jackie's school,

331
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,444
check if anybody knows
who Jackie's boyfriends are.

332
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,272
(BELL RINGING)

333
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:51,510
I don't feel comfortable

334
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:53,883
discussing my students'
personal Iives with you.

335
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,820
Miss Bowen,
the principal says

336
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,484
that you've come to him
with concerns about Jackie.

337
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,493
Now we're on the same
side here.

338
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:00,789
Jackie has
real potential.

339
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:02,727
She has a gift
for writing.
She's bright.

340
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:03,787
But?

341
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,031
Several students told me
she's been sleeping around.

342
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,430
Did you ask
her about it?

343
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:10,528
Yes.

344
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:12,298
She said she'd been
dating this senior.

345
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:13,898
She promised she'd stop.

346
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,273
And you believe her?

347
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:16,402
She tells me the truth.

348
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,673
When did these two
start dating each other?

349
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:20,612
Last year,
when she was a freshman.

350
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:22,673
STABLER: When she was 14.
How old was he?

351
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:23,843
Eighteen.

352
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,854
Miss Bowen, that's considered
statutory rape.

353
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:28,617
Do you know how many
of my 14 and 15-year-olds

354
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,884
are having sex
with older boys?

355
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,289
The relationship
was consensual

356
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,793
and it stopped
the moment I found out.

357
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,556
BENSON: Did you
contact her parents?

358
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,153
I suggested we talk to them,

359
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,791
but Jackie begged me not to,
said they'd kill her.

360
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,232
Did you talk to the boy?

361
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,963
I told him,

362
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:44,665
if he went near Jackie again,
I'd cut his balls off.

363
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:47,301
What's this guy's name?

364
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,999
Karl Sirett.

365
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:51,509
STABLER:
It's our Prince AIbert.

366
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:56,306
BENSON: You know Karl Sirett,
don't you?
Yes.

367
00:16:56,385 --> 00:17:00,219
BENSON: And you went out
with him, and you
had sex with him?

368
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:05,149
It's all right, sweetheart.
Just tell them.

369
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:07,686
Yes.

370
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,688
When did it stop?

371
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:12,563
About a month ago.
I broke up with him

372
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:15,194
after my teacher,
Miss Bowen, talked to me.

373
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:17,364
She knew about this?

374
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,236
Did Karl rape you?

375
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,142
I don't know who raped me.

376
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,871
Jackie, you picked him out.

377
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:26,038
Because you showed me
his photo.

378
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:27,775
I wanted somebody to blame.

379
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,339
BENSON:
Why was he following you?

380
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:32,251
Because he saw me
outside the station.

381
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,379
He hangs out
at the deli out there.

382
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:36,856
If Karl didn't rape you,
who did?

383
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:40,655
I told you,
I was blindfolded,
I couldn't see.

384
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,720
BENSON: Jackie, please.

385
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,131
We cannot help you
unless you tell us everything.

386
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:49,466
I am telling you everything,
you just won't believe me.

387
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,843
Can I go to my room now?

388
00:17:58,613 --> 00:17:59,602
Sure.

389
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,890
So, you think this
Karl guy's in the clear?

390
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,985
BENSON: We don't know.
I mean, you heard Jackie,
she didn't see anything.

391
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:15,393
What about
that bastard Randall?

392
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:16,795
I mean, I thought
you'd arrested him.

393
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:20,357
We questioned him,
but without Jackie's ID,
we couldn't hold him.

394
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:21,459
You know,
I gotta ask
you something.

395
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,663
Why would you Iet
a 40-year-old man rent a room

396
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:26,138
right next to your
15-year-old daughter?

397
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:29,501
Why?

398
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:33,405
Because I need
my head examined.

399
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:34,642
We needed the money.

400
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:40,185
And usually, I only rent
to women, students,

401
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,381
but Randall seemed okay.

402
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:44,084
ANGIE: Hey, honey, we're back.

403
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:46,923
Oh.
Hey.

404
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,622
PHILLIP: I did this!
Oh.

405
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:51,396
PHILLIP: Don't pick up,
I did it.

406
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:52,925
Has something happened?

407
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,401
BENSON: Well, we're working
on a number of Ieads.

408
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:58,433
Good. I've been
so worried about Jackie.

409
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:03,309
Yeah, it might be a good idea
if you would talk to her.

410
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,505
She's got
a Iot of stuff going on.

411
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:08,641
I got you a present.
You did?

412
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:13,821
Don't tell.

413
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,798
I know the case.
15-year-old rape victim.

414
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:29,996
Well, this is about
her Iittle sister.
She's six years old,

415
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:31,163
unusually friendly.

416
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,605
Asks strangers for presents,
gives them presents.

417
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:37,042
She's just a Iittle
too affectionate.

418
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:39,679
Sometimes that kind
of inappropriate behavior
is a sign of abuse.

419
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,477
I've seen abuse of families.

420
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,145
And her parents
seem to Iove the kids,

421
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,346
and the kids seem happy.

422
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,412
M.E. got a DNA match
on one of the samples.

423
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,424
Charles Eno, did time
for robbery and assault,

424
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:52,460
Iives a block
from the Landricks'.
We're picking him up.

425
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:53,755
And here's the best part.

426
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:56,764
Two years ago,
he worked as a butcher
in the meat-packing district.

427
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,200
Where were you
Iast night, Mr. Eno?

428
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:00,462
Home till 11:30.

429
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:03,027
Then I went to the club.
I work security.

430
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:04,834
Anyone can back you
on that?

431
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:05,931
I Iive by myself.

432
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:09,444
And you were watching TV,
didn't go out to dinner,
nobody in the world saw you.

433
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:10,501
And I didn't rape no girl.

434
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,138
Well, your sperm
tell a different story.

435
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,842
(LAUGHS) That's crap.

436
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,375
No. You raped
Jackie Landricks

437
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:18,579
and you Ieft your
calling card
inside of her.

438
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:21,515
Big guy Iike you
have to tie up
a defenseless girl.

439
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:23,491
No. I didn't tie up
no girl, man.

440
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,459
Just Iike two years ago,
in the meat-packing district,

441
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,996
when you were chopping up
those carcasses.

442
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,156
You chop her up, too?

443
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:32,128
You're sick!

444
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:34,127
What do you think I am?

445
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:36,228
A rapist and a murderer.

446
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,031
AII right.

447
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:39,699
I had sex
with Angie Landricks,

448
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,242
but I never touched
the girl.

449
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,777
You had sex
with Jackie's mother?

450
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:44,073
Yeah!

451
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,477
Why would I mess with jailbait

452
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:48,142
when I could get it
from her moms?

453
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:50,246
We've got his DNA
inside her,

454
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,786
he just put himself
in the apartment.

455
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:53,754
Why's he holding out?

456
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:54,847
Maybe he's doing them both,

457
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:57,017
and doesn't want
to cop to statutory.

458
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:58,560
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

459
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:01,358
M.E. just called with a match
on the second sperm sample.

460
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,489
Karl Sirett's in the clear.

461
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,158
It's James Randall.

462
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:07,566
The jackass
who gave up his DNA.

463
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:10,897
I swear I never Iaid
a hand on her.

464
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:11,997
Right.

465
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:16,678
Your Iittle tadpoles
just swam in
all by themselves.

466
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,381
Do you know him?
Yeah. He works
at a club I go to.

467
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,246
Oh, I think you know him
better than that.

468
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:25,754
Jackie Landricks,
she some kind of joint project

469
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,345
you and big Charlie
work on together?

470
00:21:27,423 --> 00:21:28,822
God, what are you
talking about?

471
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:31,359
There were two semen samples
inside the girl.

472
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:34,021
One yours, and one Mr. Eno's.

473
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:36,130
I didn't touch the girl!

474
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:39,292
Don't tell me,
you just had sex with her mom.

475
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:40,596
Yeah, that's right.

476
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,366
That's pretty ballsy,
doing it right under
her husband's nose.

477
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,669
What the hell?
He paid me to do it.

478
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:49,903
He paid you
to have sex with his wife?

479
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:53,005
Yeah. He Iikes to watch.

480
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,791
Is it possible
that Eno and Randall

481
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,726
aren't just
Iying scum, Doc?

482
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,430
Is there any evidence
that they abducted
Jackie together?

483
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,057
Well, they claim
their only connection

484
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,295
is they were both servicing
Mrs. Landricks.

485
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,338
Then from what you've told me
about Jackie's behavior,

486
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:17,838
and her Iittle sister's,

487
00:22:17,907 --> 00:22:21,308
I'd say dad is a
sexually obsessive narcissist.

488
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,002
You telling me
this guy gets his kicks

489
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,172
from prostituting
his wife and daughters?

490
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:27,340
HUANG: His family
is his own Iittle cult.

491
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,883
They devote themselves
to making him happy.

492
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:31,249
BENSON: You think
he's abusing Sally, too?

493
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,685
I don't know
if she's sexually abused,

494
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:36,122
but I wouldn't be surprised
if she knew exactly
what went on.

495
00:22:36,492 --> 00:22:38,517
Well, there's
sex education for you.

496
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:40,118
Dad doesn't even have to
touch his daughters.

497
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:41,629
Just treating them as adults

498
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:44,962
turns them into his own
vicarious sexual partners.

499
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:48,468
They don't tell because
he's their dad,
and they Iove him.

500
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:52,064
It's called
child sexual abuse
accommodation syndrome.

501
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:55,542
If Jackie talks,
she's responsible
for breaking up the family.

502
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:56,873
AII right, besides the fact

503
00:22:56,946 --> 00:23:00,006
that none of the evidence
implicates Tom Landricks,

504
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:01,645
just tell me why.

505
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:04,618
My guess is that
he's impotent,
possibly infertile.

506
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:07,212
His family is the only area
where he has power.

507
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:10,884
Angie Landricks is running
a day care center
from their home.

508
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,927
Captain, we've got to
get those kids out of there.

509
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:15,486
Then bring Angie in.

510
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:16,963
She sees her world
falling apart,

511
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:19,967
she just might tell us
what the hell's going on.

512
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:22,993
ANGIE: Wait...

513
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:25,572
No!
Jackie, Jackie, come on.

514
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:29,077
You can't do this.
PIease. I have to call
their parents.

515
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:31,739
We can take care of it.
I have to call Tom.

516
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:34,647
What have you done?
BENSON: Come on.
Come on. Come on.

517
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,548
ANGIE: Why are you
trying to hurt us?

518
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:37,711
I don't understand!

519
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:39,152
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,952
Detective Benson,
we've got a problem.

521
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:47,287
There's no record
of these two in the home.
No names, no addresses.

522
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,557
What does Mrs. Landricks say?

523
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:50,121
WOMAN: Nothing I can repeat.

524
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:53,066
Can you tell me
who they are, over here?

525
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,603
That's Phillip
and that's Antoine.

526
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:58,197
Who's their mom?
Mom is.

527
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:00,301
Who's their real mom?

528
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:03,539
My mom is, stupid.
They're my brothers.

529
00:24:09,652 --> 00:24:14,055
We checked birth records.
Phillip and Antoine
are your kids.

530
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:16,557
I never said they weren't.

531
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,718
Well, who are the dads?

532
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:20,393
I don't know.

533
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,527
You don't know.
Well, how does your husband
feel about that?

534
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,897
Him being so big
on family and all?

535
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:27,299
He wanted me
to have the kids.

536
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:29,496
He wanted you
to have the kids.

537
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:33,037
Sally was his Iast.
He can't have any more.

538
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:34,200
That's very sad.

539
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:36,369
So he just pulls men
off the streets,

540
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:38,276
and Iets them
play inseminator?

541
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:40,838
Tom wanted more kids.
I wanted to keep him happy.

542
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:44,443
Well, how Iong
are you gonna go on
keeping Tom happy?

543
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:47,318
I can't give him any more.

544
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:51,652
It was Phillip.
His birth went wrong.

545
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:55,787
I had to have a hysterectomy.

546
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:57,799
I can't have
any more children.

547
00:25:00,436 --> 00:25:02,131
You can't have
any more children.

548
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:04,399
So what,
Jackie's the next
best thing?

549
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:05,462
No.

550
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:08,535
You used your own daughter.

551
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:11,011
No. Those men did.
Randall and Eno.

552
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,378
They swear that they didn't.
But they're Iying.

553
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:15,076
Either you Iet them
rape your daughter,

554
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,879
or your husband
took their semen

555
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:18,783
out of you
and did it himself.

556
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:21,946
That's disgusting.
You're disgusting!
You are!

557
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:24,559
Your own child!

558
00:25:24,627 --> 00:25:26,686
I want to talk to Tom.

559
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:28,753
We would never hurt
our children.

560
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,561
Never, we Iove them.

561
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:32,965
I want my husband.

562
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:39,265
CRAGEN: Where are
you two going?

563
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:41,002
To talk
to Jackie Landricks.
Uh-uh.

564
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,840
Kid's not at Lait House.
She's been moved
to Adams' Treatment Center.

565
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:45,403
What happened?
Some kind of breakdown.

566
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:47,108
Better talk to the doc.

567
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:48,206
Where are my children?

568
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:49,808
They've been removed
for their own safety.

569
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:51,250
You can't do this.
Where are they?

570
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,288
Mr. Landricks,
your children are safe,

571
00:25:53,355 --> 00:25:54,879
you'II need to contact ACS.

572
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:55,946
Where's my wife?

573
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:56,219
She's answering
some questions.

574
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,318
And giving some answers.
You bastard, I trusted you.

575
00:25:58,395 --> 00:26:00,124
And your kids trusted you.
BENSON: EIIiot, whoa, whoa!

576
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:01,527
FIN: Hey, hey,
come on, come on!

577
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:03,498
Come and sit down
somewhere quiet,
Mr. Landricks,

578
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,467
and talk this thing over.

579
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:10,732
What's going on?

580
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:13,298
Regression in service
of the ego.

581
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,604
When the present
gets too frightening,

582
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:18,011
people try to escape
to a safer time.

583
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:20,276
Can she recover?

584
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,079
Children are
incredibly fragile.

585
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:26,188
And incredibly resilient.
Jackie could go either way.

586
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:29,018
She's playing with dolls.
How do you know
she's not faking?

587
00:26:29,092 --> 00:26:31,026
You don't.

588
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:32,618
Not until you talk to her.

589
00:26:34,564 --> 00:26:36,498
Who, me?
No. No. No, no, no.

590
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,895
No, you're the shrink.

591
00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:39,595
And you're the dad.

592
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,866
That's what she's Iooking for,
another father.

593
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:57,080
This is Cindy.
Isn't she pretty?

594
00:26:57,153 --> 00:26:58,279
She's very pretty.

595
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:01,049
Do you Iike
playing with dolls?

596
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:02,785
Of course.

597
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,854
This is Cindy's friend, Bear.

598
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:10,399
He Iikes her very much,
don't you, Bear?

599
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,170
Why does he Iike her?

600
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,334
Because Cindy knows
what Bear wants.

601
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:25,071
And what do I want?

602
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:26,945
You want Cindy
to be nice to you.

603
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:32,987
And how are you
gonna be nice to me?

604
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,819
She'II make you feel good.

605
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,760
Do you want her to show you?

606
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,921
It's okay.
I know what to do.

607
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:42,362
Yeah? How do you
know what to do?

608
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:45,861
'Cause I've watched.

609
00:27:46,202 --> 00:27:48,727
Who did you watch, Jackie?

610
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:53,202
My mom.

611
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:57,903
You watched her
with other men?

612
00:28:00,684 --> 00:28:02,515
Is that what you want to do?

613
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,343
Daddy said I couldn't.

614
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:05,649
That's because
he is selfish.

615
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:07,917
He just wants to keep you
all for himself.

616
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:08,980
He Ioves me.

617
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,619
Sometimes, people say
that they Iove you,
and they can do bad things.

618
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:13,959
No! He Ioves me!
He Ioves me!

619
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,554
He doesn't Iove you.
He doesn't Iove you.

620
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:17,827
Look what he's done to you.
He's using you.

621
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:19,368
He's using you.

622
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:27,340
Jackie, I know why you ran.
You're safe.

623
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:32,512
Talk to me.

624
00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:40,919
He told me
mom couldn't
have a baby.

625
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:43,792
He said that
made him sad.

626
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:48,059
He asked me to
help him.

627
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:51,399
He wanted you to
have a baby?

628
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:55,034
I didn't want to.

629
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:58,200
But he said
I was old enough now

630
00:28:58,274 --> 00:28:59,866
and that I had to.

631
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:02,910
For the family.

632
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:08,450
Okay. Okay.
Tell me what happened.

633
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:14,250
He took me to my bedroom.

634
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:16,924
He took off my clothes.

635
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:21,556
He told me to Iie down
on the bed.

636
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:27,203
Then I saw
he had this syringe.

637
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:30,997
I tried to get away,

638
00:29:31,074 --> 00:29:33,304
but he caught me.
He pinned me down.

639
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:39,747
Then I saw my mom.

640
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:43,919
I begged her
to make him stop,

641
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,154
but she wouldn't.

642
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,354
What did he do to you?

643
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:55,526
He pushed
the syringe into me.

644
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:58,957
He said, "Good girl."

645
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,006
It's all right.

646
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:11,938
I'II make this
as painless as I can.

647
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:13,778
My client is ready
to plead guilty

648
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,750
to promoting prostitution.

649
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,980
You're trying to get him off
on a misdemeanor?

650
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:20,420
He tied down his own daughter
and tried to inseminate her.

651
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,754
Angie Landricks
denies it happened.

652
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:26,788
The forensic evidence proves
Tom Landricks didn't rape her.

653
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:28,160
And your search
of the apartment

654
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:30,597
turned up
absolutely nothing.

655
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,602
This is all a figment
of a disturbed child's
imagination.

656
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,070
The forensics will confirm
Jackie's testimony,

657
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:37,800
that her father attempted
to impregnate her

658
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:39,535
using other men's semen.

659
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:43,443
Jackie was just transferred
to a psychiatric
treatment facility.

660
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,440
You think a jury
is gonna buy
her crazy story?

661
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:47,608
I think when a jury hears

662
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:49,584
that your client
paid strangers
to screw his wife,

663
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:51,916
they're gonna believe
pretty much anything she says.

664
00:30:51,988 --> 00:30:53,956
You put Jackie on the stand,

665
00:30:54,023 --> 00:30:56,651
I'II be forced
to bring up her promiscuity,

666
00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:59,559
her false accusations
of rape, her Iies...

667
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,521
Take the deal, AIex.

668
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:04,733
I Iove my daughter.

669
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:08,668
She means everything to me.
I would never harm
a hair on her head.

670
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:09,727
Shut up.

671
00:31:10,673 --> 00:31:12,265
I'II see you in court.

672
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,240
Your honor,
I'm showing the witness

673
00:31:18,314 --> 00:31:21,340
what has been marked
as the People's 967
in evidence.

674
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:24,151
These are photographs

675
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,984
of the night you were taken
to Saint Gregory's Hospital.

676
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,121
How did you get these bruises?

677
00:31:29,192 --> 00:31:30,284
Straps.

678
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,753
And how did the straps
cause them?

679
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:35,263
I was tied up.
Across here, and here.

680
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,662
Now, Jackie,
where were you tied up?

681
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:47,903
To a bed.

682
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:53,073
Whose bed?

683
00:31:56,552 --> 00:31:57,951
What do you mean?

684
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:01,220
Was the bed
in your house, Jackie?

685
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,426
It might have been.

686
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:06,657
Who tied you
to the bed?

687
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,261
Who did this
to you, Jackie?

688
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,033
I don't know.

689
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:16,071
Is the man who tied you up
in this courtroom?

690
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:24,445
Jackie, please answer
the question.

691
00:32:24,514 --> 00:32:28,109
Your Honor,
why is counsel badgering
her own witness?

692
00:32:28,484 --> 00:32:30,418
Miss Cabot,
do you wish to continue?

693
00:32:30,486 --> 00:32:32,283
CABOT: One moment,
Your Honor.

694
00:32:34,824 --> 00:32:37,588
Jackie, do you recall
your grand jury testimony?

695
00:32:38,494 --> 00:32:41,122
You said, "He made me
take off my clothes.

696
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:44,863
"I tried to get away,
but he caught me
and he tied me down."

697
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:46,833
Who was that man?

698
00:32:47,937 --> 00:32:50,371
I was blindfolded.
I couldn't see him.

699
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,772
Do you remember
what you told the grand jury?

700
00:32:52,842 --> 00:32:54,935
I said what you wanted
me to say.

701
00:32:56,846 --> 00:32:59,007
I asked you
to tell me the truth.

702
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:01,113
I was scared.

703
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:06,011
That policeman told me
that my father was bad.

704
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:10,192
He told me to say
that my dad did
bad things to me,

705
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,159
but dad wouldn't,
he just wouldn't.

706
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:13,695
So who did them?

707
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:17,861
I told you, I don't know.

708
00:33:23,873 --> 00:33:25,966
No further questions,
Your Honor.

709
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,108
Just one question, Jackie.

710
00:33:32,015 --> 00:33:35,974
Did your mom and dad
ever hurt you?

711
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:40,014
Never.

712
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:49,097
You heard Tom Landricks
is getting his family back?

713
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:50,723
It gets worse.
ACS just called.

714
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,631
Jackie's pregnant
and wants to keep the baby.

715
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:54,431
Daddy's turkey basting worked.

716
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,438
Well, what the hell happened
to the morning-after pill?

717
00:33:56,506 --> 00:33:57,837
It's standard in rape cases.

718
00:33:57,907 --> 00:33:59,238
By the time
we got to the hospital,

719
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:00,707
Jackie's parents
were already with her.

720
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:01,937
They must have
talked her out of it.

721
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:03,945
So the bastard gets away
with impregnating
his daughter,

722
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:05,139
and gets to keep the kid.

723
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:07,580
And Iittle
Antoine and Phillip
are gonna be uncles.

724
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,515
How old
are Antoine and Phillip?

725
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:11,052
BENSON: Four and two.

726
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:12,916
Wonder why he took so Iong.

727
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,149
CRAGEN: To do what?

728
00:34:14,424 --> 00:34:16,688
Well, Angie
had her hysterectomy
two years ago.

729
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:20,217
If he wanted more kids,
why wait two years
to use Jackie as a baby-farm?

730
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:21,923
What if he didn't wait?

731
00:34:22,598 --> 00:34:24,429
What if he tried this
on someone else before?

732
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,524
Chelsea Doe?

733
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,535
The restraint patterns
are consistent.

734
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,136
Well, if we
can't get him for rape,
go after him for murder.

735
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:32,640
You think Landricks
is a murderer,
and not just a sick freak?

736
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,972
Since when did those two
exclude each other?

737
00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:37,308
Randall rented a room
at the Landricks,

738
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,905
but Tom said that
he usually took in women.

739
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:42,478
What if one of them
was Chelsea Doe?

740
00:34:42,785 --> 00:34:45,276
Munch, Fin,
canvas the neighbors.

741
00:34:45,354 --> 00:34:46,616
See if there was a woman
Iiving there,

742
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:48,281
around the time
Chelsea Doe was murdered.

743
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:50,120
OIivia, EIIiot,
check with HRA,

744
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:53,856
missing persons,
social services, DMV,
check bank records.

745
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,558
I'm going to introduce
the doc to Chelsea Doe.

746
00:34:59,936 --> 00:35:01,096
HUANG: The head
was removed post-mortem?

747
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,195
Yes, death by strangulation.

748
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:05,604
Which suggests
that it wasn't planned.

749
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:08,106
The murder was an act
of fear or rage.

750
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:10,478
A hand is easier
to cut off at the wrist,

751
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:11,706
but he takes off
the fingers.

752
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:13,715
Why?
Souvenirs.

753
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:16,513
The British
serial killer Fred West

754
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:19,953
collected bones. Fingers,
kneecaps, vertebrae.

755
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:21,887
WARNER: But that increases
the risk of discovery.

756
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,983
And the feeling of power.

757
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:27,793
The victim may be dead,
but he still owns them.

758
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:30,822
Do you think Landricks
could've killed her?

759
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,267
Tom Landricks
enjoys violating
the rights of others,

760
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:37,534
which is the mark
of an antisocial personality.

761
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:39,802
But he also exhibits
schizotypal features,

762
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:42,071
which provoke him
to act out his fantasies,

763
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:44,136
sometimes violent ones.

764
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:48,180
Look at these
restraint marks.

765
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:49,843
He keeps the arms
and the Iegs free

766
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,511
so that the victim
will fight,

767
00:35:51,587 --> 00:35:53,851
making his dominance
more satisfying.

768
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:57,417
Yes, he could kill,

769
00:35:58,427 --> 00:35:59,951
and grow to enjoy it.

770
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,560
Captain, DMV records
show that two-and-a-half
years ago,

771
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:07,398
a 28-year-old
Karen Stenslin

772
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,233
gave the Landricks'
as her home address.

773
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:10,636
And?
And there's been
no movement

774
00:36:10,706 --> 00:36:11,900
on her social security number

775
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:14,602
since Chelsea Doe's body
was found in the Hudson.

776
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:15,701
Where do her folks Iive?

777
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:18,474
Only Iiving relative
is her grandmother.

778
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:19,845
Lives in Jersey.
Teaneck.

779
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:21,982
What are you waiting for?

780
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:26,821
I'm afraid I haven't spoken
to Karen for a Iong time.

781
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,179
Is it important?

782
00:36:28,257 --> 00:36:29,554
Well, actually, it is.

783
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:32,688
Do you have any idea
how we could
get in touch with her?

784
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:34,821
Well, I'm afraid
that would be
rather difficult.

785
00:36:34,897 --> 00:36:38,355
You see,
she moved to Europe.
She got a job there.

786
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,163
And how Iong ago was that?

787
00:36:40,236 --> 00:36:42,704
Oh, well,
nearly two years now.

788
00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:45,672
Now, I know
that a telephone
is expensive,

789
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:47,641
but I do wish
that she would call.

790
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:50,041
That postcard there

791
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:51,739
was the Iast time
I heard from her.

792
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:56,011
Manhattan postmark.
Check out the date.

793
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,478
Couple of weeks
before Chelsea Doe was found.

794
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:02,149
Karen's not
in any trouble,
is she?

795
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:04,625
This postcard
doesn't mention anything
about Europe.

796
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:08,323
No. That nice man
that she Iived with
in New York,

797
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:09,523
he told me.

798
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,794
She was the nanny
for his children.

799
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:13,061
Is this Karen?

800
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:15,399
Yes, isn't she Iovely?

801
00:37:15,471 --> 00:37:17,598
STABLER: She is Iovely.
So is the bracelet.

802
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:20,965
It was her mother's.

803
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:23,972
She died when Karen
was very young.

804
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:26,745
Karen always wears it.

805
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:34,684
STABLER: Hi, Sally.
Hey, remember
you gave this to me?

806
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:37,056
I want it back.

807
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:39,060
Where did you get it?
Where'd you get this?

808
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:40,356
It's mine.

809
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:43,122
You know,
it's so pretty, Sally.

810
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,791
I'd Iike to have
one Iike this.

811
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:47,595
Can you tell me
who gave it to you?

812
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:53,206
Sally, can you tell me
who gave this to you?

813
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:57,636
Nobody. I took it.
BENSON: Where from?

814
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:01,211
Jackie's drawer.

815
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:04,282
STABLER:
Jackie, is that yours?

816
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:07,381
Whose is it?

817
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:09,719
It's Karen's.

818
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,686
What happened to Karen?

819
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:13,221
JACKIE: She went away.

820
00:38:13,296 --> 00:38:15,764
And she gave that to you
before she Ieft?

821
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,826
No. I found it.

822
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:21,359
Where, Jackie?

823
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:27,533
In Karen's room,

824
00:38:28,277 --> 00:38:29,801
underneath her bed.

825
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:32,105
Which room is Karen's?

826
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,410
Randall's.

827
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:41,554
Used ground-probing radar
to Iocate the void.

828
00:38:41,624 --> 00:38:43,956
Had to dig through two feet
of solid concrete.

829
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:46,187
I think I've got
a skull here.

830
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:06,037
It has to be Karen.

831
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:12,543
BENSON: We went
digging around
your apartment, Tom,

832
00:39:13,055 --> 00:39:14,750
and guess what we found.

833
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:18,720
Karen's head.

834
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:23,723
No, Karen's in London.
She's got a job there.
This is a mistake.

835
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,261
This is a mistake, too?
These are Karen's fingers
that we found

836
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:28,030
along with her head
in your basement.

837
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,093
Mistake?

838
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:33,233
There is no way
that I would hurt Karen.
The kids Ioved her.

839
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:34,776
You are setting me up!

840
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,869
You put those terrible
things there.

841
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,339
Under two feet of concrete?
BENSON: Tom.

842
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:41,746
We know that it's Karen.

843
00:39:41,817 --> 00:39:43,114
How, for God's sake?

844
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:45,983
BENSON: Her mitochondrial DNA
was an identical match
to the grandmother.

845
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,989
What are they talking about?
I didn't do anything.

846
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:50,184
You know something,
I'm done with this guy.
Yeah, you did.

847
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:51,556
You tied her up.
You raped her.

848
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:53,424
You killed her.
You tried to hide her body.

849
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:56,465
Next time I see you,
you're gonna have
a needle in your arm.

850
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:57,760
Keep denying it.

851
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:11,012
What happened, Tom?

852
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:15,211
Did she try to run away?

853
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:18,186
Threaten to call the police?

854
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,019
She tried to destroy us.

855
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:24,992
She said she'd have a baby,
then she backed down.

856
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,858
Mr. Landricks,
you don't have to
go through this.

857
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:30,398
She said she'd tell.

858
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,358
She said she'd make them
take our kids away.

859
00:40:33,436 --> 00:40:34,767
So you had to kill her.

860
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:36,634
I had to protect my family.

861
00:40:37,873 --> 00:40:41,331
If there are no children,
the family dies.

862
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:46,547
What about Jackie?

863
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:48,941
She tried to run away.

864
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:52,251
Were you gonna
kill her, too?
No.

865
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:54,714
I'd never hurt Jackie.

866
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,690
Well, she's hurting now, Tom.

867
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,720
She's got a baby inside of her
that you put there.

868
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,728
Jackie Ioves me,
she knows that I Iove her.

869
00:41:08,437 --> 00:41:10,905
And she'II do what's best
for the family.

870
00:41:17,513 --> 00:41:19,174
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

871
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:30,450
How are they doing?

872
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,425
Okay.

873
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:38,258
And you?

874
00:41:39,034 --> 00:41:40,626
Okay.
That's good.

875
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:45,063
I've been following
Dad's trial.

876
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:48,738
Well, that must be tough.

877
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,541
It's weird.

878
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:54,943
Like I'm watching somebody
I don't even know.

879
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:56,211
He's my dad.

880
00:41:57,953 --> 00:42:00,888
He did all those
horrible things
and he's my dad.

881
00:42:02,124 --> 00:42:03,785
But you got away.

882
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:07,961
Yeah, I did.

883
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:12,163
I'm not gonna keep the baby.

884
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:16,594
It's what Dad would
have wanted, isn't it?

885
00:42:17,106 --> 00:42:19,131
I'm not gonna do that anymore.
