00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:00,131
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,203 --> 00:00:04,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,066
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:09,008
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:12,569
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,376
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:17,978
Cab driver went the way
I told him to,

8
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,315
we wouldn't have
got stuck in traffic.

9
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:21,083
We should've
taken the subway.

10
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:24,648
Body-slamming my way
onto the Number 9
with the great unwashed?

11
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:26,523
No thanks.
You're a snob.

12
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:27,823
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,863
We're so Iate,
I'm sure they started
dinner without us.

14
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:33,127
Come on, guys.

15
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:34,225
Take it easy, Josh,

16
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:37,328
I'm sure
they're in the back
by the dining room.

17
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,564
There. Open.

18
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:41,268
(SHIVERS)

19
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:44,234
Evan?
Sorry we're Iate.

20
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:47,604
Oh, my God.

21
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:49,681
(GROANS)

22
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,278
Yo, Lucates.
Take this couple
up to Homicide

23
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:54,948
and have Kroling
get their statements.
AII right?

24
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:56,752
Detective Dave
Duethorn,

25
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:59,259
I missed dinner
with my wife and kids,
this better be good.

26
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,692
Two naked women,
fluids everywhere,

27
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:02,195
both raped
and shot in the head.

28
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:03,731
That's our bread and butter.

29
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,699
So I guess the two
head-shot naked guys
with them

30
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:08,531
are nothing special, right?

31
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:10,865
DUETHORN: Well, what do
you think?

32
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,167
STABLER: Looks Iike
the party from hell.

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,400
DUETHORN: Dinner party,
to be exact.

34
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:15,033
With an orgy
for dessert.

35
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,634
Except they
never made it
to the appetizer.

36
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,542
Dining room
table's still set.

37
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:20,774
And check that out.

38
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,682
"Happy engagement.
Share wonderful
Iives together."

39
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,119
There's no signature.
Who's the unlucky
couple here?

40
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,316
Evan Briggs
and his fianc�e,
Melissa Ziman.

41
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:31,552
Other two are
Dean McCarren
and Regina Valerio.

42
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,821
Couple who found them
made the IDs.

43
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:36,955
Evan and Melissa
invited some grad school
friends over to celebrate.

44
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:40,468
Not the type of evening
you'd expect to turn into
a sexual free-for-all.

45
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:41,968
I'm thinking
home invasion.

46
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:44,733
Doorbell rings,
victim opens door,

47
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:46,273
whacko busts in
and robs them.

48
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,434
You got four victims,
gotta be at Ieast two perps.

49
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,499
What'd they take?

50
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:50,602
AII the victims' jewelry.

51
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,840
Marks on the men's wrists
indicate they wore watches,

52
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:54,074
the women wore necklaces.

53
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,776
DUETHORN: Their wallets
and IDs are also gone,

54
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:58,684
along with Miss Ziman's
two-and-a-half karat
engagement ring.

55
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:01,153
Couple who found them
told me she got it Iast week.

56
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:03,316
Oh, and there's
something else, right, Doc?

57
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,883
Both men were beaten,
probably with the business end
of an automatic.

58
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:08,725
Something must have
set them off.

59
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:10,628
Pummel the men
and rape the women.

60
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,530
WARNER: Not just the women.

61
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,398
Excuse me?

62
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,537
The men were raped, too.

63
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:08,015
AII the violence
was pre-mortem,

64
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,488
the beatings and the rapes.

65
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:10,855
Anything
from the kits?

66
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,052
PIenty of fluids.

67
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:14,891
But when I
combed for hairs
things got strange.

68
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:15,987
Define strange.

69
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:17,258
Take a Iook.

70
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,734
Hairs Iook
the same to me.

71
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:22,599
WARNER: Both belong
to Evan Briggs.

72
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:24,901
I found the one
on the Ieft
on his fianc�e.

73
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:26,736
Nothing unusual about that.

74
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:29,868
The other was in
the second male victim.

75
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,105
What the hell went on here?

76
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,374
Both men had blood
and fluids on them

77
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:35,712
that matched the blood types
of the other victims.

78
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:38,014
So the perps
forced the men

79
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,247
to rape the women
and then each other?

80
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:43,723
I'II need the DNA
to confirm it.
But that's how it Iooks.

81
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,193
The townhouse belongs
to Earl Briggs,

82
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:48,195
CEO of Happy Time Toys.

83
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:51,596
Evan is his son,
two of them Iived there alone.

84
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,997
Mom's deceased.

85
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:54,831
I checked Earl's
background and financials.

86
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:56,370
Tutuola.
Aside from being
worth 50 million,

87
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:59,100
nothing points to anyone
intentionally targeting
his home.

88
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,869
Well, what about
the victims?
Squeaky clean.

89
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,569
AII four come from
wealthy families,

90
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:04,544
had entry-Ievel
jobs in media.

91
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:05,671
FIN: Are you
ready for this?

92
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:07,044
We're Iooking
for one perp.

93
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,776
Lab found a bunch
of bloody footprints,

94
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,442
all made by the same
pair of shoes.

95
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:11,883
And I checked ViCAP.

96
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,853
Nobody's active
with a similar MO.

97
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,822
It's hard to believe
this sadistic son-of-a-bitch

98
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,619
just suddenly popped up
on the radar screen.

99
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,751
Guy Iike this was probably
in the system before.

100
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:23,195
Sexual assault, rape,
burglary, maybe a few
street holdups.

101
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:25,631
Pretty big step from there
to making four people
sodomize each other

102
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,065
and then whacking them.

103
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:28,159
What set him off, Doc?

104
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:31,603
Probably one of the victims
said or did something
to challenge his masculinity.

105
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:32,970
The sodomy
was to humiliate them.

106
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,941
Killing them was the
ultimate power trip.

107
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,739
Is this nut job
gonna hit again?

108
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,870
If he is a sadist,
he enjoyed it

109
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,778
and he'II want more.

110
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,282
Fin took your notification

111
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,716
and your boss agrees
we should be working
this case together.

112
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,651
So you're temporarily
reassigned here.

113
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,745
AII right.
That works for me.

114
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:49,221
But we got a Iittle
math problem.

115
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,690
MUNCH: Yeah?
Well, educate us.

116
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,455
Four deceased,
plus our two Iatecomers.

117
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:58,022
Look at the dining room table.
MUNCH: Seven place settings.

118
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,259
Well, maybe our
missing dinner guest

119
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:00,494
didn't Iike what
was on the menu.

120
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:01,865
We know who it is?

121
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,404
No, but Evan's father
probably does.

122
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,170
Everybody Ioved Evan.
I can't...

123
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:11,576
I can't think of a soul
who'd want to hurt him.

124
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,170
Anybody have a grudge
against you?

125
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:15,045
Oh, I doubt any
of my competitors

126
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:17,414
would resort to this
kind of mayhem.

127
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,009
As soon as you can,
we're gonna need a Iist

128
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:20,850
of everything
that was stolen.

129
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:23,982
There's some jewelry missing,
none of it's worth much.

130
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:26,152
The most valuable thing to me
was the picture.

131
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,387
What? A piece of art?

132
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:30,158
A framed photo
of Evan and me fishing.

133
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:32,896
It was hung in that
empty spot on the wall.

134
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,195
Why would he steal that?

135
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:37,466
Well, it's possible
it fell during the break-in,
and we have it in evidence.

136
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:38,938
We'II check.

137
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,335
Best we can tell,
Evan invited two couples

138
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,967
and another friend
for dinner.

139
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:45,137
But we can't account
for the single friend.

140
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:46,441
I think it was Buzzie.

141
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,742
FIN: You know Buzzie's
real name?

142
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:49,511
I'm sorry, Paul Dumont.

143
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,552
He just moved back
from Boston.

144
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:54,318
Evan and Buzzie
used to go to camp together.

145
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,448
You have any idea
how we can find him?

146
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,084
I just got him a job
over at NOHO Magazine.

147
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,991
He started two weeks ago.

148
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:02,794
Paul's not picking up.

149
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,695
You want to Ieave a message
on his voice mail?

150
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:06,734
No, we want to talk
to him in person.

151
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,735
You don't know
if he's in?

152
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:11,064
We have over 100 people
working here.

153
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,936
It's not my job
to keep track of them.

154
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,202
FIN: Is there anybody
that can help us?

155
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,709
The police are here
Iooking for Paul.

156
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,647
Sure, I'II tell them.

157
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,651
Editor is on his way out.

158
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,280
Appreciate it.

159
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:31,257
Are you the officers
Iooking for Paul Dumont?

160
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:32,418
FIN: Yes, we are.

161
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,052
I'm Ralph SIoan, the editor.

162
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,459
I just got a call
from Paul's parents.

163
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:37,555
Did something happen?

164
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,566
There was an
accident Iast night.

165
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:40,931
He's in the hospital.

166
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,526
FIN: They say which one?

167
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:45,300
Roosevelt. He's in bad shape.

168
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:49,471
EMS brought him in Iast night
with massive skull fractures.

169
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,011
DUETHORN: Was he awake
at any time?

170
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,513
Extent of his injuries,
I'm surprised he was alive.

171
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,243
We rushed him to the O.R.
to reduce the swelling
in his brain.

172
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:57,579
What are his chances?

173
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,485
Not good. A Iot of
damage and bleeding.

174
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:02,819
In my opinion,
too much for a fall.

175
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,188
Who said he fell?

176
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,318
EMS run report.
Said he was under
the influence,

177
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:07,759
found Iying on the street.

178
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,888
But it didn't scan for me.

179
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,933
FIN: I'm no doctor,
but that doesn't Iook good.

180
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,059
It's not.

181
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:15,261
Mr. Dumont
was hit in the head

182
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,304
in three places
with such force,

183
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:19,567
it caused
radiating fractures.

184
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:21,336
More consistent
with being whacked
on the head

185
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,536
with a blunt object
than with a fall.

186
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:24,771
You checked
his blood alcohol?

187
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,677
Yes, and it was zero.

188
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:28,340
He didn't have
a drop to drink.

189
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,644
MUNCH: Patrols from the 20
respond to a call for a drunk

190
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,019
in one of the stairwells
of the 79th Street
subway station.

191
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,682
They find Dumont,
all covered in blood,

192
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,989
smelling Iike he was
dragged through a wine vat.

193
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:43,121
Cops figure he tied one on,
fell down the stairs,
so they call the bus.

194
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,790
DNA put this guy
at the crime scene?

195
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:45,890
No. No, no.

196
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,798
Only blood found
belonged to the four
murder victims.

197
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,837
So he never went inside.

198
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,701
But his flowers did.

199
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,131
FIorist IDed Dumont
as the guy
who bought the flowers.

200
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,609
So we're thinking
the perp sees Dumont

201
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:57,975
going up the steps
of the Briggs place

202
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,377
with his flowers
and a bottle of wine.

203
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:02,007
Conks Dumont on the head,
throws him down the stairs.

204
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,846
Holds the flowers
Iike he's delivering them.

205
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,647
The door opens,
he goes and he does his thing.

206
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,744
Meanwhile, those whacks
on the head

207
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:07,845
Ieave Dumont disoriented

208
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,082
but not down
for the count.

209
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,182
So he somehow makes it
from the townhouse

210
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,817
all the way to
the subway station.

211
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:15,021
That's a Iong way to go
with a skull fracture.

212
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:16,961
Doctor said it's possible,
before he passed out.

213
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,226
And the wine?
Lab found stains on his coat.

214
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,860
Bottle must've broken
when he went down
and got all over him.

215
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,836
So Paul Dumont
is victim number five.

216
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,338
Crime of opportunity,
Captain.

217
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:26,464
Wrong place, wrong time.

218
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,009
Thanks. Just Iike
victims six and seven.

219
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:31,671
We got two more?
Riverside Park.

220
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,441
LAYTON: Parks Department guy
emptying the trash
found them.

221
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:35,642
Any ID?

222
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:36,877
In their wallets.

223
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,181
Russell and Darlene Weston,
both 51,

224
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:40,949
Iive a couple of blocks
up Riverside.

225
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,956
Both head-shot, naked.

226
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,326
Same as the townhouse.
Any signs of rape?

227
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:48,123
BIood on Mrs. Weston's
nether region.

228
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,390
Still waiting
for the M.E.

229
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:50,726
Your guys
find anything else?

230
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,390
Dug a spent slug
out of a tree.

231
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:53,832
Looks Iike a.380.

232
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:54,994
Rushed it to Ballistics,
waiting to see

233
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,798
if it matches
the other victims.

234
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:58,702
And check this out.

235
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:00,398
DUETHORN: Keys.

236
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,033
Belonging to one
of the victims,
I presume, right.

237
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,044
But found a couple
of yards away.

238
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:05,238
And Iook at the ring.

239
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,974
Oh, he Ieft
the keys to the house,

240
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,811
but he broke off
whatever was on the other end.

241
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,680
Maybe the keys
to the car, right.

242
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:12,276
Cash and credit cards
are gone.

243
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:13,820
LAYTON: So is their jewelry.

244
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:17,881
Got six murders in two days.
Dumont dies, that makes seven.

245
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,291
We got ourselves
a spree killer.

246
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:25,590
Add Paul Dumont
to the Ioss column.

247
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,295
Hospital called.
He died an hour ago.

248
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:29,529
Seven victims.

249
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:31,834
Except for Mr. Dumont,
they were all robbed,

250
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,897
sexually assaulted
and then shot.

251
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:36,273
Both scenes
are within 20 blocks.

252
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:38,209
This guy's killed
as many people in two days

253
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,042
as Son of Sam did
in four months.

254
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:41,843
Now you all have
your assignments,

255
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,884
Iet's get this guy.

256
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,613
Okay, how's it
going at the park?

257
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:48,053
CSU's still there,
Munch is supervising.

258
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:50,386
The slugs they found confirm
that the Westons were shot

259
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,585
with the same gun
used at the Briggs' townhouse.

260
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,718
Anything from the M.E.?

261
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:56,491
Rape kits on both victims
tested positive for fluids.

262
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,532
Doc Warner says pending DNA,

263
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,397
no stray hairs were found
other than the victims'.

264
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:01,662
So it's the same MO,

265
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:03,795
perp probably forced them
to have sex.

266
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,600
Well, Mrs. Weston
also had bruising

267
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,005
consistent with being
pistol-whipped.

268
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:09,065
Before she was shot.

269
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,872
Perp orders them to do it,
hubby says no.

270
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,436
Perp beats wifey,
threatens to kill her
unless he can get it up.

271
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:14,538
HUANG: That makes sense.

272
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:17,107
He probably beat the men
at the townhouse
for the same reason.

273
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:18,982
Okay, we got five kids
in their 20s

274
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,077
and a middle-aged couple.

275
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:21,781
This guy's making it up
as he goes along.

276
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,983
Or to him they all
have something in common.

277
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:26,185
Did we find out
what was hanging on
Mrs. Weston's key chain?

278
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,023
Family said it was
a picture of her grandson.

279
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,620
HUANG: And the photo missing
from the Briggs home?

280
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,289
Not in evidence,
so it was probably stolen.

281
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,357
Those are items that only
have value to their owners.

282
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:34,423
We thinking trophies?

283
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:36,026
Very specific trophies.

284
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:37,537
He's destroying
happy families,

285
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,266
maybe because
he's jealous.

286
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,864
I bet his own family
was miserable,

287
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,102
some kind of abuse.

288
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,370
And he's just gonna
keep taking it out

289
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:44,877
on these people
until we stop him.

290
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:47,380
EIIiot and OIivia
will run things from here.

291
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:50,383
Duethorn and Fin,
Iight a fire under CSU.

292
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:53,147
SIPER: We're combing the park
half a mile north and south,

293
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:54,916
from Riverside Drive
to the Hudson.

294
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,286
Any Iuck
besides the slug?

295
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:57,949
So far,
three distinct sets

296
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:00,586
of footwear impressions
at the murder site.

297
00:11:00,662 --> 00:11:02,823
Two sets belonging
to the victims.

298
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:05,764
The third is a work boot,
presumably the perp's.

299
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,822
This is where
he Ieft the park.

300
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,232
Toes facing towards
the sidewalk.

301
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:09,997
Dental stone'II
pick up his tracks.

302
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:12,596
He ran from the bodies
to this point.

303
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:13,663
DUETHORN: You know he ran?

304
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,140
Yeah. Check out
the foot angle.

305
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,972
When you walk,
your feet point out slightly

306
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:18,637
at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock.

307
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:20,180
But they're slightly
straighter when you run,

308
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:21,510
Iike these prints.

309
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:23,277
GEORGIE: Captain!
SIPER: What's up, Georgie?

310
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,012
More impressions.

311
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:30,254
FIat sole, athletic shoe
and work boot.

312
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,191
Get Ivan over here
with the camera.

313
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,454
Our victims
and the perp.

314
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:36,497
Toes pointing to
the murder site.

315
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:37,826
Here's your entry point.

316
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,127
I guess Mr. and Mrs. Weston

317
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,168
weren't out for a midnight
stroll in the park.

318
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:44,204
They're on the sidewalk,
they Iook Iike easy marks,

319
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:46,069
our guy forces them
to go with him.

320
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,539
Yeah. When he's done,
he Ieaves the park

321
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,735
a couple yards south
of where he came in.

322
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:51,938
He's got a thousand
places to run,

323
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:55,244
he goes back to the only place
where he could be seen. Why?

324
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,716
No parking,
8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

325
00:11:58,853 --> 00:11:59,979
Our perp's traveling by car,

326
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,282
it's perfectly Iegal
to park here.

327
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:04,222
He comes back for his ride
after he's done the deed.

328
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,317
Well, maybe somebody
in one of these buildings
parked behind him,

329
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,123
remembers the car.

330

(DOG BARKING)

331
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,498
The reason most
spree killers get caught

332
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,158
is 'cause they can't
help baiting the cops.

333
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,531
This animal's
giving us nothing.

334
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:17,298
Yeah. Neither are any
of these people.

335
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,105
How'd you get past
the doorman?

336
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,231
With this.

337
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:22,868
Detective Tutuola,
Detective Duethorn
and you are?

338
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:23,968
Renny Nix,

339
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:26,570
and you can't
barge in here Iike
you're Hawaii Five-O.

340
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:27,671
Take it easy, Mr. Nix...

341
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:29,614
When there's some guy
running around killing people.

342
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:30,878
What are you doing about that?

343
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:33,182
Seeing if anyone
in the building
saw anything.

344
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,814
Do you own a car?
No. Now get Iost.

345
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,252
You'd think
they'd be more helpful

346
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,319
instead of slamming
their doors in our faces.

347
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,261
Some people
don't Iike talking
to the cops.

348
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:45,993
Yeah, until they
need us, right?

349
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,898
How old are you?

350
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:48,993
Thirty.

351
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,061
How Iong on the job?
What, eight, nine years?

352
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,128
Five.

353
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,538
Where'd you work
before Homicide?

354
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:57,772
Patrolling the 48,
before I got my gold shield.

355
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:00,810
Only way that happens
is you collared
Osama Bin Laden

356
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,315
and I didn't get it,

357
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,510
or you got a real good
rabbi on this job.

358
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:07,053
I grew up next door
to the First Deputy
Commissioner.

359
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,986
So you parachuted
into Homicide.

360
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,183
You know what,
start in on how
I didn't earn it

361
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,557
and I'II parachute right back.
I don't need a Iecture.

362
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,096
You do the job,
you got no problems with me.

363
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,756
BRENDA: Excuse me, Officers?

364
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:18,856
Can we help you?

365
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,701
I'm sorry, my husband,
Renny Nix, was horribly
rude to you inside.

366
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,670
He said we shouldn't
get involved.

367
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,764
Did you see
something, Mrs. Nix?
Yes.

368
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,035
Last night, around midnight

369
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:30,907
I was closing the curtains
on my Iiving room window.

370
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,139
I saw a man and a woman
standing here

371
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:35,546
next to a car that was
parked right there.

372
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:38,244
Then another man
got out of
the driver's seat,

373
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,412
and walked behind them
into the park.

374
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,046
Could you see
what he Iooked Iike?

375
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:44,455
His dark winter coat,
wool cap.

376
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:45,514
I didn't see his face,

377
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,026
he walked around
the front of the car.

378
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,755
FIN: How Iong before
he came back?

379
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,297
I don't know.
I went to sleep.

380
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:51,956
Do you remember
anything about the car?

381
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:54,001
It was gold,

382
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:57,003
Iast two numbers
of the Iicense plate
were 3-5,

383
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,766
my daughter's birthday,
March 5th.

384
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,207
But I wouldn't know
a Lexus from a Lincoln.

385
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,140
Detective Shubel
from our Accident
Investigation Unit's

386
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:08,739
gonna take you through
his computer program.

387
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,545
Now we already know
the car's gold.

388
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:11,949
Were there two doors or four?

389
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,453
Four.

390
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:17,116
Did it have a trunk,
a hatchback, or a flat bed?

391
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,488
A trunk, definitely.

392
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,151
So it's a sedan.

393
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,295
Can you describe
the rear Iights?

394
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,923
Kind of oval?

395
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,129
Okay. Like this?

396
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,602
No. The Iights wrapped
around the side.

397
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,435
And the Iicense plate
was on the trunk.

398
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:36,302
Okay. How's this?

399
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:37,435
That's it!

400
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,035
Ford Contour.

401
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:45,576
Here we go. '95 Ford Contour.
Address Central Park West.

Oh, wait. There's gotta be
hundreds of them.

403
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,285
How do you know
that's the one?

404
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:50,449
This one came up as stolen.

405
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:55,590

406

have you?

Sorry, we're just
doing a follow-up.

419

Could you tell us
what happened?

420
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,490
Yeah. Sure.

421
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:32,054
About three days ago,
I go out to my plumbing
supply place in Jersey,

422
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,794
and I go to where
the car is parked,

423
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:34,926
it's not there anymore.

424

It's all in the report.

425
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,901
Are you sure you just didn't
Ieave it somewhere else?

426
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:41,134
I mean, me,
I'm always forgetting
what street I put the car on.

427
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,698
No. No. I searched
this neighborhood,

428
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,642
I'm telling you,
I even called both my boys.

429
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:46,077
I thought maybe

430
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:47,944
one of them took it
without telling me, you know?

431
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,107
You gonna get it back for me?

432
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,549
Well, it was a Ford,
so it probably wasn't
boosted for parts.

for the cabinet, you know.

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,384
So whoever boosted this,

468
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:07,723
did it the easy way,
with a key.

469
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:09,354
Or the owner dumps it
with the key in it.

470
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:12,127
Somebody else steals it,
owner collects the insurance.

471
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,225
Where are the victims?

472
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,932
CRAGEN: Adam Darling
and Craig Fischetti,
both 22.

473
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,201
Found both guys' wallets,
no cash inside.

474
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:21,299
What about jewelry?

475
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:22,570
WARNER: They both
wore wristwatches,

476
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:24,305
they have corresponding
marks on their wrists.

477
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:25,505
CRAGEN: How Iong
they been dead?

478
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,071
Six to eight hours.
They were murdered Iast night.

479
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,584
They got their clothes on.
Any signs of sexual activity?

480
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:33,018
Haven't checked yet.
But Mr. Darling's fly is open.

481
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:35,522
Yeah. Could have stopped here
to take a Ieak, you know?

482
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,057
This place is a
Iover's Iane at night.

483
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,592
These two might have been
in the middle of something

484
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,786
when the perp found them.

485
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,089
Or maybe the perp
didn't have enough time

486
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:42,323
to make them do
what he wanted.

487
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:45,025
Well, assuming
these two walked in,

488
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,499
why'd the perp
dump his ride?

489
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:49,002
My guess, he got spooked.
He could've Ieft on foot.

490
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:50,629
Or in the victim's car.

491
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:52,935
Registration in
Adam Darling's wallet.

492
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:56,136
Silver Acura,
address Tenafly, New Jersey.

493
00:17:58,613 --> 00:17:59,807
New York Police?

494
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,111
We're here about
the silver Acura SUV.

495
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:05,679
My son Adam
borrowed it Iast night

496
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,085
and we haven't
heard from him.

497
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,287
Are he and Craig
and the girls okay?

498
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,452
What girls?

499
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,928
DUETHORN: Names are
CIaudia Smullen
and Diane Combs,

500
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,557
both 21,
roommates at Barnard.

501
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:21,067
Double-dating with our
two male victims.

502
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:23,104
We grid-searched the park,
checked their apartment,

503
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:25,435
and called their parents.
These girls are in the wind.

504
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:28,135
Let's get alerts out
on all their credit cards
and bank accounts

505
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,734
in case somebody's using them.

506
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,836
How are we doing
on those phone tips, John?

507
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,278
Do you remember
that white van
everybody saw

508
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:34,679
during the DC
sniper shootings?

509
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,512
Well, our man is a plumber,

510
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,179
garbage man, doorman,
husband.

511
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:40,243
The city's out of control.

512
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:42,313
Ballistics says
it's the same gun.

513
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,721
Nine dead, two missing.

514
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,623
This guy's killed every one
of his victims so far,

515
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:47,286
why snatch these two women?

516
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:50,024
They're Iiving trophies
and I think he's stashing
them somewhere.

517
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:51,292
So what's changed?

518
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:52,390
HUANG: His confidence.

519
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,765
He used the victims
as surrogates
to rape each other.

520
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,929
Maybe he's ready to rape
the women himself now.

521
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,905
This guy's MO's
all over the map.

522
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,464
But we still do have
some constants.

523
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:01,531
The gun, for one thing.

524
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,271
His comfort zone,
the Upper West Side.

525
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:04,778
He Iikes
controlled environments,

526
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:07,007
the townhouses,
secluded areas of parks.

527
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:08,481
And he targets couples.

528
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,518
A woman or a man
walking alone

529
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:11,984
Iate at night,
they're vigilant.

530
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:13,247
But two people walking together,

531
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,686
they don't always
perceive the danger.

532
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:17,054
Guy's an animal hunting
the slowest prey in the herd.

533
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,753
Or a Ioner who has trouble
making social connections.

534
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:22,592
So people in
successful relationships
trigger his rage.

535
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,222
Because they have
what he never will.

536
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,130
And maybe kidnapping
these two women

537
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:27,668
is his way
to fulfill his fantasy.

538
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:30,034
BENSON: Assuming that
they're not already dead.

539
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:31,367
How much time do we have?

540
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,701
When he's done
or when one of these women

541
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:34,401
pisses him off,
he's gonna kill them.

542
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:35,602
STABLER: Maybe we
just caught a break.

543
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:38,339
Lab got something
out of the Contour.

544
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:41,038
No blood,
no prints matching anyone
in the system,

545
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:44,085
no fibers connecting
any of the victims
to the Contour.

546
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:45,551
But we did
find footprints

547
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,713
consistent with all
of the crime scenes.

548
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,518
So we can estimate his height.

549
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:50,956
EIeven-and-a-half
inch impressions

550
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:52,186
means the perp's shoe size

551
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,285
is between eight
and nine-and-a-half.

552
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:56,388
So our guy is
between 5'5" and 5'10".

553
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:58,262
And, he's wearing these.

554
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:01,030
OutdoorWear Explorers.

555
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:04,300
Very expensive.
But great treads
for trace evidence.

556
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:08,673
Which we found in the car
and in his boot impressions.

557
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:12,976
Wood?
Pine, oak and cherry.

558
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,449
The tube next to it
has fiberglass insulation.

559
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:17,611
Sounds Iike we're
after someone who works
in construction.

560
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,281
That's what I thought
until I found the rest.

561
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,618
DUETHORN: What is this?
Grass seed?

562
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,923
Two different blends.

563
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:29,863
Rye and Kentucky bluegrass.
Suburban boy?

564
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,326
Yonkers,
but even my old man

565
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,266
never made me seed
the Iawn in the
middle of winter.

566
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:36,237
Well, I doubt it came
from the park.

567
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:40,036
There were also
traces of diazinon,
a common pesticide,

568
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:43,101
ammonium nitrate and Iime,
both used for fertilizer,

569
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:46,171
and some metal shavings,
bronze and brass.

570
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:47,409
From what?

571
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:49,917
I'd say a
key-cutting machine.

572
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:54,646
So he had key shavings, wood,
insulation and bug killer.

573
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:56,419
AII the stuff
a building super uses.

574
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:58,983
Except for the grass seed
and the fertilizer.

575
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:00,688
We're Iooking for someone
who works around

576
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:03,129
these materials every day.

577
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,461
DUETHORN: The only place
you can find all that stuff

578
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:07,798
is in a home
improvement store.

579
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,394
AII right,
send a flatbed and a team

580
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:12,669
and make sure
nobody touches it
before it gets here.

581
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:13,902
What's up, Captain?

582
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:16,035
Your silver SUV
just turned up.

583
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:18,080
With somebody sleeping inside.

584
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:22,980
Anti-Crime found the SUV
parked on 49th
between 8th and 9th.

585
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:25,043
I managed to get
a description from a drunk

586
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,486
who was sitting in
the back seat of the car.

587
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:28,523
Young, average height,
dark hair, blue eyes.

588
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,058
Great. So he Iooks Iike
a million other people.

589
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:32,754
Yeah, but most of them
don't work in a home
improvement store.

590
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:35,661
And we're gonna have to
canvass every single one
of them that sell Iumber.

591
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,892
That's the only
solid Iead we have.

592
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:43,727
He's about 5'9",
dark hair, blue eyes.

593
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:47,936
We have several employees
who fit that description.

594
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,910
Hari Singh,
Andy Regal,

595
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:51,970
Butch Lanahan,
Billy Baker...

596
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:53,208
Billy Baker?
Yeah.

597
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:55,307
Works 4:00 to 11:00
in the Iumber department.

598
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:56,681
He Iives over
on Central Park West?

599
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:57,912
Yeah.

600
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:00,956
Seems funny someone
with that address
would work here.

601
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:02,991
I can't imagine him
being in any kind of trouble.

602
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,687
Yeah. Why's that?
He's a boss's dream.

603
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:07,228
Does whatever
you tell him to,
never complains.

604
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,991
Worked here three years,
only Iate once.

605
00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:10,896
FIN: When?
Other day.

606
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:12,058
Said his car was stolen.

607
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:15,861
The Contour was never boosted.
Billy just took it.

608
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,099
Yeah, and Billy knows
we're asking
questions about it,

609
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:20,665
he figures it's too hot,
dumps it in Central Park.

610
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,802
CRAGEN: Explains why
the steering column
was clean.

611
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:25,506
That quiet Iittle guy
was a time bomb
waiting to explode?

612
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:26,980
Billy's the super's kid.

613
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:28,346
He grew up surrounded
by rich people

614
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:29,975
who probably treated
him Iike dirt.

615
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:32,680
And every one of our victims
is wealthy or appeared to be.

616
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:33,881
And now he's getting
back at them.

617
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:35,719
We picking him up,
Captain?

618
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,019
Doc?

619
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:38,458
It's an all-power game.

620
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:40,017
Arrest him now,
he may never tell us

621
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:41,859
where these missing women are.

622
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:43,865
CRAGEN: Then we sit on him
to make sure
he doesn't kill again

623
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,594
and hope he Ieads us
to the victims.

624
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:48,034
Three teams,
three shifts, 24/7.

625
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:49,799
CSU is done with the Contour,

626
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:51,169
Iet's get it back
to the Bakers.

627
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,571
Unless he stole another car,

628
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:55,508
Billy's gonna need
some transportation.

629
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:58,973
FIN: How you read that trash?

630
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:01,175
I got an inquiring mind.

631
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,718
You get off on that
psych stuff, don't you?

632
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:06,550
Average murder's
one drug dealer
shooting another,

633
00:23:06,622 --> 00:23:08,886
a bar fight
or a domestic gone bad.

634
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,516
Once you figure out the who,

635
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:13,494
working Homicide's all about
where the perps are
and finding them.

636
00:23:13,562 --> 00:23:15,120
So?

637
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:17,665
Sex crime is about the why.

638
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:21,863
This city's
a three-ring circus
and SVU's the freak show.

639
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:25,840
And you wanna be
the ringmaster.

640
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:27,967
I wanna know
what makes them freaks.

641
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:35,243
Here it comes.

642
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,511
FIN: It's the Contour.

643
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:38,678
Okay, kiddies,
car's on the move.

644
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:39,812
Billy's driving.

645
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,717
South on Columbus.
Our boy's behind the wheel.

646
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:51,188
Comes all the way
down here to get cash?

647
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:53,758
He could have done that
on Columbus Avenue.

648
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,071
DUETHORN: Look at that.

649
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,300
Do you know anyone
that needs a cheat sheet

650
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,569
to remember a PIN number?

651
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:02,804
Only when it
ain't their card.

652
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:04,140
SVU detail to base,

653
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:06,841
subject appears to be
using a stolen ATM card.

654
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,117
If he's got the PIN number,
they could still be alive.

655
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:12,882
CRAGEN: Take him.
FIN: 10-4.

656
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:16,917
We're taking him.
Nice and easy,
may have a gun.

657
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,335
Police officers, stop!

658
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:40,208
BILLY: No, no.
Get off of me, please.

659
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:42,746
PIease!

660
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:44,985
That what you did,
Billy? Huh?
FIN: Dave!

661
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:46,988
Huh? Is that what you did?
You made them
plead for their Iives?

662
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:48,455
Before you blew
their heads off?
Come on. Ease off.

663
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:50,287
Is that what you did? Huh?
Dave! Easy! Easy!

664
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,826
Crying Iike a Iittle girl.
Where are they?

665
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:53,054
Don't you move.
Where are they?

666
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:54,356
Where are the girls?
Dave!

667
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,227
Where are the girls?
Dave!

668
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:01,663
(BILLY GRUNTS)

669
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:06,138
The ATM card will be enough
to get a warrant
to search his crib.

670
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:12,904
CRAGEN: Anything?
If it's here it's well-hidden.

671
00:25:12,982 --> 00:25:14,313
You guys are making
a big mistake.

672
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,941
Billy wouldn't do
something Iike this.

673
00:25:16,018 --> 00:25:17,679
Our evidence says he did.

674
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:19,380
Billy have access
to anywhere else
in the building?

675
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:22,219
Yes. Everywhere.
I keep all the master keys
in my office.

676
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,452
Billy's been hanging out
in the basement a Iot Iately.

677
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:25,926
What's down there?

678
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:28,623
Boiler room, Iaundry,
owner's storage Iockers.

679
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:30,028
You got keys
to those, too?

680
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,430
AL: Yes, sir. I do.

681
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,900
Don't you need, Iike,
a warrant or something?

682
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,494
Not if we have
the owner's consent.

683
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:42,172
Over here.
What have you got?

684
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:45,780
CRAGEN: Evan
and Earl Briggs.

685
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:50,174
MUNCH: Mrs. Weston's
grandson from
her key chain.

686
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,588
Melissa Ziman's
engagement ring.

687
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:56,617
And one pair of
OutdoorWear work boots.

688
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:01,797
DUETHORN: Game's up, Billy.
We got you cold.

689
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:05,835
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Save it, Billy.

690
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:07,233
I don't wanna hear
how you didn't do it,

691
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:09,397
it wasn't you,
you were abused
as a child.

692
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:11,599
We have the boots.
Look at them.

693
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:13,802
They match prints
at all the crime scenes

694
00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:15,003
and in your father's car.

695
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:16,739
What, you can't stand
the sight of them, Billy?

696
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:19,611
Look at them, Billy.
They're your boots.
Look at them.

697
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:21,742
(SOBBING)
Why are you picking on me?

698
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:23,583
I told you I didn't do it.

699
00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:26,087
Then explain this stuff!
You know what this is?

700
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:28,420
This is your one-way ticket
to a Iethal injection.

701
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:30,152
But you got
a chance here, Billy.

702
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:31,625
What chance?

703
00:26:31,695 --> 00:26:33,890
Tell us where these women are.

704
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:36,159
The DA'II spare you
the death penalty.

705
00:26:36,232 --> 00:26:38,996
They die and it's all
over for you.

706
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:43,798
The story doesn't have to
end that way though.

707
00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:45,602
Look at me.

708
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:48,803
Don't blow this,
it's your only shot.

709
00:26:55,552 --> 00:26:57,042
I wanna talk to my brother.

710
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,146
DUETHORN: You gotta show us
some good faith here first.

711
00:27:01,157 --> 00:27:02,920
Where are the women?

712
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:06,155
I'II tell you
whatever you want.

713
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:09,198
Just Iet me talk
to Charlie first.

714
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,125
Two hours,
it's the first time
he's cracked.

715
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:14,727
Brother goes in
and tells Billy to Iawyer up,
we're screwed.

716
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:16,601
Doesn't matter,
the case is already
bulletproof

717
00:27:16,673 --> 00:27:17,765
without Billy's confession.

718
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:19,308
Our priority is
finding those women.

719
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,775
They've been missing
for 24 hours.

720
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:22,812
We gotta
take the risk.

721
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:27,339
Charlie goes for it,
I want both of you and Huang
Iistening to every word.

722
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:30,346
Maybe I should call a Iawyer?

723
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,980
No Iawyer in the world's
gonna be able
to help him out of this.

724
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:34,250
His only chance
to stay alive

725
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:35,916
is to tell us where
those women are.

726
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:38,927
He's right, Dad.
We have to save his Iife.

727
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:41,088
Look, you sure
you know what you're doing?

728
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:43,758
Yeah.
Let me talk to him.

729
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,666
Billy...

730
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:51,138
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

731
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:54,803
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

732
00:27:56,012 --> 00:27:57,809
I screwed up.

733
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:00,044
Are you mad at me?

734
00:28:00,116 --> 00:28:02,380
No, you're my brother.

735
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:09,154
But you and me,
we gotta work this out.

736
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:12,458
How?

737
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:17,861
The cops want you to show them
where these women are.

738
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:23,434
No, I won't do it.

739
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:31,980
You have to do
the right thing here, Billy.

740
00:28:32,048 --> 00:28:33,481
You have to be strong.

741
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:38,083
You have to be a man.

742
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:40,147
I am.

743
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:43,187
Can't you see that?

744
00:28:51,034 --> 00:28:55,334
No matter what happens
I'm always here for you.

745
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:58,674
You understand?

746
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,507
I Iove you, Charlie.

747
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:04,846
I love you,
too, Billy.

748
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:07,776
He's not gonna
tell us a damn thing.

749
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:10,445
Lied so he could
see his brother.
Anything, Doc?

750
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,613
Nothing, except Billy never
asked for his father.

751
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:14,782
Well, Charlie's sober.
Dad isn't.

752
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,318
Sorry, Detectives.

753
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:20,624
Thanks for trying.
Your father's outside.

754
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:27,797
He didn't give up
anything, Captain.

755
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:28,929
We're heading back in.

756
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:31,235
Forget it.
We got two more bodies.

757
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:32,365
Greenwich Village.

758
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:35,770
That's way out
of his comfort zone.

759
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,308
What's going on?

760
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:45,278
Iris and Daniel Braverman.
Mid-20s. Found by their maid.

761
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:47,550
Iris was shot once,
execution-style.

762
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:49,182
Husband's another story.

763
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,652
(GROANS)

764
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:51,989
Man, this guy's face
is gone.

765
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,325
Found some stippling
on what skin was Ieft.

766
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:56,194
Shooter put the gun
right between his eyes.

767
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:57,893
As if he wanted him
to see it coming.

768
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,298
Was Mrs. Braverman raped?

769
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:01,166
Yes. But no fluids
on the husband.

770
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:03,068
Which means our guy
did the deed himself.

771
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:04,197
How Iong they dead?

772
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:06,435
They're not in rigor yet.
Less than six hours.

773
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:07,703
DUETHORN: Rules out Billy.

774
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:09,369
He's been in custody
all night.

775
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:10,935
Okay. The perp empties
a whole clip

776
00:30:11,014 --> 00:30:12,709
into this guy's face
point-blank

777
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:14,443
then rapes
the wife, himself.

778
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:15,882
It's way off the MO.

779
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:17,078
It could be a copycat.

780
00:30:17,153 --> 00:30:19,121
Or Billy had a partner.

781
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:21,282
Whoever it is,
this is personal.

782
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:22,688
We need to check
these victims'
backgrounds

783
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,420
as quickly as possible.

784
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:26,689
And get the ballistics.

785
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:29,027
The Bravermans
have been in the same
address for two years.

786
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:30,190
Before that, college.

787
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,257
Before that, Daniel
Iived with his parents,

788
00:30:32,335 --> 00:30:33,962
same address as Billy Baker.

789
00:30:34,037 --> 00:30:35,026
How Iong?

790
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:36,662
Their whole Iife.
Grew up there.

791
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:38,468
With Billy
and his brother.

792
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:41,305
I got it! I got it.
Guess what?

793
00:30:41,377 --> 00:30:43,811
It's the same gun.
It's the same gun.

794
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,041
But guess what.
CRAGEN: What?

795
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:48,015
It's two perps.
How do we know that?

796
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:50,951
The footprints. AII right.
This one we found
in Riverside Park, right?

797
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,248
This one we found
in Central Park

798
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:53,346
where the women
were snatched.

799
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:56,415
Two right foot prints,
same boot, same size.

800
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:58,357
This one,
this guy walks normally.

801
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:01,022
And then this one,
with the smudge,
we found four of them,

802
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:03,190
one right in front
of the next.

803
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,927
This is our second perp
and this guy,

804
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,096
he walks with a Iimp.

805
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:09,365
Just Iike Charlie.

806
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:12,704
HUANG: That song-and-dance
in interrogation
was all an act.

807
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:14,834
Charlie was telling Billy
to keep his mouth shut.

808
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:17,209
Charlie's the dominant one.
He's the one
calling the shots.

809
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,043
We gotta pick him up.
Go easy.

810
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:20,878
He knows we're onto him,
he's Iiable to kill the women

811
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,646
if he hasn't already.

812
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,415
Charlie's gone.
Where?

813
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:27,183
I don't know.
He at work?

814
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:28,281
No.

815
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:29,450
They called here
Iooking for him.

816
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:31,049
But they said
he never showed up.

817
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:33,425
When's the Iast time
you seen him?

818
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:35,794
Was when we Ieft
the police station.

819
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:37,662
Got any idea
where he may have gone?

820
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:39,634
Why, you think
he'd tell me?

821
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:43,160
Let me guess,
he's in trouble now,
too, huh?

822
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:44,399
DUETHORN: You don't even
sound surprised.

823
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:47,568
No. Because if Billy did
what you think Billy did,

824
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:49,111
Charlie must've had
something to do with it.

825
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:50,202
Why do you say that?

826
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,248
Because Billy
can't do anything

827
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:53,475
without somebody
telling him to.

828
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:55,813
This kid has never
made a decision

829
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:57,409
in his whole Iife
on his own, you know?

830
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,045
Lets the whole world
push him around.

831
00:31:59,122 --> 00:32:00,487
Listen!
Hey, hey, hey.

832
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:02,547
We got two women missing
and I don't have
a Iot of time!

833
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,150
Okay. Okay. Just don't hit me.

834
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:08,290
Just... Just don't hit.

835
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:10,093
AII right. AII right.
We got it.

836
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:13,600
Does anyone
besides his brother
know where Charlie is?

837
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,659
Yeah. Yeah. His girlfriend.

838
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:17,399
He and that slut
work together.

839
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:24,576
MARIE: I have no idea
where Charlie is.

840
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,114
Why are you asking me?

841
00:32:26,182 --> 00:32:28,548
Well, because
you're his girlfriend.

842
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:31,815
I was his girlfriend.
I dumped him six months ago.

843
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:35,382
He's crazy.
He and that brother of his.

844
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:37,189
You know Billy?

845
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,093
Yeah. Too well.

846
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,755
And that was kind of
the problem.

847
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,998
You had sex
with your boyfriend's brother?

848
00:32:48,338 --> 00:32:51,603
Billy was a Iittle fast,
but cute.

849
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:54,768
I didn't really mind
when Charlie told me
to break him in.

850
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:56,835
And you did everything
Charlie told you to do?

851
00:32:56,913 --> 00:33:00,474
I thought I Ioved him.
Until the Iast time.

852
00:33:01,317 --> 00:33:02,841
What happened?

853
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:07,282
Charlie climbed into bed
with me and Billy.

854
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:08,381
You had a threesome?

855
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,482
Yeah.

856
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,959
Until it became a twosome.
And I wasn't one of the two.

857
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:21,830
Charlie and Billy?

858
00:33:21,904 --> 00:33:22,928
Yeah.

859
00:33:24,374 --> 00:33:28,435
Billy didn't really want to,
but Charlie made him.

860
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,644
Billy was crying so Ioud

861
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:34,182
that their daddy came back
and caught us.

862
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:37,785
Charlie threatened to kill me,

863
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:41,017
Billy and their father
if we ever told anybody.

864
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,294
What'd those officers
bring me here for, huh?

865
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:57,498
I told you
I don't know anything.

866
00:33:57,573 --> 00:33:59,040
Mr. Baker, how did you
hurt yourself?

867
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:00,735
I'm a building super.
It happens.

868
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,970
FIN: You're pretty
accident-prone.

869
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:03,069
I had a bad week.

870
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:04,272
Yeah. Is that why
you been drinking?

871
00:34:04,347 --> 00:34:06,212
So I take a pop
every now and then, so what?

872
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:08,773
FIN: You reek of booze.
You're drunk!
Hey, hey! Come on!

873
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:10,785
I said just,
just don't hit me, okay?

874
00:34:10,853 --> 00:34:13,720
Just don't, don't hit me.

875
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:16,014
I'm not trying to hurt you.
Come on.

876
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:18,253
I'm trying to help you.
Get up.

877
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:29,163
HUANG: Who's been
beating you, AI?

878
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:30,466
Nobody.

879
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:32,932
Was it Charlie?
No.

880
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:36,839
But you caught Charlie
having sex with Billy,
didn't you?

881
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:45,211
AI?

882
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:52,318
Yeah. He was raping Billy.

883
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:54,428
And you tried
to stop him.

884
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:56,192
I told him to Ieave him alone.

885
00:34:56,265 --> 00:34:57,698
He just Iaughed at me.

886
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,236
He said I was a drunken Ioser.

887
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:03,704
He said I couldn't
keep a woman.

888
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:06,004
He told me he was gonna do
whatever he wanted to do.

889
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:08,236
So I tried to
pull him off Billy,

890
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:09,710
he just pushed me away.

891
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:11,076
AII right and then
what happened?

892
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:13,206
Then I called him a faggot.

893
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:16,948
So he hit me. Boy.

894
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:21,579
My kid hit me,
again, and again, and again.

895
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:24,584
Now he hits me every day.

896
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:27,126
Did Billy beat you, too?

897
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:28,493
No.

898
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:31,362
Never. Billy would never
do that. He's a sweet kid.

899
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:34,460
Wouldn't hurt a fly
unless Charlie told him to.

900
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:38,064
Billy's a good, good kid.

901
00:35:38,141 --> 00:35:39,631
Billy didn't put
that stuff in that Iocker

902
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:41,609
from those poor people.
Charlie did it.

903
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:44,043
Charlie got the key
and Charlie stole

904
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:46,581
every time he could
from all those residents.

905
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,844
Said I was gonna Iose my job
if I told anybody.

906
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:53,483
Did you help Charlie
hide those women?

907
00:35:53,556 --> 00:35:55,786
No. I swear I didn't.

908
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:56,950
HUANG: AI?

909
00:35:57,593 --> 00:35:59,424
We need to find them.

910
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:03,264
Yeah. I know.

911
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:05,232
FIN: Are you hiding Charlie?

912
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:11,470
Boy, you guys
don't understand.

913
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,701
He's gonna kill me.

914
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:18,003
He's not gonna ever be able
to hurt you again.

915
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:21,447
If you don't tell us
where he is
and those women die,

916
00:36:21,517 --> 00:36:22,779
that's on you.

917
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:35,554
He's in an apartment
in my building.

918
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:38,890
One of the residents
is on vacation.

You told them where I was!
You bastard! I'II kill you!

00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:08,858
I should have killed you
for what you did to Billy.

would all be dead.

931
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:24,911
Then us, then your dad,
then you'd do yourself?

932
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:26,915
Not today, Charlie.

933
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:28,382
Come on.

934
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,679
You're never gonna
find those bitches.

935
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:34,154
They're gonna die

936
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:36,020
and you're never
gonna find them.

937
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:44,262
Where are they?

938
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,301
How many times
you gonna ask me
the same stupid question?

939
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,428
As many times as it takes!
Where are they?

940
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:51,132
You're wasting your breath
because I'm not gonna
tell you a damn thing.

941
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:53,675
Give it up, Charlie!
Your father
told us everything!

942
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:55,438
My father doesn't
know dick.

943
00:37:55,511 --> 00:37:57,945
Yeah? He saw you
rape your brother.

944
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,778
He doesn't know what he saw.
He's a drunken Ioser.

945
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,908
That why you beat him?

946
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,383
Because he caught you
screwing your brother

947
00:38:03,452 --> 00:38:04,919
and he called you a fag?

948
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:07,114
Your ex-girlfriend, Marie,
said that right foot of yours

949
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:08,816
ain't the only thing
that's Iimp.

950
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:11,416
But you can make it happen
with your own brother,
ain't that right, Charlie?

951
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:12,518
Yeah. That why
you raped him?

952
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:13,527
That's why
you got that gun

953
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:16,326
to show everybody
you're a man.

954
00:38:18,668 --> 00:38:21,694
You think you guys
are better than me?

955
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:22,897
You think you're Iike
all those rich people?

956
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:24,769
You think you can push me
around Iike they did?

957
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,330
Is that what this
is all about?

958
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:28,400
You're damn right it is!

959
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:31,139
And I showed them!
Yeah.

960
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:32,805
You showed them.

961
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:35,709
Now tell us where they are!

962
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:45,716
If you're so smart,
go find them yourself.

963
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:48,025
Look at that...
Look at that door,
pretty boy.

964
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:49,758
Look at that door.

965
00:38:54,437 --> 00:38:56,905
You think this
is gonna work, huh?

966
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:05,812
Billy, you have to
tell them.

967
00:39:07,817 --> 00:39:10,752
No. Take me
back to jail.

968
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,946
I tried, Son.

969
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:14,683
I did. I tried to
protect you from him.

970
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:16,622
So I could grow up
to be Iike you?

971
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:21,225
Charlie is twice the man
you'II ever be.

972
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:31,096
FIN: Charlie set
you up, Billy.

973
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,007
What are you
talking about?

974
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:35,338
Know all that
stuff you stole

975
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:36,469
from the people
you murdered,

976
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:37,705
and the boots you wore,

977
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,543
you know where
we found them?

978
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:42,209
In a storage Iocker
in your building.

979
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:50,723
Don't tell them
anything, Billy.

980
00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:56,356
That's not where
we hid those things, Charlie.

981
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,291
Why'd you put them there?

982
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:01,393
Because he was gonna make you
take the rap all by yourself.

983
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,960
No, I wasn't.

984
00:40:03,038 --> 00:40:04,369
It's not true, Billy.

985
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,135
It is true.
He stole the keys.

986
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,142
He betrayed you, Billy.

987
00:40:11,781 --> 00:40:13,112
He would never do that.

988
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:14,649
AL: He's no good.

989
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:17,686
I may not be much,
but I never Iied to you, Son.

990
00:40:17,753 --> 00:40:20,654
I never sold you out.
He sold you out.

991
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:22,551
BILLY: No.

992
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,256
Only your boots
were there, Billy.
Not Charlie's.

993
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:32,693
Why did you do that?

994
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,201
Be a man, Billy.

995
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,601
Don't tell them
where those bitches are!

996
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:36,865
Why didn't you protect me?

997
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:37,997
Shut up!

998
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:40,940
You said it was us
against everyone else!

999
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:45,107
And you Iied to me.
You're a Iiar!
You Iittle wimp!

1000
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:48,275
I'II rip you apart
if you tell them anything!

1001
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:52,410
Charlie made me
kill those people!

1002
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:53,546
Shut the hell up!

1003
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:55,351
But he shot those
women's boyfriends!
Shut up!

1004
00:40:55,424 --> 00:40:56,857
Where are they, Billy?
Where are the women?

1005
00:40:56,926 --> 00:40:59,451
CHARLIE: No!
Don't tell them anything!

1006
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:00,654
They're on the roof!

1007
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:02,196
You stupid son of a bitch.

1008
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:04,095
What roof? What roof?
Shut up!

1009
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,930
Of our building.
In the old water tower.

1010
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:18,076
(PEOPLE CHATTERING ON RADIO)

1011
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:19,808
How are they?

1012
00:41:19,882 --> 00:41:21,281
PARAMEDIC:
They'II be all right.

1013
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,181
They're frostbitten.
Got her.

1014
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:25,550
They wouldn't have
Iasted another night.

1015
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:26,986
Any signs
of sexual assault?

1016
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:28,785
Not that
we can see.

1017
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:31,952
Won't be sure
until we get them
to the hospital.

1018
00:41:36,198 --> 00:41:38,063
You're gonna be okay.

1019
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:44,267
What now?

1020
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,071
Go to the hospital,
take their statements,
get some sleep.
