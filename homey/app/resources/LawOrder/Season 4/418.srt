1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:04,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:05,998
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:09,009
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:12,638
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,375
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:17,210
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

8
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:20,083
PIease, honey,
open the door.

9
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:22,715
You can do it.
Come on.

10
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,718
Hurry. Hurry, there's
a Iittle kid trapped in there
and he can't reach the knob.

11
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,922
What's his name?
Mikey.

12
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:33,332
Mikey, fire department.
Can you hear me?

13
00:00:33,402 --> 00:00:36,599
Mikey,
I need you to stand
away from the door.

14
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,731
Get as far back
as you can, okay?

15
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:41,173
Take the door, guys.

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:42,674
Hit it.

17
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,375
You take the back.
I'II take the front.

18
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,712
10-26,
food on the stove.

19
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:51,946
FIREFIGHTER:
Roger that, 10-26.

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,146
We're clear.

21
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:56,054
Mikey? Mikey,
where are you?

22
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:58,983
Mikey?

23
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:04,832
The kid's injured.
Come on. Let's get you
out of here.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,592
FIREFIGHTER 2: Over here.
She's barely breathing.

25
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:07,999
I got him.

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,538
10-45. Code 2.
Start out a bus.

27
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:12,698
DISPATCHER: 10-4.
Bus is on the way.

28
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,608
The mother's critical.
Major head trauma.

29
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:20,078
CT shows multiple
subdural hematomas.

30
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:22,981
She gonna make it?
It's hard to say.
She's in surgery right now.

31
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:24,109
And the sexual assault?

32
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:26,677
Genital trauma shows
she was raped
and sodomized.

33
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,586
We didn't find
any fluids.

34
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:30,147
How's the boy?
Hmm.

35
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:31,782
No physical injuries.

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,192
AII the blood
on Mikey
was his mom's.

37
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:36,457
He may have seen it.
You mind
if I talk to him?

38
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:37,998
No. Go ahead.

39
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:40,930
Mikey?

40
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:45,932
My name is OIivia.
How old are you?

41
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:50,670
Six?

42
00:01:56,651 --> 00:02:00,712
Mikey, I need to talk to you
about what happened
in the apartment.

43
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,756
Did you see your
mommy get hurt?

44
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,288
Can you tell me
about it?

45
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,511
That's right, honey,
I'm a police officer.

46
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:28,309
And I need your help
to find the person
who hurt your mom.

47
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,380
OIivia.

48
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,956
I'II be back in
a Iittle while, okay?

49
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:45,161
This is gonna take
some time.

50
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,066
Maybe once
he sees his mother.
She just died.

51
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,283
Anything on
next of kin?

52
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:42,846
Well, no handbag,
no wallet.

53
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:45,518
Perp took everything
he could. And this guy's
very careful.

54
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:48,154
So far, no prints,
no semen, no hair.

55
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,458
Why target
this apartment?

56
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:50,555
Easy access.

57
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:54,295
Ground floor, no gates,
the Iocks are
a piece of crap.

58
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:57,463
From the tool marks,
I'd say he forced the Iock
with a screwdriver.

59
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,938
The victim is
on her back.

60
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:00,269
He gets on the bed,
straddles her.

61
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:01,400
She struggles.

62
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:03,034
He grabs this Iamp
from that table.

63
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,635
Knocks her out
with two blows.

64
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,180
Our victim's face
was a mess.

65
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,781
Are you sure that
he only hit her twice?

66
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:08,941
BIood doesn't Iie.

67
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,212
See that single
Iine on the ceiling?
BENSON: Yeah.

68
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:13,914
First blow
starts the blood flow,
second makes that pattern.

69
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,082
After the rape,
he beats her some more,
but it's overkill.

70
00:04:16,157 --> 00:04:17,590
She's already
unconscious.

71
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:18,683
Well, how'd you get that?

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,558
BIood spatter
on the sofa back
is concentrated in one area.

73
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,257
Doesn't Iook Iike
she moved
to evade the blows.

74
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,629
AII the damage
was to her face.
This feels personal.

75
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,191
Maybe it's not
some random break-in
we're Iooking at.

76
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,999
If she was
knocked out during
the sexual assault,

77
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,732
maybe Mikey
slept through it.

78
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,899
I don't think so.
See the handprints?

79
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:37,035
Well, maybe Mikey
tried to wake Mommy up,
he got his hand in the blood.

80
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,012
Could've happened
after the perp Ieft.

81
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,105
Possible, but
see the urine stain.

82
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,681
Boy hid
in the doorway,
watching.

83
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:46,243
What he saw
scared him so much,
he wet his pants.

84
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:49,256
So if Mikey woke up,
maybe somebody else did.

85
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,151
The walls are paper thin,
but I didn't hear nothing.

86
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,354
Smoke woke me up.

87
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:57,125
We're trying
to Iocate
family members.

88
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,359
What can you
tell us about
Mikey and his mom?

89
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:02,767
Said her name was Dana,
didn't give me
the family tree.

90
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,498
Moved in a month ago.

91
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,938
Dana have any visitors,
maybe a boyfriend?

92
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,738
I didn't see nobody
except her and the boy.

93
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,779
Well, did she ever say
anything about family,

94
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,814
maybe mention where
they used to Iive?

95
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:15,076
The Iandlord might know.

96
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,310
Good. He around?

97
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,375
That bastard only
comes to collect the rent.

98
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:20,648
He's got an office
in midtown.

99
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:24,117
I bet you it's
a hell of a Iot nicer
than this dump.

100
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:27,127
Apartment 1-H.
That would be, uh,
Dana McGuire.

101
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:30,323
Okay. We'II need the rental
application, credit report,
any other papers.

102
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:31,990
Sorry, my secretary
called in sick.

103
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,760
I don't know where
she keeps those files.

104
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,360
A Iandlord who
can't find a Iease?
Hey, I'm a busy man.

105
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:39,271
I got better things
to do than Iisten to
a cop crack wise.

106
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:40,638
I've got calls to make.

107
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,176
I'II have her
get in touch.

108
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:45,572
Friend of mine at
the D.A.'s office
Ioves to prosecute slumlords.

109
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,842
Last guy,
got sentenced
to six months

110
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,180
Iiving in his own
condemned building.

111
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:54,378
Look, I don't have
any paper on her.
It was off the books.

112
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:56,754
Lady paid cash up
front for three months.

113
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:59,419
Which we'II be glad
to pass on to the IRS,
in case you forgot.

114
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:00,927
Hey, I'm trying
to be helpful here.

115
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:03,520
STABLER: So far,
you're coming up short.

116
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:07,466
Okay. Wait a minute.
Um, she showed me
her driver's Iicense.

117
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:10,095
Address was on
Central Park West,
300 block.

118
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:11,832
Your memory's
a Iittle convenient.

119
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:14,067
Names I'm not so good at,

120
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:17,441
but I never forget
a prime piece
of real estate.

121
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,009
(DOOR OPENING)

122
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:23,744
Can I help you?
Yeah. NYPD,
good afternoon.

123
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,513
Wondering if you
know a, uh, Dana McGuire?

124
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:28,146
Of course I do.
I'm her husband.

125
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,521
Mr. McGuire,
when was the Iast time
you saw your wife?

126
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:32,389
About five minutes ago.

127
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:34,324
She's inside,
feeding the baby.

128
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,294
A dead woman
was using my ID?

129
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:40,129
That's so creepy.

130
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,294
Any idea how
she got a hold of
your driver's Iicense?

131
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,066
Uh, I was mugged
on my way back
from Mommy & Me class.

132
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,109
In broad daylight
on Columbus Avenue.
Not a cop in sight.

133
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:49,905
Mrs. McGuire,
did you report
the robbery?

134
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:51,070
Yeah, a Iot of good it did.

135
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:53,137
Honey, they're just
trying to help.

136
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:56,615
They caught the guy
maxing out my
credit cards at Macy's.

137
00:06:56,684 --> 00:07:00,745
D.A. plea-bargained
the case. He only got
six months at Rikers.

138
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:03,985
Those yuppie moms,
pushing their strollers,

139
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:07,323
carrying diaper bags,
yoga mats and crap.

140
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,894
Easy pickings.

141
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:11,090
I checked your booking sheet.

142
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,690
Dana McGuire's
driver's Iicense

143
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,257
was not on you when
you were collared.

144
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:17,600
What are you smoking?
No way I'm copping
to another charge.

145
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:21,199
Leon, take a good Iook
around. Do you see your
Iawyer in the cell?

146
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:23,073
Did I Mirandize you?

147
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:25,274
Then nothing you
say is admissible.

148
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,041
A career criminal
should know better.

149
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:28,605
Hey, I ain't no
career criminal.

150
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:32,551
Look, we just want to know
who bought the ID,
off the record.

151
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,713
On the record,
you help us out,
we'II talk to the D.A.,

152
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,781
you finish out your sentence
in a halfway house.

153
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,124
(SIGHS)

154
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:49,629
Oh, yeah.
I met this chick
in a diner.

155
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:52,832
Said she couldn't find work
'cause she had no ID.

156
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:53,999
I felt sorry for her.

157
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,406
Okay. Did you
get her real name?

158
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,871
Said it was Jill.
Son's name is Tommy.

159
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:01,947
You sure that's
his real name?

160
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:04,541
Sure, I'm sure.
Same as my kid brother.

161
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,181
We'II talk to the D.A.

162
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:09,746
Open the gate.

163
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:10,813
(BUZZING)

164
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:17,189
Jill calls the kid
Tommy to this mope,
but Mikey to the neighbors?

165
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,960
And he answers to both.

166
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,763
You add that to the fake ID
and that fleabag apartment.

167
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,031
You know, you break parole,
you run from creditors,

168
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,732
you change your name.

169
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:29,538
You change your kid's name,
you're hiding from
something bigger.

170
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,101
(BEEPING)

171
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,910
Warner wants us
at the morgue.

172
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:38,746
WARNER: Jill's head CT.

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,251
Two subdural hematomas,

174
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:43,085
consistent with
the two blows from the Iamp
found at the scene.

175
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,419
I thought you had
something new for us?

176
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:45,959
I've got a time frame
for the assault.

177
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:47,261
How?

178
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,489
The brain shrank away
from the injury site,

179
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,589
and she bled out
into the skull cavity.

180
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,463
Now, based on
the amount of blood,

181
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:56,663
the attack occurred
seven to nine hours
before these were taken.

182
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:58,603
So backtrack from
the hospital admission,

183
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:01,608
that puts it
between 9:00 and
11:00 Iast night.

184
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:04,144
The fire department
didn't get the call
till 5:00 a.m.

185
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,772
Tommy was alone
for six hours
watching her die.

186
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:10,340
Tommy's the reason
I called you over here.

187
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:12,943
See these old
surgical incisions
on her abdomen?

188
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:16,650
The one in
the upper Ieft quadrant
is from a splenectomy.

189
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,453
She had her
spleen removed,
so what?

190
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:21,086
I'd say she had
Hodgkin's disease
as a child.

191
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,130
The treatment also
includes chemotherapy,

192
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,688
which probably
would have Ieft her
unable to have children.

193
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:28,201
So I took a sample
of Tommy's blood
from the hospital

194
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,601
and ran his DNA
against the victim's.

195
00:09:30,672 --> 00:09:31,900
No match.

196
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,337
She's not his mother.

197
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:40,844
This kid has been Iiving
with a woman who is not
his biological mother.

198
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:41,973
Well,
he could be adopted.

199
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,381
Well, that doesn't
fit with the fake ID,

200
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,783
and changing his name
from Tommy to Mikey.

201
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,047
A kidnap?

202
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,180
Nothing came up
in the missing
child databanks.

203
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,225
And Iet's hope
it's not a baby snatcher.

204
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,021
Trying to match
an infant's photo

205
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,755
with a 6-year-old,
that's impossible.

206
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,888
Is he any closer
to opening up?

207
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:58,830
We're making progress.
He Iikes to draw.

208
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,800
He's using his art
to communicate.

209
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,664
Look at this.

210
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,873
He drew the murder.

211
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,340
How do we
get him to
talk about it?

212
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:12,368
Well, he's identified you
as someone who
cares about him.

213
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,472
Make him feel safe.

214
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,414
That's a great picture.

215
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:20,079
Got grass and trees,
a bright yellow sun.

216
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,281
You draw really well, Tommy.

217
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:27,552
Yeah, Tommy.
I know your real name.

218
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:33,462
And I know that
you're a very brave boy.

219
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:40,570
Don't be afraid, Tommy.
It's okay. You know why?
'Cause I'm here to help you.

220
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:42,633
See that?

221
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,678
That's what
police officers do.

222
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,803
They help Iittle boys
that are afraid.

223
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,452
What?

224
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,215
You want my phone?

225
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,622
Here you go.

226
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:02,592
9-1-1.

227
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:03,756
That's exactly right.

228
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,265
That's who you call
when you want the police.

229
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,767
Good job.

230
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,235
Do you know your
home phone number?

231
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:19,645
How about...

232
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:23,140
Do you know
any other numbers?
Like say

233
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:26,152
a number that
you would call
in an emergency?

234
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,358
Good. You're so smart.
You know what?

235
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:35,862
I'm gonna be back
in a Iittle while,

236
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,330
but I was wondering
if you'd do me a favor?

237
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,833
Will you draw me
another picture?

238
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:44,696
Thanks.

239
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,637
I'll be back in
a little bit, all right?

240
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,311
Let's see who he called.

241
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,550
It's a domestic
violence hotline.

242
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:04,985
Oh, God,
it's Jill Hoffman.

243
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,320
The bastard
finally did it.

244
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,555
Her husband?

245
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,359
Dan Hoffman.
Violent son of a bitch.

246
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:14,300
Jill wanted to Ieave,
but she had nowhere to go.

247
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:18,429
He isolated her completely,
drove all her friends away.

248
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,269
You place her
in a DV shelter?

249
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,572
Jill stayed in one of our
safe houses for three weeks,
then she Ieft.

250
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,441
When she found an apartment
in Hell's Kitchen?

251
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,346
No, she went back to
her husband in Rye.

252
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,680
She couldn't bear to Ieave
her stepson behind.

253
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:31,844
You mean Tommy?

254
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,887
She Ioved that child
Iike he was her own son.

255
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,389
Well, then why
didn't Jill take Tommy
with her to the safe house?

256
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:38,425
She wanted to,
but we couldn't allow it.

257
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:39,551
Jill's his stepmother.

258
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,152
She had no Iegal right
to take Tommy
from his father.

259
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,698
If she'd brought him here,
we'd be accessories
to kidnapping.

260
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:47,394
So that's it?
You couldn't do anything?

261
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:49,095
Our hands were tied.

262
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,501
We told her to
fight for Iegal custody.

263
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,505
We even found Jill
a pro bono attorney.

264
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:56,802
I'II confirm Jill
was my client, but
anything else is privileged.

265
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:58,505
She hired you
to help her protect Tommy.

266
00:12:58,579 --> 00:12:59,910
We're trying to do
the same thing.

267
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,039
Where's Tommy now?

268
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,448
He's in the hospital,
too traumatized to speak.

269
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,384
Tommy saw the attack.

270
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,786
He spent the night
trying to help
Jill as she died.

271
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,881
You sending him
back to his father?

272
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,155
Unless you give
us good reasons
why we shouldn't.

273
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,455
Jill married Dan Hoffman
two years ago.

274
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,658
The abuse started
soon after.

275
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:22,293
What happened to
Tommy's real mother?

276
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,338
Kim Ieft when
Tommy was three.

277
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,737
Hoffman probably
beat her, too.

278
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:29,538
Did Hoffman ever
abuse Tommy?

279
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,101
He terrorized him
psychologically,

280
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,775
but he had never
Iaid a hand on the boy yet.

281
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,286
Jill knew it was only a matter
of time before Hoffman turned
his rage against his son.

282
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,150
Any official
complaints of abuse?

283
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,086
Against Dan Hoffman?

284
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:46,058
Respected member
of the community?

285
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,288
She thought no one
would believe her.
BENSON: You did.

286
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:52,162
I know the signs.
Jill Hoffman was
definitely abused.

287
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,700
So what was your plan?

288
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,326
File for
emergency custody.

289
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:58,338
It was a Iong shot,
even with a good judge.

290
00:13:58,406 --> 00:14:00,397
You knew she'd Iose.

291
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:03,500
You told Jill to
take Tommy, didn't you?

292
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,546
I'm an officer
of the court.

293
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:09,481
If I abetted my client
in the commission
of a felony, I'd be disbarred.

294
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,117
CHIEF ROSSANNO: Tommy Hoffman?
Dan Hoffman's son?
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,588
No. You got
your wires crossed.

296
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,558
Tommy's down in
FIorida with his stepmom.
Little winter getaway.

297
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:22,653
Yeah? Anything go on
in this town that
you don't know about?

298
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,359
I happened to bump into Dan
Iast week at the EIks CIub,
he mentioned it.

299
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:27,867
What kind of guy
is Hoffman?

300
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,469
Nicest guy in the world.

301
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:30,970
Successful real estate agent,

302
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,303
sells big houses
to folks escaping
crime in your city.

303
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,036
Any history with
family problems?

304
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,135
Just that tramp
of a first wife.

305
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:41,410
Kim ran away
with another man,
Ieft Dan and the boy.

306
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:43,040
But Dan rose to the occasion,

307
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:45,551
never misses a soccer game
or a parent-teacher
conference.

308
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,021
So your officers have never
responded to a domestic
dispute over at the Hoffmans?

309
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,318
You're barking
up the wrong tree.

310
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,827
Dan Hoffman's done
more for this
community than anybody.

311
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:57,092
Here. Picture of him
in the Rye Journal.

312
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:58,758
Go see those folks.

313
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,894
Not a week goes by,
Dan's not in their paper
for some deed or another.

314
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,461
Take your pick.
Hoffman's a major player
in Rye.

315
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,029
We've got Iots of pictures.

316
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:10,373
Uh, we'd Iike some
of his son, too.
Oh, all right, um...

317
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:14,178
(EXCLAIMS) Here's Tommy.

318
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:17,840
Tommy with Jill at
the school bake sale.
Cute kid.

319
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,216
Do you have any
of Tommy's mother?

320
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:20,684
His real mother.

321
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:23,553
I don't see why I bother
to keep shots of Kim.

322
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:26,184
She'II never show her face
in this town again.

323
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,557
Why did you say
you needed these?

324
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:30,654
We are, um, trying to trace
the heirs to an estate,

325
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:34,861
so if this is the right
Hoffman, then the kid
just inherited a bundle.

326
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:37,200
Hey, Tommy,
I made you a book.

327
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,003
See, it's got
your name on it.

328
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:49,208
There's you
playing soccer.

329
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:56,013
And there's you and Jill.

330
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,428
You know who that is, Tommy?

331
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:17,010
It's my mom.

332
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:22,848
That's right, Tommy.

333
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,510
That's your mom.

334
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:29,282
My dad said she ran away.

335
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:31,826
She didn't Iove us anymore.

336
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:36,923
But then Jill came
to Iive with you.

337
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:42,927
She made me cookies
and tucked me in
every night.

338
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,967
But then Jill went away, too?

339
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:53,181
She came back for me.

340
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,979
We ran away from my dad.

341
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,145
It's okay, sweetie.

342
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:02,452
Tommy, it's okay.
You can tell me.

343
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:05,322
We were gonna
get a new house.
Uh-huh.

344
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:09,296
Far away, where my dad
can never find us.

345
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:10,592
But...

346
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,760
Go on.
HOFFMAN: Tommy!

347
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:13,960
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

348
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:16,470
My dad, he's here.

349
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:20,236
STABLER: SIow down. Hey!
What are you doing to him?

350
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:22,367
Tommy, come here.
It's okay,
Daddy's here.

351
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:24,036
I need to see my son.

352
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:26,546
You have had him
here this whole time
and no one has told me.

353
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,105
Calm down.
You're scaring him.

354
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:30,845
I am his father.
He needs me. Tommy...

355
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,682
Hold on. SIow down.

356
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:36,323
Tommy, you do not
have to go with him,
okay, honey?

357
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:38,621
Like hell he doesn't.
He's been medically cleared.

358
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,558
HOFFMAN: And you can't stop me
from taking him home.

359
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:43,291
Released in
the custody
of his father.

360
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:48,193
Oh, thank God I found you.

361
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:49,998
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

362
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:52,432
Everything's gonna be okay.

363
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,545
Dan Hoffman's
attorney called.

364
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:04,608
She's threatening to sue
for the emotional distress

365
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,654
of withholding information
on Tommy's whereabouts.

366
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,745
Distress, my ass.

367
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:11,020
Hoffman didn't even file
a missing persons report,
and he's trying to jack us up?

368
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:13,391
We only delayed notification
by a couple of hours.

369
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:14,588
That's not the point.

370
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:16,790
You were playing
fast and Ioose,
and you got caught.

371
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:19,891
Well, can you blame us, AIex?
Now the boy is
in the custody of a killer.

372
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,595
AIIeged killer.

373
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:25,139
AII you have so far
is your gut instinct
that Hoffman murdered Jill.

374
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,299
It could still be a burglary.

375
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:29,707
Tommy was about to
tell me what happened
when his father showed up.

376
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:31,109
We need to re-interview him.

377
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,544
CABOT: Hoffman's attorney
will fight it.

378
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:36,241
So get a court order.
Tommy is a material
witness to the murder.

379
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:38,684
I'II try,
but some hard evidence
on the homicide

380
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:41,278
would go a Iong way
with the judge.

381
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,889
HOFFMAN: Haven't you caused
enough trouble already?

382
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,861
Well, sir,
we just came by
to apologize.

383
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,726
We're very sorry
about the misunderstanding.

384
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,925
You have both of
our condolences
on your Ioss.

385
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,161
Well, I appreciate
your sympathies.

386
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:56,568
But I'm still considering
a Iawsuit.

387
00:18:56,638 --> 00:19:00,438
STABLER: As a father,
I can only imagine
how terrible this is for you.

388
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,301
I'm glad you understand.

389
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:03,867
How is Tommy doing?

390
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,435
Well, I've consulted
a psychiatrist

391
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:07,778
who assures me
that Tommy will
make a full recovery.

392
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,409
Good,
that's great news.

393
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,510
Mr. Hoffman,
would you consider

394
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:14,612
allowing us to
speak with Tommy?

395
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:19,183
No. Right now, I think
time to heal is in
my son's best interests.

396
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:21,388
His best interests or yours?

397
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:23,294
You know what?
I resent that,
Detective.

398
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:24,457
My wife was murdered.

399
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,160
You, of all people,
should understand.

400
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:27,928
I'm only trying
to protect my son.

401
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:30,699
BENSON: Well, how were you
protecting your son
when he was gone for a month?

402
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:31,864
You didn't even
report him missing.

403
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,204
You told everybody
that Jill and Tommy
were in FIorida.

404
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:35,641
Okay. You're right.

405
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,942
I Iied, but I was
only trying to protect
my wife's reputation.

406
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:44,247
I didn't want anybody to
know how emotionally
unstable she was.

407
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,753
I thought that I was
doing the right thing.

408
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,288
Didn't you want any help
in trying to find her?

409
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:50,324
Yes. Of course I did,

410
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:53,850
but I was afraid
going to the police
would set her off.

411
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,354
Look, she's always
come back before.

412
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:57,899
So I waited.

413
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:01,932
I was worried,
but I didn't know
what else to do.

414
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,699
Where were you
the night of the murder?

415
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:11,444
I was in the city
at the Realtors'
Association dinner.

416
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:14,642
Five hundred of my colleagues
will support that.

417
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,611
Here for the open house?
You're early.

418
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,850
Actually, we're not
here about the house.

419
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,792
Now, you sat next to
Dan Hoffman at the Realtors'
Association dinner dance?

420
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:26,919
How could I forget?

421
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:29,328
Handsome man Iike that,
and he came without a date.

422
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:30,831
Did he stay for
the whole event?

423
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,427
No, by the end of
the awards he was bored,
so he went to the bar.

424
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:36,835
I would've gone with him,
but I was getting a plaque.

425
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:38,168
Well, congratulations.

426
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:39,569
Did you see him after that?

427
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:42,440
He promised me a dance,
but he never made
it back to the table.

428
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,603
I thought he stood me up.

429
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,873
STABLER: You thought?

430
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:46,672
Well, he showed up
Iater on.

431
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:47,943
I confess I was
a Iittle jealous.

432
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,177
And why is that?

433
00:20:49,252 --> 00:20:52,380
Well, he was all sweaty
and his clothes
were all messed up.

434
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:54,514
I wish he had
danced with me that way.

435
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,751
Do you remember
what time it was
when you saw him again?

436
00:20:56,826 --> 00:20:57,918
Around 11:00.

437
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:00,554
I remember because
I always call the babysitter
around then.

438
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,655
Oh, excuse me.
Come on in.

439
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:06,959
He had time to sneak out,
do the murder and
get back to tango.

440
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:08,367
With his rumpled shirt.

441
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:09,699
What about the blood?

442
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:11,171
Coveralls worked
good enough for O.J.

443
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,366
This is a weak alibi.

444
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:15,274
Maybe Cabot can use it
as ammunition
at the hearing.

445
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,173
A child's mental
health is at risk.

446
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:22,376
I'm ruling there be
no further interviews
of Tommy Hoffman

447
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:24,578
until after a full
psychological examination.

448
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:25,951
Dr. George Huang
can do the evaluation.

449
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:27,250
He's worked
with Tommy before.

450
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:29,848
PIease, don't do this.
Dr. Huang works for
the police department.

451
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:32,519
You would be forcing
my son to endure
another interrogation.

452
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:33,755
Is that true, Ms. Cabot?

453
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:35,729
Dr. Huang is
a consultant for the NYPD,

454
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:37,663
he also happens to
be highly qualified.

455
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:38,961
You're splitting hairs,
Ms. Cabot.

456
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:40,263
Look, I have already
made an appointment

457
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:42,600
for Tommy to start therapy
with a Dr. Mildred Souther.

458
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:45,140
AII right?
She's a child specialist
in trauma.

459
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:47,266
Why does Tommy
have to see
two psychiatrists?

460
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:50,005
I agree. The court will await
Dr. Souther's evaluation.

461
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,776
Then at Ieast put the child
in foster care until after
the evaluation is complete.

462
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,010
Tommy Hoffman is
the only eyewitness
to a homicide

463
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:57,916
that may well
have been committed
by his father.

464
00:21:57,987 --> 00:21:59,648
There's absolutely
no evidence to suggest

465
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:02,282
my client had anything to do
with his wife's tragic death.

466
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,883
Mr. Hoffman's alibi
for the time of
the murder is shaky,

467
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,484
and there's a history
of domestic violence.

468
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:09,588
That is a Iie.
I would never hurt Jill.

469
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,657
Jill Hoffman was
an unstable woman
making wild allegations

470
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:14,896
because Dan Hoffman
wanted a divorce.

471
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,337
She abducted the boy
in an act of revenge
against my client.

472
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:22,002
The police have no evidence
that my client knew where
Jill or the boy were hiding.

473
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:26,071
I've heard enough.
The child will remain
in his father's custody.

474
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:31,380
Dan is a kind and gentle man.
He's incapable of violence.

475
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:33,115
How can I convince you?

476
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:35,214
Let the police interview him.

477
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:38,192
For starters, Iet's talk
about that 45-minute gap
in your alibi.

478
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,693
It was a boring,
rubber chicken dinner.

479
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:41,161
I went to the bar
for a drink.

480
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,790
Try again. We checked.
The bartender
doesn't remember you.

481
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,834
Well, why would he?
I mean, it was a mob scene,

482
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:49,064
so I went outside to
get some fresh air,
chatted with some people.

483
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:50,969
Just give us their names
and we're done here.

484
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,099
I don't know their names.
I mean, you don't ask for ID

485
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:55,234
when you're chatting about
the Yankees' scouting report.

486
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:57,040
There you are,
at a dinner dance,

487
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:58,808
Iess than a mile
from Jill's apartment.

488
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:00,872
You jump in a cab,
you're there in
Iess than five minutes.

489
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,316
If I had known
where Jill Iived,
I would've gone there

490
00:23:03,386 --> 00:23:06,287
and I would have
convinced her
to come home.

491
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,780
I thought you
wanted a divorce?

492
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,383
I wanted my son back.

493
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,494
I mean, if Jill
wanted to Ieave,
that's fine,

494
00:23:13,562 --> 00:23:14,995
but I wasn't going to
Iet her take my son.

495
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:18,124
You've got an answer
for everything, don't you?

496
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,293
I'm not buying your
Ioving father act.

497
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:22,563
Tommy is terrified of you.

498
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:24,970
My son is everything to me.
I would die for my son.

499
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,632
BENSON:
Tommy almost died for you.

500
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:30,201
You killed Jill, and then
you Ieft him alone
in that apartment.

501
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,679
And had firefighters
not responded so fast,

502
00:23:32,748 --> 00:23:34,909
then you'd be burying him
along with your dead wife.

503
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:39,648
You wouldn't dare talk to me
Iike that if you didn't have
that badge and gun.

504
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:44,989
You notice, in the interview,
Hoffman never called Tommy or
Jill by their names?

505
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,550
It was always
"my wife," "my son."

506
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:49,427
Possessions, not people.
Hoffman owned his family.

507
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:50,897
He had to punish
Jill for Ieaving.

508
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:53,434
Power and control.
Two classic signs
of a batterer.

509
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:56,300
Well, so far
we can't even prove
that he found Jill.

510
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:59,341
I may have something
to help you on that.
Bring it on.

511
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:01,672
She opened a new
checking account
under the name Dana McGuire.

512
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:03,109
I talked to
the real Mrs. McGuire.

513
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,510
It's not hers.

514
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,013
So it's Jill's.
She write any checks?

515
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,446
No. She made cash withdrawals

516
00:24:07,516 --> 00:24:10,781
and deposited
a couple of paychecks
from J.A.G. Enterprises.

517
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:11,979
Jill was working?

518
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:15,581
Yeah, as an entertainer
at Benny's Topless on 12th.

519
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:19,150
Jill was real sweet,
but she was a Iousy dancer.

520
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:20,991
STABLER: Why'd they hire her?

521
00:24:21,063 --> 00:24:24,624
Lot of commuters stop in
on their way back
to the burbs.

522
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,602
Jill Iooked Iike
Susie Homemaker,
that turned them on.

523
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:32,471
One guy said it was
Iike having June CIeaver
give you a Iap dance.

524
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,735
Why did Jill quit?

525
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:37,939
I'm not sure, but she had
a major freak out
about a week ago.

526
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:39,275
STABLER: Over what?

527
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:43,284
Uh, she saw a guy in the crowd
she knew from the town
she used to Iive in.

528
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:45,684
She mention his name?
MANDY: No.

529
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:48,917
But a couple of days
Iater she was gone.

530
00:24:48,991 --> 00:24:51,516
What night was that,
that she, uh, saw the guy?

531
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:54,358
It was a week ago,
Iast Tuesday. Um...

532
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:59,163
I remember it 'cause that was
the night I introduced
the cockatoo into my act.

533
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:01,863
Okay. Thank you.

534
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,064
Hey, nail the prick,
will you?

535
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,768
We'II do our best.

536
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:11,870
Let's check
the credit card receipts,
see who came in here from Rye.

537
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:15,178
Mr. Rizzo, you're quite
a big spender over there
at Benny's Topless.

538
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:16,718
Look, you can't tell my wife.

539
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:18,309
She thinks I work
a Iot of overtime.

540
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:19,647
Well, so help us out here,

541
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:22,054
we won't have to
take a drive up to Rye
and talk to you at home.

542
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:23,853
Whatever you need.

543
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:25,052
You know Dan Hoffman?

544
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,422
Yeah.
He's a great guy.

545
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:29,063
I handle a Iot
of his closings
out of my office in Rye.

546
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:32,259
Did you take Hoffman
to the strip club,
you know, boys night out?

547
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:34,268
No, but I tried.

548
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:36,337
Especially after
I saw that stripper.

549
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:37,804
She's a dead ringer
for his wife.

550
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:39,704
Did you tell Hoffman
about this stripper?

551
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:43,370
I called him on my way home,
you know, thought he'd get
a kick out of it.

552
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:47,939
Put her in an apron
baking cookies, half the town
would swear it was Jill.

553
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:53,518
No one spotted Dan Hoffman
in the strip club,

554
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:55,317
but he didn't have to
go inside the joint.

555
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:55,415
Once he knew
where Jill worked,

556
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:57,153
it would've been easy enough
to follow her home.

557
00:25:57,227 --> 00:25:59,695
The night of
the dinner dance,
he slips out, he kills her.

558
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:01,355
I mean, it's almost
the perfect crime,

559
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:04,696
except for the fact that
his alibi has a hole
you can drive a truck through.

560
00:26:04,768 --> 00:26:07,896
Nobody at the dance
remembers seeing him
for a full 45 minutes.

561
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:10,496
So,
what do you say, Counselor,
we got probable cause?

562
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:13,236
It's all circumstantial,
but it's enough
for an arrest.

563
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,937
Well, don't Iook so happy.

564
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,036
We may not survive
the grand jury.

565
00:26:17,581 --> 00:26:18,570
Why not?

566
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:20,081
Dan Hoffman will testify.

567
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,777
His father-of-the-year act
has everybody fooled.

568
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:27,221
He's handsome, charismatic,
and he plays the grieving
widower very well.

569
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,919
I think Mr. Wonderful is
going to dirty up the victim
and the jury might not indict.

570
00:26:30,994 --> 00:26:32,791
Stop him from testifying.

571
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:35,956
I can't.
Once he's arrested,
it's his right.

572
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:38,330
His attorney
will serve notice
at arraignment.

573
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:40,028
So we're stuck.

574
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:43,095
I could do
a silent indictment
without arresting him.

575
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:45,164
If I present
the facts to the grand jury

576
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:47,505
as part of an investigation
into the homicide,

577
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:49,636
I'm not obligated
to notify Hoffman.

578
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:53,114
If the defense is out of
the Ioop, then Hoffman can't
assert his right to testify.

579
00:26:53,183 --> 00:26:56,710
I'II indict him
in the morning.
Then you can pick him up.

580
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:58,915
BENSON: Tommy.

581
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:01,714
How you doing?

582
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:04,726
Tommy, come back inside.

583
00:27:05,862 --> 00:27:08,456
Come on, buddy, you gotta
pick out which video
we're gonna watch.

584
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:12,228
How about you show me
some of those soccer moves.
Come on.

585
00:27:12,302 --> 00:27:14,099
AII right. That's it,
I'm calling my attorney.

586
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,968
Gonna file a restraining order
against you both
and then sue for harassment.

587
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,873
You wanna make a call?
Tell her to meet you
at Rikers. Turn around.

588
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:22,036
You can't prove anything.
Turn around.

589
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:25,007
The grand jury disagrees.

590
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:28,915
Dan Hoffman, you're
under arrest for the murder
of Jill Hoffman.

591
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:30,680
You have the right
to remain silent.

592
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,515
If you give up that right...

593
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:35,820
It's okay.
It's okay, Tommy.

594
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:40,090
"Indictment number 4319,
People v. Daniel Hoffman.

595
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:41,528
"Murder in the Second Degree."

596
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:42,826
How does the defendant plead?

597
00:27:42,966 --> 00:27:44,228
Not guilty.

598
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,029
CABOT: The People
request remand, Your Honor.

599
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:49,037
My client is
a community Ieader
with no criminal record

600
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,936
and the sole
caretaker of his son.

601
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,669
Well, he wouldn't
be a single parent
if he hadn't killed his wife.

602
00:27:53,743 --> 00:27:55,210
Control yourself, Ms. Cabot.

603
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,542
Bail is $100,000,
cash or bond.

604
00:27:57,614 --> 00:27:59,172
We request
a speedy trial date.

605
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:01,479
My client is eager to
prove his innocence,

606
00:28:01,551 --> 00:28:04,611
an opportunity the A.D.A.
denied him
in the grand jury.

607
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,918
The district attorney
is under no obligation
to inform him...

608
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,391
I know the Iaw, Ms. Cabot,
I also know your
reputation for bending it.

609
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,055
"A child's mental
health is at risk."
Your words.

610
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,098
We didn't want to
further traumatize
Tommy Hoffman

611
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,066
by having his father
arrested prematurely.

612
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:19,158
RIDENOUR: Anything else?

613
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:21,795
Motion to preclude
any witnesses stating

614
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:25,034
that Jill Hoffman told them
she'd been abused.

615
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:26,905
CABOT: Jill Hoffman was
emotionally distraught

616
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:28,967
when she spoke
to the domestic violence
shelter staff.

617
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:30,637
Her remarks clearly qualify

618
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:33,148
under the excited
utterance exception
to the hearsay rule.

619
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,410
But, Your Honor,
admitting them

620
00:28:34,484 --> 00:28:36,611
violates my client's
constitutional right

621
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:39,587
to confront and
cross-examine his accuser.

622
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:41,351
It's unduly prejudicial.

623
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:44,120
Those statements
are a key element
of my case.

624
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:47,129
Well, your case
is in trouble.
Motion granted.

625
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:49,196
We're screwed.

626
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:50,698
The defense will argue
that Jill Hoffman

627
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,327
was murdered
during a home invasion
gone bad.

628
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:56,167
There's no evidence
Dan Hoffman can use
to support that claim.

629
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,298
But there's nothing
to disprove it, either.

630
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:01,605
Jill Iived in
an unsafe neighborhood,
and she worked as a stripper.

631
00:29:01,678 --> 00:29:02,702
She was at a high risk.

632
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,747
Tommy's testimony
would convict Hoffman.

633
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:06,578
You give me a chance
and I know that

634
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:07,911
that kid will tell
me what happened.

635
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:09,849
Kid's been in foster care
since Hoffman's arrest.

636
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,181
OIivia can go interview him.

637
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:14,485
Judge Ridenour's order
not to talk to Tommy
is still in effect.

638
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:16,718
Even if Tommy says
his dad killed Jill,

639
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:19,660
his statement would be
precluded because we
disobeyed the court's ruling.

640
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,890
You could subpoena
Tommy for the trial.

641
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:23,899
It's a hell of a gamble
to put a traumatized child

642
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:25,832
on the stand unprepared.

643
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:29,531
Besides, Hoffman may have
coached Tommy to say
that a stranger did it.

644
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:32,166
What about his
biological mother?
She has rights to talk to him.

645
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:35,268
Kim Hoffman?
Yeah, well, either she
fell into a black hole,

646
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:36,642
or he murdered her, too.

647
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:38,578
Now guess
where I'm placing
my money on that one?

648
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:41,344
So far, no signs of activity
on her social security,

649
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,818
no tax returns
since she disappeared,
no signs of Iife.

650
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:47,880
Find somebody who knew
the first Mrs. Hoffman.

651
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:54,791
Mr. Wheaten, how Iong have
you Iived across the street
from the Hoffmans?

652
00:29:54,864 --> 00:29:57,059
Ten years,
before they moved in.

653
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,693
STABLER: Did you know his
first wife, Kim?

654
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:01,669
Sure, but just to say hello.

655
00:30:01,738 --> 00:30:03,433
You know,
we have been all over town

656
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:05,736
and nobody seems to know
Kim Hoffman well.

657
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:07,367
Well, I'm not surprised.

658
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:10,139
Her husband had her terrified
to talk to anyone.

659
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:12,875
I'd see her outside, wave,

660
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:13,938
she'd Iook over her shoulder

661
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:16,679
to make sure
he wasn't watching
before she'd wave back.

662
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:18,687
Did you ever
see him hurt Kim?

663
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:22,088
Kim always had bruises,
one time a broken arm.

664
00:30:22,926 --> 00:30:24,757
She said she'd tripped
over the stroller.

665
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:26,523
Did he ever say
anything after she Ieft?

666
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,188
That she'd run off
with another man.

667
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:29,754
I didn't believe it.

668
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,425
BENSON: So what do you
think really happened?

669
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:33,093
Hoffman killed her,
of course.

670
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,863
Especially after
I saw the black van.

671
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,507
BIack van?
What van?

672
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:40,575
It pulled in Iate at night.

673
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:45,080
I saw this shadowy figure
fill it with garbage bags,
then drive away.

674
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:47,048
Next day, Kim was gone.

675
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:50,911
I called the cops,
gave them the Iicense plate.

676
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,881
Dan Hoffman's not a killer.

677
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:55,083
Well, did you investigate
Kim Hoffman's disappearance?

678
00:30:55,158 --> 00:30:56,489
Did you check on
the neighbor's tip?

679
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,151
Oh, you've been talking
to Mr. Neighborhood Watch.

680
00:30:58,228 --> 00:30:59,525
Wheaten thinks he's Columbo.

681
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:01,757
Did you run the plates?

682
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:04,231
Harry, would you please pull
the Kim Hoffman file?

683
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,997
Look, we may not be
the almighty NYPD,
but we do our jobs.

684
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:11,063
Someone reports a murder,
we check it out,
even if the guy's a crackpot.

685
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,406
So, yes, we ran the plates.
Yes, they came back
to a Dawn Trent.

686
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:18,413
Soccer mom, Port Chester.
Yes, she was there.

687
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:19,778
Delivering Girl
Scout cookies.

688
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,077
May I?

689
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,517
The case is closed.
You want the file,
you're welcome to it.

690
00:31:24,587 --> 00:31:25,781
Thanks.

691
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:30,721
I'II brief Cabot,
see if we can get
her to stall the trial.

692
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:34,752
And I'II try and find
Dawn Trent. She's got
a Iot of questions to answer.

693
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:39,767
I don't know Dan Hoffman.
I already told
the Rye Police.

694
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:41,064
It must be some mistake.

695
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:42,866
Nice home you have here.

696
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:44,031
You seem to be a nice mom.

697
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:46,598
Lady Iike you
is not the usual
accessory to murder.

698
00:31:46,676 --> 00:31:47,768
Murder?

699
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:51,371
We're re-investigating
the disappearance
of Kim Hoffman.

700
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:54,072
I'm sorry,
I don't even know her.

701
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,174
STABLER: You're a Iiar.

702
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:57,310
Lady, we've got a witness
who places you there,

703
00:31:57,387 --> 00:31:59,947
at their house,
the night Kim disappeared.

704
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:03,918
Where'd you stash the body?

705
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:07,887
I don't know Dan Hoffman.

706
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:10,426
But I do know Kim.

707
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:14,599
I was there that night,
helping her Ieave.

708
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:16,229
Kim's alive?

709
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:19,434
Oh, she wouldn't be now
if I hadn't gotten her out.

710
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:21,773
It's the same old story,
Detective.

711
00:32:21,844 --> 00:32:24,244
Your husband's
the nicest guy in town,

712
00:32:24,314 --> 00:32:26,976
pals with everybody,
including the cops,

713
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,944
but every night
when he comes home,
he beats you.

714
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:32,453
He degrades you.
He terrorizes you.

715
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:35,719
Who's gonna believe
that the Man of the Year
is a batterer?

716
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:38,693
And you can't Ieave him,
there's nowhere to go.

717
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:40,285
He'II find you.
He always does.

718
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:42,354
There's nowhere to
hide in a small town.

719
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:46,458
The only way
is to get far away
and start over.

720
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,998
But that takes money.
And help.

721
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:52,902
And that's what you provide.

722
00:32:52,976 --> 00:32:54,409
Well, it's not just me.

723
00:32:54,744 --> 00:32:56,609
There's a group of us.

724
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:59,804
What is this,
some kind of DV
underground railroad?

725
00:32:59,882 --> 00:33:01,782
You could call it that.

726
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:04,752
I was Kim's first stop,
and then I passed her
on to another helper.

727
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:07,255
You grabbed her
and took her away.

728
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:08,888
Why not the kid?

729
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:12,724
(SIGHS) Kim was going to die,
Detective. We had to move.

730
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:15,430
Her hope was that
she could come back

731
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:17,261
for Tommy when she'd
gotten herself together.

732
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,133
I need to talk to Kim.

733
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:21,170
Well,
I don't know where she is.

734
00:33:21,237 --> 00:33:24,331
AII any of us know
is the next
Iink in the chain.

735
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:26,671
I picked Kim Hoffman up
from the bus station.

736
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:28,142
From there,
we drove to Poughkeepsie.

737
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:29,576
After that...

738
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:32,205
Kim was Iiving on a farm
outside of Woodstock.

739
00:33:32,281 --> 00:33:34,476
I helped her move
to New Paltz.

740
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,780
Then I heard she moved
to Brewster.

741
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:39,117
I got her settled
in Torrington.

742
00:33:39,188 --> 00:33:43,090
The Iast I heard
she was still there,
working in a dry cleaner's.

743
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:47,723
Thank you, sir.
Have a nice day.

744
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:49,264
Can I help you?

745
00:33:49,332 --> 00:33:50,924
Yeah.
I need to talk to you, Kim.

746
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,135
I'm sorry, you must
have me mistaken for
someone else. My name is...

747
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:55,500
Kim Hoffman.

748
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:57,105
No, it's not.

749
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,401
It's about Tommy.

750
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:06,011
Is Tommy okay?

751
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:07,572
Physically, yeah.

752
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:11,175
He needs you.

(SIGHS)

754
00:34:15,024 --> 00:34:17,083
I cry for him every night.

755
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:23,428
You must think
I'm a terrible mother
for Ieaving him.

756
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:25,330
I know why you Ieft.

757
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:27,232
Nobody knows how bad it was.

758
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:33,675
Dan used to
beat me so severely
that I couldn't walk.

759
00:34:33,743 --> 00:34:35,574
I had to get out.

760
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:39,247
Once I was safe,
I was gonna go
back for Tommy.

761
00:34:39,315 --> 00:34:40,646
Why didn't you?

762
00:34:40,783 --> 00:34:42,148
I did.

763
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:48,119
Once I was settled,
I went back to Rye.

764
00:34:51,194 --> 00:34:55,130
I saw him playing
in the front yard
with some woman.

765
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:56,961
He called her Mommy.

766
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:02,331
(SOBBING)

767
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:07,538
He Iooked so happy.

768
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:12,179
I thought he was better off.

769
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:14,910
He had everything
I couldn't give him.

770
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:20,281
I can't face him.

771
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:23,121
I can't face him.
Yeah, you can.

772
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:24,625
He'II never understand
why I Ieft.

773
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:26,093
He'II never understand.

774
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:27,652
What if he
doesn't Iove me anymore?

775
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,163
What if he doesn't...

776
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:30,699
Listen to me.

777
00:35:32,368 --> 00:35:35,201
Your ex-husband is
about to be acquitted.

778
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:40,265
If you don't help Tommy,
he goes back to that house.

779
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:43,540
You have to risk your
pain to save his Iife.

780
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:57,284
Jill worked in my office.

781
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,624
She was so kind
to me when Kim Ieft.

782
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:03,358
She offered to cook dinner
for Tommy and me, babysit.

783
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:05,525
So she pursued you?

784
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:08,399
I was on the rebound.
She was a beautiful woman,
I was flattered.

785
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:11,599
Did the relationship change
after the wedding?

786
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:15,576
I saw another side of Jill.
She had a terrible temper.

787
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:18,113
One night I didn't praise
her cooking enough,

788
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:20,775
and she smashed the meatloaf
all over the walls.

789
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,647
Tommy was terrified.

790
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:27,111
I just realized
that she was
emotionally unstable.

791
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:30,585
I begged her to get help.
She refused.

792
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,187
I just hoped with
enough Iove and support
that things would change.

793
00:36:34,263 --> 00:36:35,560
CHANEY: And did they?

794
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:36,995
HOFFMAN: Jill got worse.

795
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:40,001
I was afraid
that she was
gonna hurt Tommy,

796
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:43,869
so I told her that
I wanted a divorce,

797
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,340
and she said
she would make me pay.

798
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,435
The next day,
I came home, she was gone.

799
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:52,743
I mean, she'd Ieft before,
but only for a day or two.

800
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:58,048
And I was... I was relieved,
until Tommy didn't
come home from school.

801
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:03,586
And then I realized
that she had
taken him with her.

802
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:08,596
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

803
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:14,565
So you're the victim here,
Mr. Hoffman.

804
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:16,104
My son was taken from me.

805
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:18,265
You have no idea
what I went through

806
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:20,534
wondering if
Tommy was all right.

807
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,237
You Iove your son
very much, don't you?

808
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,005
Yes, I do.

809
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,709
Then explain why
you never filed
a missing persons report.

810
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:31,051
I was afraid to go to
the police. I mean...

811
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:35,718
I thought that Jill
might do something crazy
if she were cornered.

812
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,315
So you didn't
go Iook for them?

813
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,018
Of course I did.

814
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:42,826
But when a neighbor told you
that a woman bearing
an uncanny resemblance to Jill

815
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:45,025
was working at
Benny's Topless,
you didn't go check?

816
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:47,695
I never thought that
that could be true.

817
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,330
Jill was so shy
she wouldn't even
make Iove with the Iights on.

818
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:53,842
So it's a total coincidence
that within days of hearing
about the strip club,

819
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,706
your wife was
brutally murdered.

820
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:59,509
I wish that I would have
gone there. I wish that
I would have found her.

821
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:02,779
If I had,
Tommy would have been
home safe with me,

822
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:06,878
not watching
Jill get murdered
by some maniac.

823
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:15,661
Here.
Thank you.

824
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:34,045
Tommy.

825
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:39,718
Do you know who I am?

826
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:43,320
You're my real mom.

827
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,027
You remember me?

828
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,999
I have your picture.

829
00:38:55,037 --> 00:38:56,937
You missed my birthday.

830
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,075
I know.

831
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,005
I know and I'm so sorry.

832
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:09,081
But I saw your
soccer playoffs Iast year,

833
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:11,584
when you scored
that big goal.

834
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:12,814
You did?

835
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:14,115
Oh, yeah.

836
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:17,322
I cheered my heart out.

837
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:21,062
Then why didn't you
come and see me?

838
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:25,356
I was scared.

839
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:27,701

00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:29,236
Yes, honey.

He scares me a Iot.

842
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:35,407
Me, too.

No.

845
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:49,481
No, I will never
ever go away again.
