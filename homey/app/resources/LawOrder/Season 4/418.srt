1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:05,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:06,998
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:10,009
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:13,638
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,375
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,210
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,083
PIease, honey,
open the door.

9
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,715
You can do it.
Come on.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,718
Hurry. Hurry, there's
a Iittle kid trapped in there
and he can't reach the knob.

11
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,922
What's his name?
Mikey.

12
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,332
Mikey, fire department.
Can you hear me?

13
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,599
Mikey,
I need you to stand
away from the door.

14
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,731
Get as far back
as you can, okay?

15
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,173
Take the door, guys.

16
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,674
Hit it.

17
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,375
You take the back.
I'II take the front.

18
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,712
10-26,
food on the stove.

19
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:52,946
FIREFIGHTER:
Roger that, 10-26.

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,146
We're clear.

21
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,054
Mikey? Mikey,
where are you?

22
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,983
Mikey?

23
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,832
The kid's injured.
Come on. Let's get you
out of here.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,592
FIREFIGHTER 2: Over here.
She's barely breathing.

25
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,999
I got him.

26
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,538
10-45. Code 2.
Start out a bus.

27
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,698
DISPATCHER: 10-4.
Bus is on the way.

28
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,608
The mother's critical.
Major head trauma.

29
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,078
CT shows multiple
subdural hematomas.

30
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,981
She gonna make it?
It's hard to say.
She's in surgery right now.

31
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,109
And the sexual assault?

32
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:27,677
Genital trauma shows
she was raped
and sodomized.

33
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,586
We didn't find
any fluids.

34
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,147
How's the boy?
Hmm.

35
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,782
No physical injuries.

36
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,192
AII the blood
on Mikey
was his mom's.

37
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,457
He may have seen it.
You mind
if I talk to him?

38
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,998
No. Go ahead.

39
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:41,930
Mikey?

40
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,932
My name is OIivia.
How old are you?

41
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:51,670
Six?

42
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,712
Mikey, I need to talk to you
about what happened
in the apartment.

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,756
Did you see your
mommy get hurt?

44
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,288
Can you tell me
about it?

45
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,511
That's right, honey,
I'm a police officer.

46
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,309
And I need your help
to find the person
who hurt your mom.

47
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,380
OIivia.

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,956
I'II be back in
a Iittle while, okay?

49
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,161
This is gonna take
some time.

50
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,066
Maybe once
he sees his mother.
She just died.

51
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,283
Anything on
next of kin?

52
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,846
Well, no handbag,
no wallet.

53
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,518
Perp took everything
he could. And this guy's
very careful.

54
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,154
So far, no prints,
no semen, no hair.

55
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,458
Why target
this apartment?

56
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,555
Easy access.

57
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:55,295
Ground floor, no gates,
the Iocks are
a piece of crap.

58
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,463
From the tool marks,
I'd say he forced the Iock
with a screwdriver.

59
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,938
The victim is
on her back.

60
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,269
He gets on the bed,
straddles her.

61
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,400
She struggles.

62
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,034
He grabs this Iamp
from that table.

63
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,635
Knocks her out
with two blows.

64
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,180
Our victim's face
was a mess.

65
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,781
Are you sure that
he only hit her twice?

66
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,941
BIood doesn't Iie.

67
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,212
See that single
Iine on the ceiling?
BENSON: Yeah.

68
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,914
First blow
starts the blood flow,
second makes that pattern.

69
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,082
After the rape,
he beats her some more,
but it's overkill.

70
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,590
She's already
unconscious.

71
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,683
Well, how'd you get that?

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,558
BIood spatter
on the sofa back
is concentrated in one area.

73
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,257
Doesn't Iook Iike
she moved
to evade the blows.

74
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,629
AII the damage
was to her face.
This feels personal.

75
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,191
Maybe it's not
some random break-in
we're Iooking at.

76
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,999
If she was
knocked out during
the sexual assault,

77
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,732
maybe Mikey
slept through it.

78
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,899
I don't think so.
See the handprints?

79
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:38,035
Well, maybe Mikey
tried to wake Mommy up,
he got his hand in the blood.

80
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,012
Could've happened
after the perp Ieft.

81
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,105
Possible, but
see the urine stain.

82
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,681
Boy hid
in the doorway,
watching.

83
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,243
What he saw
scared him so much,
he wet his pants.

84
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,256
So if Mikey woke up,
maybe somebody else did.

85
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,151
The walls are paper thin,
but I didn't hear nothing.

86
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,354
Smoke woke me up.

87
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,125
We're trying
to Iocate
family members.

88
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,359
What can you
tell us about
Mikey and his mom?

89
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,767
Said her name was Dana,
didn't give me
the family tree.

90
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,498
Moved in a month ago.

91
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,938
Dana have any visitors,
maybe a boyfriend?

92
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,738
I didn't see nobody
except her and the boy.

93
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,779
Well, did she ever say
anything about family,

94
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,814
maybe mention where
they used to Iive?

95
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,076
The Iandlord might know.

96
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,310
Good. He around?

97
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,375
That bastard only
comes to collect the rent.

98
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,648
He's got an office
in midtown.

99
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,117
I bet you it's
a hell of a Iot nicer
than this dump.

100
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,127
Apartment 1-H.
That would be, uh,
Dana McGuire.

101
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,323
Okay. We'II need the rental
application, credit report,
any other papers.

102
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,990
Sorry, my secretary
called in sick.

103
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,760
I don't know where
she keeps those files.

104
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,360
A Iandlord who
can't find a Iease?
Hey, I'm a busy man.

105
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,271
I got better things
to do than Iisten to
a cop crack wise.

106
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,638
I've got calls to make.

107
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,176
I'II have her
get in touch.

108
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,572
Friend of mine at
the D.A.'s office
Ioves to prosecute slumlords.

109
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,842
Last guy,
got sentenced
to six months

110
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,180
Iiving in his own
condemned building.

111
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:55,378
Look, I don't have
any paper on her.
It was off the books.

112
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,754
Lady paid cash up
front for three months.

113
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,419
Which we'II be glad
to pass on to the IRS,
in case you forgot.

114
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,927
Hey, I'm trying
to be helpful here.

115
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,520
STABLER: So far,
you're coming up short.

116
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:08,466
Okay. Wait a minute.
Um, she showed me
her driver's Iicense.

117
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,095
Address was on
Central Park West,
300 block.

118
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,832
Your memory's
a Iittle convenient.

119
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,067
Names I'm not so good at,

120
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:18,441
but I never forget
a prime piece
of real estate.

121
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,009
(DOOR OPENING)

122
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,744
Can I help you?
Yeah. NYPD,
good afternoon.

123
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,513
Wondering if you
know a, uh, Dana McGuire?

124
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,146
Of course I do.
I'm her husband.

125
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,521
Mr. McGuire,
when was the Iast time
you saw your wife?

126
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,389
About five minutes ago.

127
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,324
She's inside,
feeding the baby.

128
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,294
A dead woman
was using my ID?

129
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,129
That's so creepy.

130
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,294
Any idea how
she got a hold of
your driver's Iicense?

131
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,066
Uh, I was mugged
on my way back
from Mommy & Me class.

132
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,109
In broad daylight
on Columbus Avenue.
Not a cop in sight.

133
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,905
Mrs. McGuire,
did you report
the robbery?

134
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,070
Yeah, a Iot of good it did.

135
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,137
Honey, they're just
trying to help.

136
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,615
They caught the guy
maxing out my
credit cards at Macy's.

137
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,745
D.A. plea-bargained
the case. He only got
six months at Rikers.

138
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,985
Those yuppie moms,
pushing their strollers,

139
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,323
carrying diaper bags,
yoga mats and crap.

140
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,894
Easy pickings.

141
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,090
I checked your booking sheet.

142
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,690
Dana McGuire's
driver's Iicense

143
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,257
was not on you when
you were collared.

144
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,600
What are you smoking?
No way I'm copping
to another charge.

145
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,199
Leon, take a good Iook
around. Do you see your
Iawyer in the cell?

146
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,073
Did I Mirandize you?

147
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,274
Then nothing you
say is admissible.

148
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,041
A career criminal
should know better.

149
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,605
Hey, I ain't no
career criminal.

150
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,551
Look, we just want to know
who bought the ID,
off the record.

151
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,713
On the record,
you help us out,
we'II talk to the D.A.,

152
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,781
you finish out your sentence
in a halfway house.

153
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,124
(SIGHS)

154
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,629
Oh, yeah.
I met this chick
in a diner.

155
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,832
Said she couldn't find work
'cause she had no ID.

156
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:54,999
I felt sorry for her.

157
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,406
Okay. Did you
get her real name?

158
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,871
Said it was Jill.
Son's name is Tommy.

159
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:02,947
You sure that's
his real name?

160
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,541
Sure, I'm sure.
Same as my kid brother.

161
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,181
We'II talk to the D.A.

162
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,746
Open the gate.

163
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,813
(BUZZING)

164
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,189
Jill calls the kid
Tommy to this mope,
but Mikey to the neighbors?

165
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,960
And he answers to both.

166
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,763
You add that to the fake ID
and that fleabag apartment.

167
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,031
You know, you break parole,
you run from creditors,

168
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,732
you change your name.

169
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:30,538
You change your kid's name,
you're hiding from
something bigger.

170
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,101
(BEEPING)

171
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,910
Warner wants us
at the morgue.

172
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:39,746
WARNER: Jill's head CT.

173
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,251
Two subdural hematomas,

174
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,085
consistent with
the two blows from the Iamp
found at the scene.

175
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,419
I thought you had
something new for us?

176
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,959
I've got a time frame
for the assault.

177
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,261
How?

178
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,489
The brain shrank away
from the injury site,

179
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,589
and she bled out
into the skull cavity.

180
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,463
Now, based on
the amount of blood,

181
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,663
the attack occurred
seven to nine hours
before these were taken.

182
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,603
So backtrack from
the hospital admission,

183
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,608
that puts it
between 9:00 and
11:00 Iast night.

184
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,144
The fire department
didn't get the call
till 5:00 a.m.

185
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,772
Tommy was alone
for six hours
watching her die.

186
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:11,340
Tommy's the reason
I called you over here.

187
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,943
See these old
surgical incisions
on her abdomen?

188
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:17,650
The one in
the upper Ieft quadrant
is from a splenectomy.

189
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,453
She had her
spleen removed,
so what?

190
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,086
I'd say she had
Hodgkin's disease
as a child.

191
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,130
The treatment also
includes chemotherapy,

192
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,688
which probably
would have Ieft her
unable to have children.

193
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,201
So I took a sample
of Tommy's blood
from the hospital

194
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,601
and ran his DNA
against the victim's.

195
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:32,900
No match.

196
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,337
She's not his mother.

197
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,844
This kid has been Iiving
with a woman who is not
his biological mother.

198
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,973
Well,
he could be adopted.

199
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,381
Well, that doesn't
fit with the fake ID,

200
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,783
and changing his name
from Tommy to Mikey.

201
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,047
A kidnap?

202
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,180
Nothing came up
in the missing
child databanks.

203
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,225
And Iet's hope
it's not a baby snatcher.

204
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,021
Trying to match
an infant's photo

205
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,755
with a 6-year-old,
that's impossible.

206
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,888
Is he any closer
to opening up?

207
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,830
We're making progress.
He Iikes to draw.

208
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,800
He's using his art
to communicate.

209
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,664
Look at this.

210
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,873
He drew the murder.

211
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,340
How do we
get him to
talk about it?

212
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:13,368
Well, he's identified you
as someone who
cares about him.

213
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,472
Make him feel safe.

214
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,414
That's a great picture.

215
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:21,079
Got grass and trees,
a bright yellow sun.

216
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,281
You draw really well, Tommy.

217
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,552
Yeah, Tommy.
I know your real name.

218
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,462
And I know that
you're a very brave boy.

219
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,570
Don't be afraid, Tommy.
It's okay. You know why?
'Cause I'm here to help you.

220
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,633
See that?

221
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,678
That's what
police officers do.

222
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,803
They help Iittle boys
that are afraid.

223
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,452
What?

224
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,215
You want my phone?

225
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,622
Here you go.

226
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,592
9-1-1.

227
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,756
That's exactly right.

228
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,265
That's who you call
when you want the police.

229
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,767
Good job.

230
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,235
Do you know your
home phone number?

231
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,645
How about...

232
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,140
Do you know
any other numbers?
Like say

233
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,152
a number that
you would call
in an emergency?

234
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,358
Good. You're so smart.
You know what?

235
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,862
I'm gonna be back
in a Iittle while,

236
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,330
but I was wondering
if you'd do me a favor?

237
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,833
Will you draw me
another picture?

238
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,696
Thanks.

239
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,637
I'll be back in
a little bit, all right?

240
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,311
Let's see who he called.

241
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,550
It's a domestic
violence hotline.

242
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,985
Oh, God,
it's Jill Hoffman.

243
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,320
The bastard
finally did it.

244
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,555
Her husband?

245
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,359
Dan Hoffman.
Violent son of a bitch.

246
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,300
Jill wanted to Ieave,
but she had nowhere to go.

247
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:19,429
He isolated her completely,
drove all her friends away.

248
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,269
You place her
in a DV shelter?

249
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,572
Jill stayed in one of our
safe houses for three weeks,
then she Ieft.

250
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,441
When she found an apartment
in Hell's Kitchen?

251
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,346
No, she went back to
her husband in Rye.

252
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,680
She couldn't bear to Ieave
her stepson behind.

253
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,844
You mean Tommy?

254
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,887
She Ioved that child
Iike he was her own son.

255
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,389
Well, then why
didn't Jill take Tommy
with her to the safe house?

256
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,425
She wanted to,
but we couldn't allow it.

257
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,551
Jill's his stepmother.

258
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,152
She had no Iegal right
to take Tommy
from his father.

259
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,698
If she'd brought him here,
we'd be accessories
to kidnapping.

260
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,394
So that's it?
You couldn't do anything?

261
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,095
Our hands were tied.

262
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,501
We told her to
fight for Iegal custody.

263
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,505
We even found Jill
a pro bono attorney.

264
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,802
I'II confirm Jill
was my client, but
anything else is privileged.

265
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,505
She hired you
to help her protect Tommy.

266
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,910
We're trying to do
the same thing.

267
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,039
Where's Tommy now?

268
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,448
He's in the hospital,
too traumatized to speak.

269
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,384
Tommy saw the attack.

270
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,786
He spent the night
trying to help
Jill as she died.

271
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,881
You sending him
back to his father?

272
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,155
Unless you give
us good reasons
why we shouldn't.

273
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,455
Jill married Dan Hoffman
two years ago.

274
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,658
The abuse started
soon after.

275
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,293
What happened to
Tommy's real mother?

276
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,338
Kim Ieft when
Tommy was three.

277
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,737
Hoffman probably
beat her, too.

278
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,538
Did Hoffman ever
abuse Tommy?

279
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,101
He terrorized him
psychologically,

280
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,775
but he had never
Iaid a hand on the boy yet.

281
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,286
Jill knew it was only a matter
of time before Hoffman turned
his rage against his son.

282
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,150
Any official
complaints of abuse?

283
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,086
Against Dan Hoffman?

284
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,058
Respected member
of the community?

285
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,288
She thought no one
would believe her.
BENSON: You did.

286
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:53,162
I know the signs.
Jill Hoffman was
definitely abused.

287
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,700
So what was your plan?

288
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,326
File for
emergency custody.

289
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,338
It was a Iong shot,
even with a good judge.

290
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,397
You knew she'd Iose.

291
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,500
You told Jill to
take Tommy, didn't you?

292
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,546
I'm an officer
of the court.

293
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:10,481
If I abetted my client
in the commission
of a felony, I'd be disbarred.

294
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,117
CHIEF ROSSANNO: Tommy Hoffman?
Dan Hoffman's son?
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,588
No. You got
your wires crossed.

296
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,558
Tommy's down in
FIorida with his stepmom.
Little winter getaway.

297
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,653
Yeah? Anything go on
in this town that
you don't know about?

298
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,359
I happened to bump into Dan
Iast week at the EIks CIub,
he mentioned it.

299
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,867
What kind of guy
is Hoffman?

300
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,469
Nicest guy in the world.

301
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,970
Successful real estate agent,

302
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,303
sells big houses
to folks escaping
crime in your city.

303
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,036
Any history with
family problems?

304
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,135
Just that tramp
of a first wife.

305
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,410
Kim ran away
with another man,
Ieft Dan and the boy.

306
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,040
But Dan rose to the occasion,

307
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,551
never misses a soccer game
or a parent-teacher
conference.

308
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,021
So your officers have never
responded to a domestic
dispute over at the Hoffmans?

309
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,318
You're barking
up the wrong tree.

310
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,827
Dan Hoffman's done
more for this
community than anybody.

311
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,092
Here. Picture of him
in the Rye Journal.

312
00:14:58,632 --> 00:14:59,758
Go see those folks.

313
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,894
Not a week goes by,
Dan's not in their paper
for some deed or another.

314
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,461
Take your pick.
Hoffman's a major player
in Rye.

315
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,029
We've got Iots of pictures.

316
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,373
Uh, we'd Iike some
of his son, too.
Oh, all right, um...

317
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,178
(EXCLAIMS) Here's Tommy.

318
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,840
Tommy with Jill at
the school bake sale.
Cute kid.

319
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,216
Do you have any
of Tommy's mother?

320
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,684
His real mother.

321
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,553
I don't see why I bother
to keep shots of Kim.

322
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,184
She'II never show her face
in this town again.

323
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,557
Why did you say
you needed these?

324
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,654
We are, um, trying to trace
the heirs to an estate,

325
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:35,861
so if this is the right
Hoffman, then the kid
just inherited a bundle.

326
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,200
Hey, Tommy,
I made you a book.

327
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,003
See, it's got
your name on it.

328
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,208
There's you
playing soccer.

329
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,013
And there's you and Jill.

330
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,428
You know who that is, Tommy?

331
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:18,010
It's my mom.

332
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:23,848
That's right, Tommy.

333
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,510
That's your mom.

334
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:30,282
My dad said she ran away.

335
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:32,826
She didn't Iove us anymore.

336
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:37,923
But then Jill came
to Iive with you.

337
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:43,927
She made me cookies
and tucked me in
every night.

338
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:50,967
But then Jill went away, too?

339
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:54,181
She came back for me.

340
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,979
We ran away from my dad.

341
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:00,145
It's okay, sweetie.

342
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:03,452
Tommy, it's okay.
You can tell me.

343
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,322
We were gonna
get a new house.
Uh-huh.

344
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:10,296
Far away, where my dad
can never find us.

345
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,592
But...

346
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,760
Go on.
HOFFMAN: Tommy!

347
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:14,960
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

348
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:17,470
My dad, he's here.

349
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:21,236
STABLER: SIow down. Hey!
What are you doing to him?

350
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,367
Tommy, come here.
It's okay,
Daddy's here.

351
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:25,036
I need to see my son.

352
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,546
You have had him
here this whole time
and no one has told me.

353
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,105
Calm down.
You're scaring him.

354
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,845
I am his father.
He needs me. Tommy...

355
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,682
Hold on. SIow down.

356
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,323
Tommy, you do not
have to go with him,
okay, honey?

357
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,621
Like hell he doesn't.
He's been medically cleared.

358
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,558
HOFFMAN: And you can't stop me
from taking him home.

359
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:44,291
Released in
the custody
of his father.

360
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,193
Oh, thank God I found you.

361
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,998
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

362
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,432
Everything's gonna be okay.

363
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,545
Dan Hoffman's
attorney called.

364
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,608
She's threatening to sue
for the emotional distress

365
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,654
of withholding information
on Tommy's whereabouts.

366
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:08,745
Distress, my ass.

367
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:12,020
Hoffman didn't even file
a missing persons report,
and he's trying to jack us up?

368
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:14,391
We only delayed notification
by a couple of hours.

369
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:15,588
That's not the point.

370
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:17,790
You were playing
fast and Ioose,
and you got caught.

371
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,891
Well, can you blame us, AIex?
Now the boy is
in the custody of a killer.

372
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:22,595
AIIeged killer.

373
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:26,139
AII you have so far
is your gut instinct
that Hoffman murdered Jill.

374
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:27,299
It could still be a burglary.

375
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,707
Tommy was about to
tell me what happened
when his father showed up.

376
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,109
We need to re-interview him.

377
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,544
CABOT: Hoffman's attorney
will fight it.

378
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:37,241
So get a court order.
Tommy is a material
witness to the murder.

379
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,684
I'II try,
but some hard evidence
on the homicide

380
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:42,278
would go a Iong way
with the judge.

381
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:46,889
HOFFMAN: Haven't you caused
enough trouble already?

382
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:48,861
Well, sir,
we just came by
to apologize.

383
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,726
We're very sorry
about the misunderstanding.

384
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,925
You have both of
our condolences
on your Ioss.

385
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,161
Well, I appreciate
your sympathies.

386
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:57,568
But I'm still considering
a Iawsuit.

387
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:01,438
STABLER: As a father,
I can only imagine
how terrible this is for you.

388
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,301
I'm glad you understand.

389
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,867
How is Tommy doing?

390
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,435
Well, I've consulted
a psychiatrist

391
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:08,778
who assures me
that Tommy will
make a full recovery.

392
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,409
Good,
that's great news.

393
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,510
Mr. Hoffman,
would you consider

394
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,612
allowing us to
speak with Tommy?

395
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:20,183
No. Right now, I think
time to heal is in
my son's best interests.

396
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:22,388
His best interests or yours?

397
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:24,294
You know what?
I resent that,
Detective.

398
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:25,457
My wife was murdered.

399
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,160
You, of all people,
should understand.

400
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,928
I'm only trying
to protect my son.

401
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:31,699
BENSON: Well, how were you
protecting your son
when he was gone for a month?

402
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:32,864
You didn't even
report him missing.

403
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,204
You told everybody
that Jill and Tommy
were in FIorida.

404
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:36,641
Okay. You're right.

405
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,942
I Iied, but I was
only trying to protect
my wife's reputation.

406
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:45,247
I didn't want anybody to
know how emotionally
unstable she was.

407
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,753
I thought that I was
doing the right thing.

408
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,288
Didn't you want any help
in trying to find her?

409
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,324
Yes. Of course I did,

410
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:54,850
but I was afraid
going to the police
would set her off.

411
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:58,354
Look, she's always
come back before.

412
00:19:58,432 --> 00:19:59,899
So I waited.

413
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:03,932
I was worried,
but I didn't know
what else to do.

414
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,699
Where were you
the night of the murder?

415
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:13,444
I was in the city
at the Realtors'
Association dinner.

416
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:16,642
Five hundred of my colleagues
will support that.

417
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,611
Here for the open house?
You're early.

418
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:23,850
Actually, we're not
here about the house.

419
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,792
Now, you sat next to
Dan Hoffman at the Realtors'
Association dinner dance?

420
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:28,919
How could I forget?

421
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,328
Handsome man Iike that,
and he came without a date.

422
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,831
Did he stay for
the whole event?

423
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,427
No, by the end of
the awards he was bored,
so he went to the bar.

424
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,835
I would've gone with him,
but I was getting a plaque.

425
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,168
Well, congratulations.

426
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,569
Did you see him after that?

427
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:44,440
He promised me a dance,
but he never made
it back to the table.

428
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:45,603
I thought he stood me up.

429
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,873
STABLER: You thought?

430
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:48,672
Well, he showed up
Iater on.

431
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:49,943
I confess I was
a Iittle jealous.

432
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,177
And why is that?

433
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:54,380
Well, he was all sweaty
and his clothes
were all messed up.

434
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:56,514
I wish he had
danced with me that way.

435
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,751
Do you remember
what time it was
when you saw him again?

436
00:20:58,826 --> 00:20:59,918
Around 11:00.

437
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:02,554
I remember because
I always call the babysitter
around then.

438
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,655
Oh, excuse me.
Come on in.

439
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,959
He had time to sneak out,
do the murder and
get back to tango.

440
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,367
With his rumpled shirt.

441
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,699
What about the blood?

442
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,171
Coveralls worked
good enough for O.J.

443
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,366
This is a weak alibi.

444
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,274
Maybe Cabot can use it
as ammunition
at the hearing.

445
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,173
A child's mental
health is at risk.

446
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,376
I'm ruling there be
no further interviews
of Tommy Hoffman

447
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,578
until after a full
psychological examination.

448
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:27,951
Dr. George Huang
can do the evaluation.

449
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:29,250
He's worked
with Tommy before.

450
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:31,848
PIease, don't do this.
Dr. Huang works for
the police department.

451
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,519
You would be forcing
my son to endure
another interrogation.

452
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:35,755
Is that true, Ms. Cabot?

453
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:37,729
Dr. Huang is
a consultant for the NYPD,

454
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,663
he also happens to
be highly qualified.

455
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:40,961
You're splitting hairs,
Ms. Cabot.

456
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:42,263
Look, I have already
made an appointment

457
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:44,600
for Tommy to start therapy
with a Dr. Mildred Souther.

458
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:47,140
AII right?
She's a child specialist
in trauma.

459
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,266
Why does Tommy
have to see
two psychiatrists?

460
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:52,005
I agree. The court will await
Dr. Souther's evaluation.

461
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,776
Then at Ieast put the child
in foster care until after
the evaluation is complete.

462
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:58,010
Tommy Hoffman is
the only eyewitness
to a homicide

463
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,916
that may well
have been committed
by his father.

464
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,648
There's absolutely
no evidence to suggest

465
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:04,282
my client had anything to do
with his wife's tragic death.

466
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,883
Mr. Hoffman's alibi
for the time of
the murder is shaky,

467
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,484
and there's a history
of domestic violence.

468
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:11,588
That is a Iie.
I would never hurt Jill.

469
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,657
Jill Hoffman was
an unstable woman
making wild allegations

470
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,896
because Dan Hoffman
wanted a divorce.

471
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,337
She abducted the boy
in an act of revenge
against my client.

472
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:24,002
The police have no evidence
that my client knew where
Jill or the boy were hiding.

473
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:28,071
I've heard enough.
The child will remain
in his father's custody.

474
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:33,380
Dan is a kind and gentle man.
He's incapable of violence.

475
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:35,115
How can I convince you?

476
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,214
Let the police interview him.

477
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,192
For starters, Iet's talk
about that 45-minute gap
in your alibi.

478
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,693
It was a boring,
rubber chicken dinner.

479
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:43,161
I went to the bar
for a drink.

480
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,790
Try again. We checked.
The bartender
doesn't remember you.

481
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,834
Well, why would he?
I mean, it was a mob scene,

482
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:51,064
so I went outside to
get some fresh air,
chatted with some people.

483
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,969
Just give us their names
and we're done here.

484
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,099
I don't know their names.
I mean, you don't ask for ID

485
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:57,234
when you're chatting about
the Yankees' scouting report.

486
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:59,040
There you are,
at a dinner dance,

487
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:00,808
Iess than a mile
from Jill's apartment.

488
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,872
You jump in a cab,
you're there in
Iess than five minutes.

489
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,316
If I had known
where Jill Iived,
I would've gone there

490
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:08,287
and I would have
convinced her
to come home.

491
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,780
I thought you
wanted a divorce?

492
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,383
I wanted my son back.

493
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,494
I mean, if Jill
wanted to Ieave,
that's fine,

494
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,995
but I wasn't going to
Iet her take my son.

495
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,124
You've got an answer
for everything, don't you?

496
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,293
I'm not buying your
Ioving father act.

497
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,563
Tommy is terrified of you.

498
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:26,970
My son is everything to me.
I would die for my son.

499
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,632
BENSON:
Tommy almost died for you.

500
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:32,201
You killed Jill, and then
you Ieft him alone
in that apartment.

501
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,679
And had firefighters
not responded so fast,

502
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,909
then you'd be burying him
along with your dead wife.

503
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:41,648
You wouldn't dare talk to me
Iike that if you didn't have
that badge and gun.

504
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,989
You notice, in the interview,
Hoffman never called Tommy or
Jill by their names?

505
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,550
It was always
"my wife," "my son."

506
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:51,427
Possessions, not people.
Hoffman owned his family.

507
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:52,897
He had to punish
Jill for Ieaving.

508
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,434
Power and control.
Two classic signs
of a batterer.

509
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:58,300
Well, so far
we can't even prove
that he found Jill.

510
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:01,341
I may have something
to help you on that.
Bring it on.

511
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:03,672
She opened a new
checking account
under the name Dana McGuire.

512
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:05,109
I talked to
the real Mrs. McGuire.

513
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:06,510
It's not hers.

514
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,013
So it's Jill's.
She write any checks?

515
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:09,446
No. She made cash withdrawals

516
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:12,781
and deposited
a couple of paychecks
from J.A.G. Enterprises.

517
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:13,979
Jill was working?

518
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:17,581
Yeah, as an entertainer
at Benny's Topless on 12th.

519
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:21,150
Jill was real sweet,
but she was a Iousy dancer.

520
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,991
STABLER: Why'd they hire her?

521
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:26,624
Lot of commuters stop in
on their way back
to the burbs.

522
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,602
Jill Iooked Iike
Susie Homemaker,
that turned them on.

523
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:34,471
One guy said it was
Iike having June CIeaver
give you a Iap dance.

524
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,735
Why did Jill quit?

525
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,939
I'm not sure, but she had
a major freak out
about a week ago.

526
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:41,275
STABLER: Over what?

527
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:45,284
Uh, she saw a guy in the crowd
she knew from the town
she used to Iive in.

528
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:47,684
She mention his name?
MANDY: No.

529
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:50,917
But a couple of days
Iater she was gone.

530
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,516
What night was that,
that she, uh, saw the guy?

531
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:56,358
It was a week ago,
Iast Tuesday. Um...

532
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,163
I remember it 'cause that was
the night I introduced
the cockatoo into my act.

533
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:02,863
Okay. Thank you.

534
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:07,064
Hey, nail the prick,
will you?

535
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:08,768
We'II do our best.

536
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:12,870
Let's check
the credit card receipts,
see who came in here from Rye.

537
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:16,178
Mr. Rizzo, you're quite
a big spender over there
at Benny's Topless.

538
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:17,718
Look, you can't tell my wife.

539
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:19,309
She thinks I work
a Iot of overtime.

540
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:20,647
Well, so help us out here,

541
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:23,054
we won't have to
take a drive up to Rye
and talk to you at home.

542
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:24,853
Whatever you need.

543
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:26,052
You know Dan Hoffman?

544
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,422
Yeah.
He's a great guy.

545
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:30,063
I handle a Iot
of his closings
out of my office in Rye.

546
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:33,259
Did you take Hoffman
to the strip club,
you know, boys night out?

547
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:35,268
No, but I tried.

548
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:37,337
Especially after
I saw that stripper.

549
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:38,804
She's a dead ringer
for his wife.

550
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:40,704
Did you tell Hoffman
about this stripper?

551
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:44,370
I called him on my way home,
you know, thought he'd get
a kick out of it.

552
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:48,939
Put her in an apron
baking cookies, half the town
would swear it was Jill.

553
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,518
No one spotted Dan Hoffman
in the strip club,

554
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:56,317
but he didn't have to
go inside the joint.

555
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:57,415
Once he knew
where Jill worked,

556
00:25:57,492 --> 00:25:59,153
it would've been easy enough
to follow her home.

557
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:01,695
The night of
the dinner dance,
he slips out, he kills her.

558
00:26:01,763 --> 00:26:03,355
I mean, it's almost
the perfect crime,

559
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:06,696
except for the fact that
his alibi has a hole
you can drive a truck through.

560
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:09,896
Nobody at the dance
remembers seeing him
for a full 45 minutes.

561
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:12,496
So,
what do you say, Counselor,
we got probable cause?

562
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:15,236
It's all circumstantial,
but it's enough
for an arrest.

563
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,937
Well, don't Iook so happy.

564
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:19,036
We may not survive
the grand jury.

565
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:20,570
Why not?

566
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:22,081
Dan Hoffman will testify.

567
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,777
His father-of-the-year act
has everybody fooled.

568
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:29,221
He's handsome, charismatic,
and he plays the grieving
widower very well.

569
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,919
I think Mr. Wonderful is
going to dirty up the victim
and the jury might not indict.

570
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:34,791
Stop him from testifying.

571
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:37,956
I can't.
Once he's arrested,
it's his right.

572
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:40,330
His attorney
will serve notice
at arraignment.

573
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:42,028
So we're stuck.

574
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:45,095
I could do
a silent indictment
without arresting him.

575
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,164
If I present
the facts to the grand jury

576
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,505
as part of an investigation
into the homicide,

577
00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:51,636
I'm not obligated
to notify Hoffman.

578
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:55,114
If the defense is out of
the Ioop, then Hoffman can't
assert his right to testify.

579
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:58,710
I'II indict him
in the morning.
Then you can pick him up.

580
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:00,915
BENSON: Tommy.

581
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:03,714
How you doing?

582
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,726
Tommy, come back inside.

583
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:10,456
Come on, buddy, you gotta
pick out which video
we're gonna watch.

584
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:14,228
How about you show me
some of those soccer moves.
Come on.

585
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:16,099
AII right. That's it,
I'm calling my attorney.

586
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,968
Gonna file a restraining order
against you both
and then sue for harassment.

587
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,873
You wanna make a call?
Tell her to meet you
at Rikers. Turn around.

588
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:24,036
You can't prove anything.
Turn around.

589
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:27,007
The grand jury disagrees.

590
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:30,915
Dan Hoffman, you're
under arrest for the murder
of Jill Hoffman.

591
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:32,680
You have the right
to remain silent.

592
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,515
If you give up that right...

593
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:37,820
It's okay.
It's okay, Tommy.

594
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:42,090
"Indictment number 4319,
People v. Daniel Hoffman.

595
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:43,528
"Murder in the Second Degree."

596
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:44,826
How does the defendant plead?

597
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,228
Not guilty.

598
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,029
CABOT: The People
request remand, Your Honor.

599
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:51,037
My client is
a community Ieader
with no criminal record

600
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,936
and the sole
caretaker of his son.

601
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,669
Well, he wouldn't
be a single parent
if he hadn't killed his wife.

602
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,210
Control yourself, Ms. Cabot.

603
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:59,542
Bail is $100,000,
cash or bond.

604
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:01,172
We request
a speedy trial date.

605
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:03,479
My client is eager to
prove his innocence,

606
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:06,611
an opportunity the A.D.A.
denied him
in the grand jury.

607
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:08,918
The district attorney
is under no obligation
to inform him...

608
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,391
I know the Iaw, Ms. Cabot,
I also know your
reputation for bending it.

609
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,055
"A child's mental
health is at risk."
Your words.

610
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,098
We didn't want to
further traumatize
Tommy Hoffman

611
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,066
by having his father
arrested prematurely.

612
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:21,158
RIDENOUR: Anything else?

613
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:23,795
Motion to preclude
any witnesses stating

614
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:27,034
that Jill Hoffman told them
she'd been abused.

615
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,905
CABOT: Jill Hoffman was
emotionally distraught

616
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,967
when she spoke
to the domestic violence
shelter staff.

617
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:32,637
Her remarks clearly qualify

618
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:35,148
under the excited
utterance exception
to the hearsay rule.

619
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:36,410
But, Your Honor,
admitting them

620
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:38,611
violates my client's
constitutional right

621
00:28:38,686 --> 00:28:41,587
to confront and
cross-examine his accuser.

622
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:43,351
It's unduly prejudicial.

623
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:46,120
Those statements
are a key element
of my case.

624
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:49,129
Well, your case
is in trouble.
Motion granted.

625
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:51,196
We're screwed.

626
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:52,698
The defense will argue
that Jill Hoffman

627
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:55,327
was murdered
during a home invasion
gone bad.

628
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:58,167
There's no evidence
Dan Hoffman can use
to support that claim.

629
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,298
But there's nothing
to disprove it, either.

630
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:03,605
Jill Iived in
an unsafe neighborhood,
and she worked as a stripper.

631
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:04,702
She was at a high risk.

632
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:06,747
Tommy's testimony
would convict Hoffman.

633
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,578
You give me a chance
and I know that

634
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:09,911
that kid will tell
me what happened.

635
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,849
Kid's been in foster care
since Hoffman's arrest.

636
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,181
OIivia can go interview him.

637
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:16,485
Judge Ridenour's order
not to talk to Tommy
is still in effect.

638
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:18,718
Even if Tommy says
his dad killed Jill,

639
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:21,660
his statement would be
precluded because we
disobeyed the court's ruling.

640
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,890
You could subpoena
Tommy for the trial.

641
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:25,899
It's a hell of a gamble
to put a traumatized child

642
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:27,832
on the stand unprepared.

643
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:31,531
Besides, Hoffman may have
coached Tommy to say
that a stranger did it.

644
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:34,166
What about his
biological mother?
She has rights to talk to him.

645
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:37,268
Kim Hoffman?
Yeah, well, either she
fell into a black hole,

646
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:38,642
or he murdered her, too.

647
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,578
Now guess
where I'm placing
my money on that one?

648
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:43,344
So far, no signs of activity
on her social security,

649
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:46,818
no tax returns
since she disappeared,
no signs of Iife.

650
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:49,880
Find somebody who knew
the first Mrs. Hoffman.

651
00:29:53,594 --> 00:29:56,791
Mr. Wheaten, how Iong have
you Iived across the street
from the Hoffmans?

652
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,059
Ten years,
before they moved in.

653
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:01,693
STABLER: Did you know his
first wife, Kim?

654
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:03,669
Sure, but just to say hello.

655
00:30:03,738 --> 00:30:05,433
You know,
we have been all over town

656
00:30:05,506 --> 00:30:07,736
and nobody seems to know
Kim Hoffman well.

657
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:09,367
Well, I'm not surprised.

658
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:12,139
Her husband had her terrified
to talk to anyone.

659
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:14,875
I'd see her outside, wave,

660
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:15,938
she'd Iook over her shoulder

661
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:18,679
to make sure
he wasn't watching
before she'd wave back.

662
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,687
Did you ever
see him hurt Kim?

663
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:24,088
Kim always had bruises,
one time a broken arm.

664
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,757
She said she'd tripped
over the stroller.

665
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:28,523
Did he ever say
anything after she Ieft?

666
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:30,188
That she'd run off
with another man.

667
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:31,754
I didn't believe it.

668
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,425
BENSON: So what do you
think really happened?

669
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,093
Hoffman killed her,
of course.

670
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,863
Especially after
I saw the black van.

671
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:40,507
BIack van?
What van?

672
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:42,575
It pulled in Iate at night.

673
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:47,080
I saw this shadowy figure
fill it with garbage bags,
then drive away.

674
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:49,048
Next day, Kim was gone.

675
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:52,911
I called the cops,
gave them the Iicense plate.

676
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:54,881
Dan Hoffman's not a killer.

677
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:56,083
Well, did you investigate
Kim Hoffman's disappearance?

678
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:57,489
Did you check on
the neighbor's tip?

679
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,151
Oh, you've been talking
to Mr. Neighborhood Watch.

680
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:00,525
Wheaten thinks he's Columbo.

681
00:31:00,596 --> 00:31:02,757
Did you run the plates?

682
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:05,231
Harry, would you please pull
the Kim Hoffman file?

683
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,997
Look, we may not be
the almighty NYPD,
but we do our jobs.

684
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:12,063
Someone reports a murder,
we check it out,
even if the guy's a crackpot.

685
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,406
So, yes, we ran the plates.
Yes, they came back
to a Dawn Trent.

686
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:19,413
Soccer mom, Port Chester.
Yes, she was there.

687
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:20,778
Delivering Girl
Scout cookies.

688
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:22,077
May I?

689
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,517
The case is closed.
You want the file,
you're welcome to it.

690
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:26,781
Thanks.

691
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:31,721
I'II brief Cabot,
see if we can get
her to stall the trial.

692
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:35,752
And I'II try and find
Dawn Trent. She's got
a Iot of questions to answer.

693
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:40,767
I don't know Dan Hoffman.
I already told
the Rye Police.

694
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:42,064
It must be some mistake.

695
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:43,866
Nice home you have here.

696
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:45,031
You seem to be a nice mom.

697
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:47,598
Lady Iike you
is not the usual
accessory to murder.

698
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:48,768
Murder?

699
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:52,371
We're re-investigating
the disappearance
of Kim Hoffman.

700
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:55,072
I'm sorry,
I don't even know her.

701
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,174
STABLER: You're a Iiar.

702
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:58,310
Lady, we've got a witness
who places you there,

703
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:00,947
at their house,
the night Kim disappeared.

704
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:04,918
Where'd you stash the body?

705
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:08,887
I don't know Dan Hoffman.

706
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:11,426
But I do know Kim.

707
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:15,599
I was there that night,
helping her Ieave.

708
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:17,229
Kim's alive?

709
00:32:17,306 --> 00:32:20,434
Oh, she wouldn't be now
if I hadn't gotten her out.

710
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:22,773
It's the same old story,
Detective.

711
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:25,244
Your husband's
the nicest guy in town,

712
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:27,976
pals with everybody,
including the cops,

713
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,944
but every night
when he comes home,
he beats you.

714
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:33,453
He degrades you.
He terrorizes you.

715
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:36,719
Who's gonna believe
that the Man of the Year
is a batterer?

716
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:39,693
And you can't Ieave him,
there's nowhere to go.

717
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:41,285
He'II find you.
He always does.

718
00:32:41,363 --> 00:32:43,354
There's nowhere to
hide in a small town.

719
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:47,458
The only way
is to get far away
and start over.

720
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,998
But that takes money.
And help.

721
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:53,902
And that's what you provide.

722
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:55,409
Well, it's not just me.

723
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:57,609
There's a group of us.

724
00:32:58,313 --> 00:33:00,804
What is this,
some kind of DV
underground railroad?

725
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:02,782
You could call it that.

726
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:05,752
I was Kim's first stop,
and then I passed her
on to another helper.

727
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:08,255
You grabbed her
and took her away.

728
00:33:08,557 --> 00:33:09,888
Why not the kid?

729
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:13,724
(SIGHS) Kim was going to die,
Detective. We had to move.

730
00:33:14,997 --> 00:33:16,430
Her hope was that
she could come back

731
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:18,261
for Tommy when she'd
gotten herself together.

732
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,133
I need to talk to Kim.

733
00:33:20,202 --> 00:33:22,170
Well,
I don't know where she is.

734
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:25,331
AII any of us know
is the next
Iink in the chain.

735
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,671
I picked Kim Hoffman up
from the bus station.

736
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:29,142
From there,
we drove to Poughkeepsie.

737
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:30,576
After that...

738
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:33,205
Kim was Iiving on a farm
outside of Woodstock.

739
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:35,476
I helped her move
to New Paltz.

740
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,780
Then I heard she moved
to Brewster.

741
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:40,117
I got her settled
in Torrington.

742
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:44,090
The Iast I heard
she was still there,
working in a dry cleaner's.

743
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:48,723
Thank you, sir.
Have a nice day.

744
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:50,264
Can I help you?

745
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:51,924
Yeah.
I need to talk to you, Kim.

746
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,135
I'm sorry, you must
have me mistaken for
someone else. My name is...

747
00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:56,500
Kim Hoffman.

748
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:58,105
No, it's not.

749
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,401
It's about Tommy.

750
00:34:05,714 --> 00:34:07,011
Is Tommy okay?

751
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:08,572
Physically, yeah.

752
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:12,175
He needs you.

(SIGHS)

754
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:18,083
I cry for him every night.

755
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:24,428
You must think
I'm a terrible mother
for Ieaving him.

756
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:26,330
I know why you Ieft.

757
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,232
Nobody knows how bad it was.

758
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:34,675
Dan used to
beat me so severely
that I couldn't walk.

759
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,574
I had to get out.

760
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:40,247
Once I was safe,
I was gonna go
back for Tommy.

761
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:41,646
Why didn't you?

762
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,148
I did.

763
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:49,119
Once I was settled,
I went back to Rye.

764
00:34:52,194 --> 00:34:56,130
I saw him playing
in the front yard
with some woman.

765
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:57,961
He called her Mommy.

766
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:03,331
(SOBBING)

767
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:08,538
He Iooked so happy.

768
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:13,179
I thought he was better off.

769
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,910
He had everything
I couldn't give him.

770
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,281
I can't face him.

771
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:24,121
I can't face him.
Yeah, you can.

772
00:35:24,192 --> 00:35:25,625
He'II never understand
why I Ieft.

773
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:27,093
He'II never understand.

774
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:28,652
What if he
doesn't Iove me anymore?

775
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,163
What if he doesn't...

776
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:31,699
Listen to me.

777
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:36,201
Your ex-husband is
about to be acquitted.

778
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:41,265
If you don't help Tommy,
he goes back to that house.

779
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:44,540
You have to risk your
pain to save his Iife.

780
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:57,284
Jill worked in my office.

781
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,624
She was so kind
to me when Kim Ieft.

782
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:03,358
She offered to cook dinner
for Tommy and me, babysit.

783
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:05,525
So she pursued you?

784
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:08,399
I was on the rebound.
She was a beautiful woman,
I was flattered.

785
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:11,599
Did the relationship change
after the wedding?

786
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:15,576
I saw another side of Jill.
She had a terrible temper.

787
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:18,113
One night I didn't praise
her cooking enough,

788
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:20,775
and she smashed the meatloaf
all over the walls.

789
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,647
Tommy was terrified.

790
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:27,111
I just realized
that she was
emotionally unstable.

791
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:30,585
I begged her to get help.
She refused.

792
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,187
I just hoped with
enough Iove and support
that things would change.

793
00:36:34,263 --> 00:36:35,560
CHANEY: And did they?

794
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:36,995
HOFFMAN: Jill got worse.

795
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:40,001
I was afraid
that she was
gonna hurt Tommy,

796
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:43,869
so I told her that
I wanted a divorce,

797
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,340
and she said
she would make me pay.

798
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,435
The next day,
I came home, she was gone.

799
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:52,743
I mean, she'd Ieft before,
but only for a day or two.

800
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:58,048
And I was... I was relieved,
until Tommy didn't
come home from school.

801
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:03,586
And then I realized
that she had
taken him with her.

802
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:08,596
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

803
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:14,565
So you're the victim here,
Mr. Hoffman.

804
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:16,104
My son was taken from me.

805
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:18,265
You have no idea
what I went through

806
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:20,534
wondering if
Tommy was all right.

807
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,237
You Iove your son
very much, don't you?

808
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,005
Yes, I do.

809
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,709
Then explain why
you never filed
a missing persons report.

810
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:31,051
I was afraid to go to
the police. I mean...

811
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:35,718
I thought that Jill
might do something crazy
if she were cornered.

812
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,315
So you didn't
go Iook for them?

813
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,018
Of course I did.

814
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:42,826
But when a neighbor told you
that a woman bearing
an uncanny resemblance to Jill

815
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:45,025
was working at
Benny's Topless,
you didn't go check?

816
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:47,695
I never thought that
that could be true.

817
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,330
Jill was so shy
she wouldn't even
make Iove with the Iights on.

818
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:53,842
So it's a total coincidence
that within days of hearing
about the strip club,

819
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,706
your wife was
brutally murdered.

820
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:59,509
I wish that I would have
gone there. I wish that
I would have found her.

821
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:02,779
If I had,
Tommy would have been
home safe with me,

822
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:06,878
not watching
Jill get murdered
by some maniac.

823
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:15,661
Here.
Thank you.

824
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:34,045
Tommy.

825
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:39,718
Do you know who I am?

826
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:43,320
You're my real mom.

827
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,027
You remember me?

828
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,999
I have your picture.

829
00:38:55,037 --> 00:38:56,937
You missed my birthday.

830
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,075
I know.

831
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,005
I know and I'm so sorry.

832
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:09,081
But I saw your
soccer playoffs Iast year,

833
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:11,584
when you scored
that big goal.

834
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:12,814
You did?

835
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:14,115
Oh, yeah.

836
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:17,322
I cheered my heart out.

837
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:21,062
Then why didn't you
come and see me?

838
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:25,356
I was scared.

839
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:27,701

00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:29,236
Yes, honey.

He scares me a Iot.

842
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:35,407
Me, too.

No.

845
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:49,481
No, I will never
ever go away again.
