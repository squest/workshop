00:00:03,306 --> 00:00:05,069
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:08,804
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:10,140
In New York City,

4
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:13,011
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:16,574
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:18,620
These are their stories.

7
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:20,778
(SIREN BLARING)

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,785
He robbed me.
Guy came in to rob me.

9
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:27,955
Take it easy, take it easy.
Did you see where he went?

10
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,999
Cops chased him
into the alley.

11
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,055
(GUN FIRING)

12
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,228
Get back inside!
Get down!

13
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:36,066
OFFICER TAYLOR: Police!
Drop it or you're dead. Now!

14
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:37,436
Bailey! Taylor!

15
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:38,599
Where are you guys?

16
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:40,699
OFFICER BAILEY:
Over here! We got him.

17
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:44,344
Two-two-Henry.
SIow everyone down.
We got one under.

18
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:45,472
Anyone hit?

19
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:47,277
Just this mutt.
Winged him in the arm.

20
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,318
Bus is on the way.
Here's his piece.

21
00:00:50,987 --> 00:00:53,012
Hey, guys, you better
check this out.

22
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:54,317
What?

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:56,889
Oh, man.

24
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:00,126
She's dead.

25
00:01:03,132 --> 00:01:04,997
Police, coming through.
Thank you.

26
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:06,659
Hey.

27
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:11,061
Kind of strange,
Cragen calling us in on
an officer-involved shooting.

28
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,700
Maybe not.
Look who's
over there.

29
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:15,073
STABLER: Swell.

30
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:16,839
Stabler, Benson,
thanks for coming.

31
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:19,473
Yeah. It's the middle
of the night. I hope you're
not jerking us around.

32
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,914
I'm not.

33
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:24,180
I've got a black
female teenager,
sleeping on the streets.

34
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:27,780
We think she's a runaway,
then somebody
worked her over.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,918
Burn marks, both arms.

36
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:37,533
Braids, ribbon in her hair,
covered by
a pretty decent blanket.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,763
Yeah, and a big hole
in her head.

38
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,402
Not your average
homeless kid.

39
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:45,566
Maybe not,
but she's an
abuse victim.

40
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:48,073
We think the perp
shot her.

41
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:50,635
No, you think the cops
accidentally shot her,

42
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:53,682
and you're trying to pull us
into your own mess by calling
it an SVU case.

43
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:57,185
This girl was tortured
and we have no idea
who she is.

44
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:59,312
You want her parents
to see her face
in the morning news?

45
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:00,855
That's your problem,
not ours.

46
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:03,949
Come on, SVU knows
how to protect victims
and deal with families.

47
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,823
You mean you want us
to keep this under wraps.

48
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,523
We want this to Iook clean
from the beginning.

49
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,293
So I'm asking
for a favor.

50
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:14,402
AII the times that
you people at IAB
jammed us up

51
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,494
and now you
want to play nice?

52
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,539
You've got a set of balls
on you asking us for anything.

53
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:19,165
If we find out that
a cop shot that girl,

54
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,766
you expect us
to keep it quiet?

55
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:23,107
I expect you
to do your job.

56
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,306
However this turns out,
it turns out.

57
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:29,074
You don't want to
do it for me, fine.

58
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,779
Do it for her.

59
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,701
Found seven slugs,

60
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:30,905
all of them too badly
damaged for any
microscopic work.

61
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,140
Shell casings?

62
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:34,615
Had better Iuck there.
Matched them to each weapon.

63
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,811
Well, they were all carrying
nines, so the casings would
have gone

64
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:38,615
about 10 feet to the right
and a Iittle to the rear.

65
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:40,656
So we know
approximately where
each person fired from.

66
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,588
Number one
is Officer Bailey,

67
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,424
two is the perp
and Officer Taylor
is number three.

68
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:50,363
The bullet passed
through this steel drum
before hitting the victim,

69
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:53,027
making a trajectory
through two fixed points.

70
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:57,198
The ballistic alignment Iaser
will tell us for sure
who shot her.

71
00:03:57,273 --> 00:04:00,470
They all fired on the run,
so it could have been
any one of them.

72
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:02,807
And there's
our bullet path.

73
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,474
Hal, you be Officer Taylor.
Benson, you take Bailey.
Stabler, you're the perp.

74
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,212
We'II see where
the Iaser Iands.

75
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:11,947
EI, it's on you.

76
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:16,314
The perp fired the shot
that killed the girl.

77
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:21,456
Only problem is, your Jane Doe
was already dead when the perp
shot her.

78
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,656
That son-of-a-bitch
Iucked out.

79
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,996
The cops at the scene
said she was still warm.

80
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,364
So did my assistants.

81
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:27,766
But by the time
they got her back here,

82
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:29,702
her Iower extremities
were already stiff.

83
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:30,761
She was going into rigor.

84
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,207
Well, she had to be
dead four or five hours
before the shooting, then.

85
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:35,505
That's about right.

86
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:37,068
Do you know
what killed her?

87
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,376
Hopefully we'II find out
when I open her up.

88
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,246
But she was filthy,
Iike she hadn't
bathed in weeks.

89
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:44,718
I have her personal effects
to put into evidence.

90
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:46,414
STABLER: Anything good?

91
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:48,980
Just some cheap clothes
from one of your
better discount stores.

92
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,389
And this necklace.

93
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:53,821
That's an infinity
symbol on a chain.

94
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,887
What's up
with these burns?

95
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:59,799
That's what they Iook Iike,
but they're actually
cockroach bites.

96
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,336
Well, if she was homeless,

97
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:04,373
she could have gotten them
from Iiving on the street
or after she died.

98
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,102
Except the bites
wouldn't swell if
she was dead.

99
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,906
And the roaches wouldn't bite
unless she was immobile.

100
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,776
You're thinking
she was restrained?

101
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:13,872
Or so sick
she couldn't move.

102
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:18,348
It sounds Iike this
girl was held captive
in a very unpleasant place.

103
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:19,410
And then dumped at the scene.

104
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:20,819
Lab checked the ground
where the girl was found.

105
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,517
No evidence of
any bodily fluids.

106
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,719
So, if she was already dead,
the new blanket is
a care-giving gesture.

107
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:28,559
The same reason as the hair
ribbons. Whoever Ieft her
there Ioved her.

108
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,098
MUNCH: We've got an ID.

109
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,565
And you're not
gonna believe it.

110
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,659
Who is she?
Samantha Tassler.

111
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,431
The girl who
disappeared from Philly?

112
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:38,632
FIN: Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania, to be exact.

113
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:41,135
Less than
eight months ago.

114
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,872
Didn't we spend, Iike,
two weeks Iast year
searching for her?

115
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,675
Maybe three.
Are they sure
it's her?

116
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:47,306
Cops there say our
photo matches theirs.

117
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:49,578
The parents are
coming in tonight.

118
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:53,179
Her friend's older brother
was supposed to drive
her home.

119
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:57,055
We called when it got Iate
and Samantha hadn't
come back yet.

120
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:01,596
That's when we find
out she never got there.

121
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:05,600
We have some of Samantha's
personal effects
when she was found.

122
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:08,967
It would help us if you
could take a Iook at them.
Are you up for that?

123
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:20,681
I ain't never
seen this.

124
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:26,617
I don't recognize
this necklace, either.

125
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,520
Sharon, did you buy
this for Samantha?

126
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:29,751
SHARON: No.

127
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:33,391
Are you sure that she
didn't have this one
when she was home?

128
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,159
Positive.

129
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:40,766
You found her on the street.
I'm surprised
she still had this necklace.

130
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:43,396
It's solid platinum.
It's probably worth
close to a grand.

131
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:45,736
The girl's wearing
dime store clothes
and Iiving on the street.

132
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:48,038
It doesn't make sense
she wouldn't have
sold this for food money.

133
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,304
You have any idea
where this came from?

134
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:52,347
You're not going to find it
in a case at Tiffany's or
any other mainstream retailer.

135
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,507
Here, have a Iook.

136
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,152
I don't notice anything
unusual about it.

137
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,119
The X-ray
fluorescence test did.

138
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,917
It's coated in rhodium
to make it shine

139
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,981
instead of the regular
polishing and finishing.

140
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:04,855
That hasn't been popular
in this country in decades.

141
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:06,895
So?
So, it's definitely
handmade.

142
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:08,589
And there are
three tiny initials
engraved on the back.

143
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:09,790
I just put it
in our database.

144
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:10,923
What are you
checking?

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Every jeweler in the Tri-State
who makes his own jewelry
with the three initials RSC.

146
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,030
Any hits?

147
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:17,470
Yeah, here we go.

148
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,304
Ross St. CIair.
Got a Iittle shop
down in the Village.

149
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:25,478
No, I don't
remember her.

150
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:29,647
I don't get a Iot of
teenagers in my store.

151
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:31,515
My jewelry's
too expensive.

152
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:35,723
What about this?
How much does something
Iike this run you?

153
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,419
Eight hundred bucks.
It's custom-made.

154
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:40,456
Something happen to her?

155
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,757
Actually,
she's dead.

156
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,698
Geez. And she was
wearing my Infinity?

157
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:48,768
That's why we're here.
Who'd you make it for?

158
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:50,100
Garret Lang.

159
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,367
Who's he?
Regular customer.

160
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:54,500
He sent his assistant
over with a drawing.

161
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,805
Come on.

162
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,113
You know, I usually
make my own stuff,

163
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:02,241
but this guy,
he orders
a hundred of them.

164
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:04,479
Gave me 80 grand
up front.

165
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:06,145
Where can we
find this Lang?

166
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:11,785
He Ieft me a stack of business
cards to hand out to my
better-paying customers.

167
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,497
LANG: It's the symbol
of eternal Iife.

168
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,590
I give the necklace
to all my patients.

169
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,033
STABLER: At $800 a piece,
that's an expensive gift.

170
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:23,594
What exactly do you
treat them for?

171
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:26,766
You're what,
early 40s, right,
Detective?

172
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,571
Late 30s, why?

173
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:31,670
Do you ever feel that
your stamina's declining?

174
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:34,341
That you don't have
the energy you used to
or that you've Iost your edge?

175
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,906
No, but Iet's say
that I was.

176
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:37,350
Well, then,
I would put you on a course

177
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,444
of human growth hormone
and testosterone therapy.

178
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:43,822
I guarantee you'd be
a new man in the squad room,
not to mention the bedroom.

179
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:47,889
But you didn't come here
to hear me pontificate.

180
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:49,760
How can I help you?

181
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,628
You ever seen her?

182
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,259
I don't think so.

183
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,827
Well, are you sure
that she's not one
of your patients?

184
00:08:56,906 --> 00:09:00,273
Human growth hormone is used
to treat children of short
stature, Detectives,

185
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:04,073
but that's not what I do here
and I don't treat children.

186
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:06,307
Well, what about
Dr. Foy?

187
00:09:06,382 --> 00:09:09,579
There is no Dr. Foy.
It stands for
Fountain of Youth.

188
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:11,813
Why would you think
that I would
know your victim?

189
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:16,017
Well, because when she was
found, your infinity symbol
was hanging around her neck.

190
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:18,719
My God.
What happened?

191
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,921
BENSON: That's what we're
trying to find out.

192
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:24,122
My patients who
wear the necklace

193
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:26,360
tell me that
people often ask them
where they can get one.

194
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,596
Any chance we can get
a Iist of those patients?

195
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:30,696
Detectives, you know
that it would be unethical

196
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:33,640
as well as illegal for me
to give you that information.

197
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:38,274
Lang's summa cum Iaude
from Stanford,
MD and PhD from Yale,

198
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,975
residency in OBG/GYN
with a fellowship

199
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,848
in infertility and
reproductive endocrinology.

200
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,752
That's big credentials to be
running some feel-good clinic.

201
00:09:46,822 --> 00:09:48,517
He was one of the top
researchers in his field

202
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:50,582
until he Ieft academia
to open up shop.

203
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,890
Guy's had Iots of
magazine articles
written about him.

204
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,989
CIaims hormones can
reverse the aging process.

205
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:00,263
The guy's a chick magnet
for the society set.

206
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:02,736
Sounds Iike the Iunatic
fringe of medicine.

207
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:04,568
Well, it makes you feel good.
What's wrong with that?

208
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,801
That's the same excuse
people use to get high.

209
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,639
The doc's nothing more
than a dealer with a Iicense.

210
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:11,646
MUNCH: What he's doing
is perfectly Iegal.

211
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:13,841
Don't tell me you're thinking
about taking this stuff?

212
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,350
I've considered it.
And why shouldn't I add
some Iean muscle

213
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:19,353
to what you so
Iovingly call
"my bony ass"?

214
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:23,289
You can hit a gym
when we close this case.
Otherwise, everybody, focus.

215
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
I mean,
what's Lang Iooking for
in a 14-year-old girl?

216
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:28,691
If he's a pedophile,
maybe his own
fountain of youth.

217
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:32,063
Well, there's nothing other
than that infinity necklace
to tie him to Samantha.

218
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:35,262
And there's no way to prove
that she didn't get it from
one of his patients.

219
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:36,861
And we can't find
out who they are.

220
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,065
What about the autopsy?

221
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,438
It's backlogged.
Internal exam's
not done yet.

222
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:43,706
Well, then,
wait at the M.E.'s
office until it is.

223
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,306
I found traces of facial
tissue and dried saliva
on her right cheek,

224
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:48,611
which we're testing for DNA.

225
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:51,084
So it sounds Iike
somebody was with
her before she died.

226
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:52,586
Can we rule this
a homicide yet?

227
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:54,020
I need more
information.

228
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,388
But I can tell you that
Samantha died of a blood
clot to her Ieft Iung.

229
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:58,551
Caused by?

230
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,151
Severe dehydration.

231
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:04,666
I'd say she was deprived
of fluids for between
five and 10 days.

232
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,564
Turned her blood to sludge.

233
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:09,195
Well, it supports the theory
that somebody Iocked her away.

234
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:11,068
That's probably where
she got those
cockroach bites.

235
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,266
That makes sense.

236
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:15,276
What I found when
I examined her
reproductive organs doesn't.

237
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,675
BENSON: How so?

238
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:18,337
When a woman goes through
her menstrual cycle,

239
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:20,177
one, maybe two eggs
are released,

240
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,274
Ieaving the follicles
where the eggs
came from empty.

241
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:24,751
And something was wrong
with Samantha's ovaries?

242
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,220
She had 12 visibly
involuted follicles.

243
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:30,190
That means 12 eggs
all released at
the same time.

244
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,658
I've never seen that
in a 14-year-old.

245
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:35,288
But I thought
women were most fertile
in their teenage years.

246
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:40,267
Usually this only happens
when the ovaries are
hyperstimulated by hormones,

247
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:42,735
Iike, for in vitro
fertilization.

248
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:44,534
So, assuming that
she even wanted to,

249
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:47,268
why does a 14-year-old girl
need help getting pregnant?

250
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:50,971
I don't know. But whatever
the reason, it worked.

251
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:53,276
Samantha was carrying
an eight-week-old fetus.

252
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,386
CABOT: You can't prove
Samantha Tassler
even knew Garret Lang.

253
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:01,582
She was wearing
his necklace.

254
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:03,682
A trinket she could
have gotten anywhere
does not help me.

255
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,956
The guy's an infertility
specialist, he's a big wheel
in hormone research.

256
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,463
Now, can you think of a better
candidate to help Samantha
get pregnant?

257
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:10,896
I wouldn't want to
argue that in court.

258
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,991
AIex, we know that
it's circumstantial,

259
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,662
but this guy had to
have something to do
with Samantha's death.

260
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:18,070
I cannot get
an arrest warrant
based on supposition.

261
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,869
You have to find
me a direct Iink.

262
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:21,307
So give us something
that we can work with,

263
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:24,004
subpoenas for his financials,
phone records
and a patient Iist.

264
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,741
No judge is going to give
us a Iook at a doctor's
patient Iist.

265
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,407
But the rest is doable.

266
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:30,645
I can also get you
a Iook at his IRS records.

267
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,820
This guy doesn't have
one phone Iisted
in his own name.

268
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,950
AII under the corporation,
Infinity Partners.

269
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:42,122
This is gonna take a week
to trace who made all these
calls to and from his clinic.

270
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:44,688
That voodoo medicine
he practices pays big bucks.

271
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:48,259
Between his personal
and corporate accounts,
he's got almost five mil cash.

272
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:50,362
His real estate holdings
are worth at Ieast
five times that.

273
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,236
He owns his building
and three brownstones

274
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:55,799
and get this,
he's applying for tax-exempt
status on one of them.

275
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,206
Let me see that.

276
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:00,642
What's he claiming?

277
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:02,775
Charitable organization.

278
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:05,342
"Foundation for
Knowledge Expansion."

279
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,822
Application says
it's a non-profit

280
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:12,793
educational enrichment
program for young women
at risk.

281
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:14,488
Where?

282
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:15,655
Chelsea.

283
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,256
I wonder if he's
enriching these girls
Iike he did Samantha.

284
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:23,600
BENSON:
There's three more girls.

285
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:27,301
They don't Iook Iike
your typical street kids
at risk.

286
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:29,810
That makes four
going in so far.

287
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:31,539
And there's
another one.

288
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:35,006
STABLER: Just Iike
all the others.

289
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:38,382
I've seen
that girl before.

290
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,318
Her face Iook
familiar to you?

291
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,782
STABLER: Yeah. That girl
from the posters on
the Upper East Side.

292
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,761
You shorten her hair and you
change it back to dark brown,
that's Jessica Morse.

293
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,628
Disappeared about
the same time as Samantha,
presumed kidnapped.

294
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,826
What the hell
did we step into?

295
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:05,041
Can I help you?
Police department.

296
00:14:05,113 --> 00:14:07,081
I... I didn't call
the police.
Where's Jessica Morse?

297
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,377
I don't know who
you're talking about.

298
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,747
She just walked in here.
Step aside.

299
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:12,651
Excuse me, please!
You can't do this.
You have no right to do this.

300
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:15,246
We have every right.
This is a girl who's been
missing since Iast year.

301
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:16,450
EIIiot.
What is this?

302
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:21,485
This is my school.
I am a Iicensed teacher.
These are my students.

303
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,030
How did they
get here?

304
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:27,166
I find them on the streets.
We run a foundation.

305
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:30,967
For knowledge expansion.
Yeah, we know all about that.
Who are you?

306
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:33,505
I'm Paula Haggerty.

307
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:37,473
We give them a safe place
to Iive, we give them food,
we give them education.

308
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,707
And these kids are going
back to their parents.

309
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,146
Mrs. Haggerty,
you're under arrest.

310
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,911
Is this really
necessary?

311
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:46,682
Oh, that's a nice tattoo you
have here on your Ieft wrist.
An infinity symbol.

312
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,689
For infinite potential.

313
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,882
I would Iike to call
a Iawyer, please.

314
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,722
You can do that
at our precinct.

315
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,863
Can I talk
to you a minute?

316
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:58,194
Why?

317
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:03,336
"Why"? Because you
Iook a Iot Iike a girl
who disappeared Iast year.

318
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,100
I'm not who you
think I am.

319
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:08,108
Jessica, your family
wants you back.

320
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:13,277
My name is Marjorie
and this is my family.

321
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:17,982
My client should be Iauded
for what she's done,
not arrested.

322
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,544
Your client kept
five 14-year-olds

323
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:23,523
whose parents reported them
as kidnapped or runaways.

324
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:25,924
I was just trying
to help them.

325
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:28,758
They Ieft home because
their parents
mistreated them.

326
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,559
And you know this how?

327
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:33,601
Mrs. Haggerty has a master's
in child psychology.

328
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:37,161
Well, then, she understands
that just because a teenager
disagrees with her parents

329
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,104
doesn't mean the parents
did something wrong.

330
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:41,233
Who pays your salary,
Mrs. Haggerty?

331
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,335
JOAN: The foundation's
board of directors.

332
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:45,642
The funds come from
charitable contributions.

333
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,581
Well, Dr. Garrett Lang
owns the building.
So he on the board, too?

334
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,949
No. He started the foundation
and provided the initial
endowment.

335
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:56,216
But he has no other dealings
with the foundation
or the employees or clients.

336
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:56,260
Was she one of your clients,
Mrs. Haggerty?

337
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:00,094
I never saw
this girl before.

338
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:03,157
I'd Iike to know
what charges, if any,
are forthcoming?

339
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:04,826
Let's start
with kidnapping.

340
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:07,868
Can I get you something
to eat or drink?

341
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:09,964
I'm not hungry.
When can I go?

342
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,633
Your parents are
coming here to get you.

343
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:16,603
Jessica, they've missed you
very much. They can't wait
to see you.

344
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:20,617
I've told you,
my name is not Jessica.
It's Marjorie Maddox.

345
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:26,212
Jessica, we both know
this is a picture of you.

346
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,859
When I talked to your mom,
she said you'd
missed your birthday.

347
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:36,799
Your family can't wait for you
to come home, they want
to celebrate it with you.

348
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:41,171
You cannot believe
how sad they were.

349
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,332
They thought you were
never gonna come home.

350
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:48,742
Okay. Hey, Jessica.

351
00:16:49,848 --> 00:16:52,043
Come on,
it's gonna be okay.

352
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:55,047
No, it's not.

353
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,651
Mrs. Haggerty's going to be
so worried about me.

354
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:01,055
I have to go
back to her.

355
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:04,152
You're 14 years old.
You belong with your parents.

356
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:08,165
I belong with Mrs. Haggerty.
Can't you see that?

357
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,304
I know everybody thinks
that I was kidnapped.

358
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:16,604
But I ran away.

359
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,937
You did? Why?

360
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,808
Because my parents...

361
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,644
Oh, they didn't
understand me.

362
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:27,150
Mrs. Haggerty does?

363
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,810
Yes.

364
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,114
She saved my Iife.

365
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,054
She did?
How'd she do that?

366
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:35,820
She took me in
off the street.

367
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:38,556
She feeds us,
teaches us...

368
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,154
What does she teach you?

369
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,324
Stuff we should
Iearn in school.

370
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,632
And that all the girls
should respect themselves
and each other.

371
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:52,832
This is Samantha Tassler.
Is she one of the girls?

372
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:54,870
No.

373
00:17:56,915 --> 00:18:02,785
The other four girls
are from Denver, Chicago,
Omaha and Detroit.

374
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:04,185
AII high-profile cases

375
00:18:04,255 --> 00:18:07,486
because they all come
from wealthy or upper
middle class families.

376
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,083
How did they react
to being found?

377
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,128
Oh, the same
as Jessica.

378
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:12,390
They all denied
their real names,

379
00:18:12,464 --> 00:18:14,557
they said they'd run
away and that
they weren't kidnapped

380
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:17,624
and they all want
to know when they can go
back to Mrs. Haggerty.

381
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:18,999
Is this
Stockholm Syndrome?

382
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,196
More than that.

383
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,705
These girls haven't
just formed a bond
with this Mrs. Haggerty.

384
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:25,902
Their total devotion
to her feels Iike
they've been brainwashed.

385
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:27,205
So this is some
kind of cult.

386
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:29,838
It explains why
they were all wearing
the infinity symbol.

387
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:32,109
And why they're all
sticking to the same story.

388
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:35,016
Well, unless one of them
starts talking, the best
we can get Haggerty on

389
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:38,078
is custodial interference
for not returning
the kids to their parents.

390
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:40,681
That's just a misdemeanor.
We can't even hold her.
What about Lang?

391
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,225
Right now,
he's untouchable.

392
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,761
If this is a cult, then maybe
Samantha was being punished

393
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:46,763
for misbehaving
or wanting to Ieave.

394
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:50,289
Cults often re-educate
their members by Iocking
them up without food or water.

395
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:51,835
Which is how the M.E.
said that she died.

396
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:53,734
That's depraved
indifference murder.

397
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:56,740
Including Samantha,
we've only found five girls.

398
00:18:56,808 --> 00:18:58,605
Maybe they're holding
more somewhere else.

399
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:01,201
Like at the foundation's
brownstone.

400
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:07,381
What the hell?

401
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:10,552
This place was
completely furnished
when we found the girls.

402
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:12,385
I'II check upstairs.

403
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:19,054
They took every
damn thing.

404
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,190
We need every piece of dirt
off the floor in every room.

405
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:25,259
Any reasonable surface
gets dusted for prints.

406
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:27,895
Second floor is empty.

407
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:29,970
This place has
been sanitized.

408
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,508
Like no one
was ever here.

409
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:40,015
Neighbors say three trucks
pulled up, emptied the place
out in two hours.

410
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:41,517
Somebody had to tip them off.

411
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:43,213
CRAGEN: The call couldn't have
come from any of the girls.

412
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:45,586
We made sure none of them
got near a phone.

413
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:47,318
Well, it had to be
Haggerty or her Iawyer.

414
00:19:47,392 --> 00:19:48,825
That's obstruction
of justice.

415
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:50,258
You think she'd
risk her Iaw Iicense?

416
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,489
We'II ask her as soon
as we're done
processing the girls.

417
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:55,260
AIready done. ACS picked up
the four from out of town,

418
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,460
took them to the shelter
waiting for their parents
to arrive.

419
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:59,230
What about Jessica?

420
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,700
Her folks
just got here.

421
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:04,405
BENSON: She Iooks
real happy to see them.

422
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:06,866
This is a cult
we're dealing with.

423
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:10,073
If we're gonna see Haggerty's
Iawyer, I want Huang along
for the ride.

424
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,418
You can't come barging in.
I'm with clients.

425
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:19,012
I'II handle this,
Joan.

426
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,718
Detectives Benson
and Stabler. And you are?

427
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:23,761
FBI. George Huang.

428
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:24,920
LANG: Can we help you?

429
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:27,123
Who cleaned out your
foundation's brownstone?

430
00:20:27,198 --> 00:20:28,392
How would we know?

431
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:29,831
Oh, come on.
Somebody gave the order.

432
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,766
Now, it was either
you or your attorney.

433
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:33,497
Are you accusing me
of a crime?

434
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:38,599
Well, I'd Iike you to explain
why Dr. Lang and Mrs. Haggerty
both have the same Iawyer.

435
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:41,076
I had called Miss Quentin
after you arrested Paula.

436
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,772
You've made
a terrible mistake.

437
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,008
Do you know how much
she's helped runaways?

438
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,573
You mean after
she kidnaps them?

439
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:48,084
You're wrong, Detective.

440
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:51,315
And what about
Samantha Tassler undergoing
in vitro fertilization,

441
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:53,653
which you happen to perform?
Are we wrong about that, too?

442
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:56,990
Any OB/GYN who's
a fertility specialist
could have done that.

443
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:58,756
Yeah, but she and the other
girls weren't wearing

444
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,027
any other fertility
specialist's infinity
necklace.

445
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,194
And you've got Miss Haggerty
here who's got that symbol
tattooed on her wrist.

446
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,262
Any questions from the FBI,
Agent Huang?

447
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:11,368
You enjoy this,
don't you, Dr. Lang?

448
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:15,708
I enjoy helping those girls
thrive and realize their
full potential.

449
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,546
Because of you people,
we may have to close down
the foundation. Joan?

450
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:23,212
Unless you're going
to arrest me or either
of my clients, we're through.

451
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:26,655
Or my next call is to
the Internal Affairs
Bureau for harassment.

452
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:31,423
He's a narcissistic bastard
and he's calling all
the shots.

453
00:21:31,496 --> 00:21:33,191
You saw the way his
Iawyer deferred to him.

454
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:36,097
I can understand a 14-year-old
being taken in by Lang,

455
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,761
but not a smart,
educated woman
Iike Quentin.

456
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:41,964
Jim Jones got hundreds of
his disciples to drink
poisoned Kool-Aid

457
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,406
because he had
a charismatic
personality.

458
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:47,740
Lang uses his to get people
Iike Quentin and Haggerty
to Iove and obey him.

459
00:21:47,812 --> 00:21:50,212
Those teenage girls
couldn't be more
vulnerable.

460
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:51,373
They're not
that attractive.

461
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:54,384
Probably got bad
grades in school.
They're just social outcasts.

462
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:56,283
So this cult is
a place for them
to fit in.

463
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:59,846
And inundate them with
approval and affection.
It's called Iove bombing.

464
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:01,118
"You're perfect
the way you are."

465
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:03,660
Right, which is what
every teenage girl
wants to hear.

466
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:06,856
And Haggerty as a substitute
mother is a perfect person
to tell them that.

467
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:08,421
There's no way
these girls got to her
by accident.

468
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:11,866
No. They were targeted.
We've got to find out how.

469
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:15,870
MR. TASSLER: First you said
Samantha was homeless and now
you think she was murdered?

470
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,771
BENSON: We're not sure
exactly, Mr. Tassler.

471
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:19,400
That's what we're
investigating.

472
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:23,379
It's possible that Samantha
was starved to death
and Ieft in the alley.

473
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:24,938
Oh, my God.

474
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:29,045
We can still take her home
for the funeral, can't we?

475
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,587
Yes, you can.

476
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:34,656
But we need to know,
at the time of
Samantha's disappearance,

477
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:37,889
were there any changes
in her routine,

478
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:41,329
different people she was
hanging out with, friends?

479
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,300
She only had a few friends,
two or three girls.

480
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:46,635
They were a bad influence.

481
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:47,966
How so?

482
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,372
They drank and smoked
and got Samantha to
do it, too.

483
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:52,739
(SIGHS)

484
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,268
Her grades started to drop
but we couldn't get her
to care.

485
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:59,441
We even enrolled her
in one of those
remedial tutoring centers.

486
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:01,849
You know, the kind
with private instruction.

487
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:06,350
Help kids realize
their full potential.

488
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:09,082
What did you just say?

489
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:12,128
Help kids realize
their full potential.

490
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:14,096
It was in the brochure.

491
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:15,632
What's the name
of that center?

492
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,537
STABLER: You know this girl?

493
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:25,540
No. Never saw her before.
Now why are you here?

494
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,306
She attended this center
right before she
disappeared Iast year.

495
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:31,746
Just Iike this girl
who vanished right
outside of Philly.

496
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,579
I don't Iike your
insinuation, Detective.

497
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:35,619
I don't Iike Iiars,
Miss Kinderski.

498
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:39,087
Well, now,
if you're going to be rude,
this conversation is ended.

499
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:41,091
What are you doing?

500
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,524
Nice tattoo.
An infinity symbol.

501
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:43,617
Yes.

502
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:47,289
We believe in
the infinite potential
of our students to succeed.

503
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:48,525
Is that a crime?

504
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,430
It is if Garret Lang
paid for it.

505
00:23:51,469 --> 00:23:52,561
Garret Lang?

506
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:56,004
Yeah. I bet if we pull your
certificate of incorporation,
his name's on it.

507
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,906
Doctor Lang is a
forward-thinking,
generous man

508
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:02,468
who wants to help
young people further
their knowledge.

509
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:03,844
He's just an investor.

510
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:05,749
Sure, he is.

511
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:07,614
And you're just a teacher,
right?

512
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,281
Kinderski Iawyered up.
Quentin's not
Ietting her talk.

513
00:24:11,355 --> 00:24:12,686
Yeah, but we found
the connection.

514
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:15,487
AII six girls, Samantha
and Jessica included,

515
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,721
attended a Knowledge Builders
Center in their city.

516
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:19,956
Lang's at the top
of the pyramid.

517
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,464
Quentin keeps him
out of trouble,

518
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:22,829
Haggerty keeps
the girls in Iine

519
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,959
and Kinderski recruits them
from the Iearning centers.

520
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:28,563
I wouldn't be surprised
if the initial test they give
includes personality questions

521
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:31,073
to identify the most
susceptible girls.

522
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:33,542
We checked Kinderski's
credit card statements.

523
00:24:33,611 --> 00:24:37,445
She was in Philadelphia,
Detroit, Omaha, Chicago
and Denver

524
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:39,449
three days before each
of the girls disappeared.

525
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:42,486
Which Ieaves us with
another coincidence
but no smoking gun.

526
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:44,453
Well, the other girls
have all gone home.

527
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:46,649
Means we're gonna
have to get Jessica to talk.

528
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:52,486
Pretty tough coming home,
isn't it?

529
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:54,590
I guess.

530
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:58,900
Mrs. Haggerty,

531
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,566
she was good to you,
wasn't she,
at the foundation?

532
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,939
Yeah. I really miss her.

533
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,477
I bet you do.

534
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,480
You want to
talk about it?

535
00:25:13,184 --> 00:25:15,414
You think she
did something bad.

536
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,279
Hey, maybe I'm wrong.

537
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:21,086
If that's the case,
I'd Iike to know about it.

538
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:25,857
Mrs. Haggerty is the most
wonderful person I ever met.

539
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,094
She and the other girls
accepted me for who I am,

540
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:32,226
and not who they
thought I should be.

541
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,736
That's nice.

542
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:37,031
And how about Dr. Lang?
Am I wrong about him?

543
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:38,632
He is a great man.

544
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:41,334
He's going to
save the world.

545
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:44,742
Yeah? How's he
gonna do that?

546
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:47,716
Well, the ozone Iayer
is disappearing.
Yeah.

547
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:51,152
And the ultraviolet rays
will make everybody sterile.

548
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:55,660
So the only way our
species will survive
is by cloning Iiving cells.

549
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,922
Jessica,
are you pregnant?

550
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,326
Yes.

551
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:06,999
He chose me to be
one of the mothers
of the future.

552
00:26:07,806 --> 00:26:11,833
So he told you
that you were
carrying a cloned baby?

553
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:15,679
To help a couple
whose baby died.

554
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:19,345
I'm going to bring
their child back to Iife.

555
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:23,013
Did Dr. Lang have
sex with you?

556
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:26,717
No. He'd never do
such a horrible thing.

557
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:31,059
He took the baby's cells
and put them in my eggs

558
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:33,563
and then put the eggs
back in me.

559
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:37,630
Where'd he do this?

560
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:42,835
BENSON: This is Lang's
Iittle shop of horrors.

561
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:45,399
I'm no expert,
but this equipment
Iooks Iike it cost millions.

562
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:47,035
FIN: Check this out.

563
00:26:47,112 --> 00:26:49,273
Dr. Frankenstein's
doing his experiments.

564
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:51,145
Let's get a bus.
EIIiot, put this on.

565
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:55,877
If my patient
gets an infection

566
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:58,946
because you've contaminated
my sterile field,
she could die.

567
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:00,184
Okay. Is she cut open?

568
00:27:00,258 --> 00:27:01,384
No. Of course not.

569
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,655
Then wake her up,
safely.

570
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:05,390
You don't understand,
do you?

571
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:07,056
I'm going to make
medical history here.

572
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:10,465
Not by using teenage
girls as guinea pigs,
you're not. Wake her up.

573
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:12,503
You're under arrest.

574
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:20,575
So how many more girls
do you have stashed away?

575
00:27:20,646 --> 00:27:22,045
Dr. Lang has assured me...

576
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:23,638
Look, there are
no more.

577
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:26,740
You endangered my patient's
Iife when you entered my
operating room.

578
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:28,649
We stopped you from
experimenting on her.

579
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,813
AII of those
girls consented.

580
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:33,016
You have no idea
how you've harmed
our cause.

581
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:35,252
Oh, we've been through
your records, Doctor.

582
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,488
Your "cause" is preying
on the grief of parents

583
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:39,723
who have Iost a child
by promising them

584
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,925
a cloned baby in
return for a donation.

585
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,959
We've got one here for
half a million dollars.
Now I call that fraud.

586
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:47,130
I call it hope.

587
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:50,231
You can't prove Dr. Lang
intended to defraud anyone.

588
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:53,004
I believe that it is possible
to clone a human being.

589
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:54,636
Well, that's now
illegal in this country.

590
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:57,341
Well, it won't be
once we start dying off.

591
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:00,010
So, we as a species
are on our way out

592
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:02,610
and cloning is our only
chance at survival.
Is that it?

593
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,918
Not just survival,
Detective.

594
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,151
I'm talking about
immortality.

595
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,256
And you use this
idiotic crap to coerce girls
into being human incubators.

596
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:15,492
Stabler, that's
Irish Catholic, right?

597
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,091
Hey, pal, this ain't
about me, it's about you.

598
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:19,000
You believe
a virgin gave birth.

599
00:28:19,071 --> 00:28:21,096
You think that was
a very popular theory
in Jesus' time?

600
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:23,573
What I believe has
got nothing to do
with your case.

601
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:27,237
Doesn't it? Heretics were
burned at the stake for saying
that the world is round.

602
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:32,443
Darwin was vilified for even
suggesting that humans evolved
from the primordial ooze.

603
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:34,985
Yet science and reason
proved him right.

604
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:37,681
So you're saying
that you're the new Darwin?

605
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:39,815
Or maybe even the Messiah?

606
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:41,051
I wouldn't
take it that far.

607
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:43,651
What exactly is my
client charged with?

608
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:46,220
Fraud and aggravated
sexual abuse.

609
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:50,056
You don't really think that
either of those will stand up
in court, do you?

610
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:55,003
He's right.
We can't charge him.

611
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:59,407
AIex, he deceived those
desperate parents and
inseminated minors.

612
00:28:59,478 --> 00:29:01,412
It's not fraud because
there's no intent.

613
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,311
It's not rape because
there's no penetration.

614
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:05,349
And if we arrest him
for aggravated sex abuse,

615
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,817
he'II argue that
the contact was for
a valid medical reason.

616
00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:08,978
My ass.

617
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:10,646
What Lang is doing
in the name of science

618
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:13,156
is no different from what
Mengele did for the Nazis.

619
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:15,420
Except these girls consented
to the procedures.

620
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:16,984
They're not old
enough to consent.

621
00:29:17,062 --> 00:29:19,087
They are when it comes
to reproductive rights.

622
00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:21,928
They don't need
permission to get pregnant,
no matter how they do it.

623
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,400
So that's it?
We can't touch him?

624
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:29,038
Not unless we can prove
he is in some way connected
to Samantha Tassler's death.

625
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:34,809
I'm ruling this a homicide.
The DNA results are back.

626
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,043
The saliva on Samantha's cheek
belongs to Paula Haggerty.

627
00:29:38,116 --> 00:29:41,882
Saliva and facial tissue.
It's Iike a mother
wiping her child's face,

628
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:44,080
the brushing of the hair,
the wrapping in the blanket...

629
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:45,521
Now what about
Samantha's fetus?

630
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,649
I mean, you're not
going to tell us that
that's the clone

631
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:49,819
of some family's
dead child, are you?

632
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:52,864
Until someone
proves otherwise,
that's science fiction.

633
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:55,491
The cloned fetus would
only have DNA from that child.

634
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:58,434
Samantha's had DNA
from herself and a father.

635
00:29:58,503 --> 00:30:00,494
So this whole
cloning thing
is a scam.

636
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:03,063
Samantha's eggs
were fertilized
by someone's sperm.

637
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:04,802
And I wonder who's
that could be?

638
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,003
We'II need DNA from Lang
to prove it's his child.

639
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:09,069
Well, Cabot got us
a blood order for Haggerty.

640
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:10,671
It shouldn't be a problem
getting one for Lang.

641
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:13,616
So, if Samantha's
baby was Lang's,
and she found out,

642
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:15,243
that sure would give Lang
a motive to kill her.

643
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,050
And if Lang fathered
Samantha's baby,

644
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:19,681
who do you think
fathered Jessica's?

645
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:24,526
My parents want me
to give the baby
up for adoption.

646
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:29,292
They took you
to test your baby's DNA.
Do you know why?

647
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:32,029
To make sure
that it's okay.

648
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:33,127
Mmm-hmm.

649
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:36,337
And to find out
who the father is.

650
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:41,075
Dr. Lang says my baby
doesn't have a father.

651
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:44,776
Has he ever
Iied to you?

652
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:46,372
No.

653
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:49,378
Why are you
asking me this?

654
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:57,120
Because the DNA
from your baby tells us
that it does have a father.

655
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,761
That's impossible.

656
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:05,002
Dr. Lang told me that
it was a cloned child.

657
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,937
We tested Dr. Lang.

658
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:10,200
He's the father
of your baby.

659
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:12,839
No!
Yeah.

660
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,010
That's the truth
and I'm sorry about it.

661
00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:23,715
No, I believe in him.
I Iove him.

662
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,985
He fertilized your
egg with his own sperm.

663
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,754
He did the same
thing to Samantha.

664
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:31,787
I... I was helping
a couple whose baby died.

665
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:33,230
He Iied to them, too.

666
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,699
Jessica, they gave
him a Iot of money...

667
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,894
No, please don't!

668
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:37,129
He betrayed them.

669
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:41,004
He betrayed you,
he betrayed Samantha,
and then he killed her.

670
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:44,974
No.

671
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:50,042
It's my fault
she's dead.

672
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,676
What do you mean
it's your fault?

673
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:56,314
Samantha said that
Dr. Lang was a fake,

674
00:31:57,257 --> 00:31:59,748
and that she was going
to report him to the police.

675
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:04,523
And I told
Mrs. Haggerty.

676
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,732
What did Mrs. Haggerty
say to you when you
told her that?

677
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,068
That Samantha had
to be reasoned with.

678
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:20,435
And then one day,
right in front of all of us,

679
00:32:20,514 --> 00:32:22,573
she took Samantha away.

680
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,320
CABOT: Jessica, could you
please describe the room

681
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,988
where Mrs. Haggerty
took Samantha Tassler?

682
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:39,663
It was empty.

683
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:44,762
No chair, no bed, no toilet.

684
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,797
Just four walls,
a floor and a bucket.

685
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:52,104
When was the next time
you saw Samantha?

686
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,339
Never.

687
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:59,580
I didn't even know she was
dead until a week ago when
the police took us away.

688
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,781
Thank you, Jessica.
Nothing further.

689
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:07,620
Was there a Iock on
the door to the room?

690
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:10,554
I don't know.

691
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,622
JOAN: So for all we know,
Samantha could have been
free to Ieave at any time.

692
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,691
Objection.
Sustained.

693
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:18,932
Did you believe that
Dr. Lang could clone a baby?

694
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,063
Yes.

695
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:26,602
Did you believe that the human
race would become extinct
unless he cloned children?

696
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:29,745
Yes.

697
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:32,785
And you believed that
Samantha should be punished,
didn't you?

698
00:33:32,853 --> 00:33:35,048
Yes, but not Iike that.

699
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:37,613
So you're just as responsible
for her death as anyone.

700
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:39,386
Objection.
Withdrawn.

701
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:42,962
Jessica, did you ever,
at any time,

702
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,591
see Dr. Lang around Samantha
or at the foundation home?

703
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,657
No. We always went
to see him alone.

704
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:52,364
Did Dr. Lang ever ask you
to do anything that
you didn't want to do?

705
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,463
No, but...

706
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,134
You Ioved him very much,
didn't you, Jessica?

707
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,873
Yes.

708
00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:03,109
Nothing further.

709
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:10,013
I was on one of the first
teams to successfully
clone a cat.

710
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:13,519
I'm close to
cloning a human being.

711
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,118
Dolly the sheep
only Iived for six years.

712
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:20,155
And experts say that
cloned human babies
could be sick or deformed.

713
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:23,225
So, isn't it irresponsible
to even try?

714
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:26,932
Medical visionaries
throughout history
have been ridiculed.

715
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:30,272
Not only do you not know
how this is going to turn out,

716
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:32,038
you don't even know
how to do it, do you?

717
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,544
So why did you promise cloned
babies to parents who had Iost
their children?

718
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:40,412
Oh, I have every intention
of delivering on that promise.

719
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:42,455
But you testified on
direct examination

720
00:34:42,522 --> 00:34:45,320
that you used your sperm
to fertilize the eggs

721
00:34:45,392 --> 00:34:48,259
you had taken from
Samantha Tassler
and the other girls.

722
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:51,354
So you were going
to give your children
to those parents?

723
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:53,729
Until I'm able to clone
their babies, yes.

724
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,030
But you were
going to continue
taking their money.

725
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:58,162
The money was crucial
for me to continue.

726
00:34:58,238 --> 00:34:59,899
I have no other way
to fund my research.

727
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,134
Research that is
now against the Iaw.

728
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,440
What were you going to tell
those mothers
and those fathers?

729
00:35:05,512 --> 00:35:08,003
I would have told
those parents to be patient.

730
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:09,571
And they would have
had other children to Iove.

731
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,743
Children who belonged to girls
Iike Samantha whose eggs
you took.

732
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,949
Those girls,
Samantha included,
consented to the procedures.

733
00:35:17,023 --> 00:35:21,483
Really? Did Samantha also
consent to being Iocked in
a room without food or water?

734
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,461
Objection.
Withdrawn.

735
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:27,064
Dr. Lang, isn't it true
you were afraid the money
would dry up

736
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:30,695
when the parents who paid you
to clone their children found
out that you had Iied to them?

737
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,036
You're treating me Iike
a criminal, when I'm trying
to give Iife, not destroy it.

738
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:37,440
You destroyed
Samantha Tassler's.

739
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,411
You knew if she exposed
what you were really doing,

740
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,810
your research would be
all washed up.

741
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:42,644
Objection.
Withdrawn.

742
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:45,614
No further questions.

743
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,422
Re-direct, Your Honor.

744
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:53,084
Dr. Lang, did you ever set
foot in the Foundation for
Knowledge Expansion?

745
00:35:53,162 --> 00:35:54,993
Only in the beginning,
when we were setting it up

746
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:57,224
and never when
the girls were there.

747
00:35:57,299 --> 00:35:58,732
Who took care of the girls?

748
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,199
Paula Haggerty.

749
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:02,430
Did you ever tell
Mrs. Haggerty
how to handle the girls?

750
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:05,735
No. She was more than
qualified to take care
of them on her own.

751
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:08,708
When did you Iast
see Samantha Tassler?

752
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:13,111
When I confirmed her
pregnancy a week before
she died.

753
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:18,916
So Mrs. Haggerty is the only
one who could have known
what happened to her?

754
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:23,124
LANG: Mrs. Haggerty sets
her own rules at
the foundation house.

755
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:25,660
I can't speak to
what took place there.

756
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:30,323
Thank you, Doctor.
No further questions.
The defense rests, Your Honor.

757
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,996
I don't need
another Iawyer.

758
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,630
Miss Quentin
is on her way.

759
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:42,768
I have asked Mr. Langan
to represent you
until she gets here.

760
00:36:42,844 --> 00:36:43,868
I'd rather wait.

761
00:36:43,946 --> 00:36:45,208
Why?

762
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,113
So your attorney can tell you
to keep your mouth shut?

763
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:50,549
Don't you understand?
They are sacrificing you.

764
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:53,214
I don't have to
answer that, do I?

765
00:36:54,156 --> 00:36:56,818
No, but I'd advise you
to consider what
Ms. Cabot is saying.

766
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:57,914
(SCOFFS)

767
00:36:57,993 --> 00:37:00,723
What's the difference?
I'm guilty.

768
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,355
You'd spend the rest
of your Iife in prison

769
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,730
so Garret Lang is free
to continue his work?

770
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,762
Yes, if that's
what it takes.

771
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:09,997
Why would you martyr
yourself for him?

772
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:12,939
He gave me back
something I had Iost.

773
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:17,644
You mean your daughter?

774
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:21,239
Who told you
about Carrie?

775
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:24,217
We found the missing persons
report from 1975.

776
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:26,918
When she ran away.

777
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,787
You never saw
her again, did you?

778
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:31,854
No.

779
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:36,986
That's why I wanted to work
with teenage girls.

780
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:41,599
I wanted to help them find
a place that they could
always call home.

781
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,399
And Dr. Lang
gave that to you?

782
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:44,803
Yes.

783
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:48,070
He told me that I could Iove
and help teenage girls

784
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:51,670
and that they would
bring back to Iife

785
00:37:52,848 --> 00:37:56,306
these dead children
of these poor parents.

786
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:58,444
But those girls
have parents, too.

787
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,683
Those parents should
have treated them better!

788
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:05,125
Better than you treated
your own daughter?

789
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:10,861
Carrie was very Iittle
when my husband Ieft us.

790
00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:15,096
And I didn't handle it well.

791
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:22,474
We fought constantly
and then one day I woke up
and she was gone.

792
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:29,245
In her note she said that
she had to Ieave me because
she had...

793
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,511
She had to find a mother.

794
00:38:35,957 --> 00:38:37,788
Paula?

795
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,124
We brought you a visitor.
It's Jessica.

796
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:49,798
You're not mad at me?

797
00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:51,969
No.

798
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,203
They told me all
about your Iittle girl.

799
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:59,338
I Iove my parents,
but I still Iove you, too.

800
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:08,122
AII Lang has done is
manipulated your pain.

801
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:13,226
He's used you to help him
experiment on
girls who Iove you.

802
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:14,819
They trust you.

803
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,326
You're the only one
who can stop him.

804
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:31,643
HAGGERTY: Marcie Kinderski
at Knowledge Builders

805
00:39:31,713 --> 00:39:35,479
identified each girl
at her individual
Iearning center.

806
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,713
That's where
the indoctrination began.

807
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,723
Who brought
the girls to you?

808
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,920
They were told to Ieave
and come to New York
on their own.

809
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:49,452
Dr. Lang said it was
to avoid kidnapping charges.

810
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:56,300
But Marcie gave them money
for the trip and false IDs
if they were coming by plane.

811
00:39:56,371 --> 00:39:59,431
And once the girls arrived,
what was your role?

812
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:01,937
I was...

813
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:04,874
I was their mother

814
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:08,644
and teacher

815
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:11,116
and nurse.

816
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,148
I gave them
hormone injections

817
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:18,385
to prepare them
for the procedures.

818
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:22,619
When Samantha Tassler
wanted to Ieave,
what did you do?

819
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,892
Reasoned with her.

820
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,737
I put her in a room
in the basement,
as is the doctrine.

821
00:40:31,773 --> 00:40:33,331
Did you give her
any food or water?

822
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:35,569
No. I was ordered
not to.

823
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:36,872
By whom?

824
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:40,813
By Dr. Lang.
He said she had
to be re-programmed.

825
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:42,509
Who did
the re-programming?

826
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:43,812
He did.

827
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:47,946
He came over at night
after they had gone to sleep.

828
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:54,219
What happened on
the sixth night
of Samantha's re-programming?

829
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:56,924
I went to check on her.
She... She...

830
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,489
(STAMMERING)

831
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:02,734
She could barely move.

832
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:07,040
And just as I was about
to give her some water,

833
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,800
Dr. Lang

834
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,475
walked in

835
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:16,574
and took it
away from me.

836
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:18,380
(GASPS)

837
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:21,012
Samantha died
in my arms.

838
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,448
What happened next?

839
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,015
She was so dirty.

840
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:29,262
I tried to wipe
her face with tissue,

841
00:41:29,331 --> 00:41:33,131
I fixed her hair
and I put a blanket
around her.

842
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:38,763
And then we carried
her out to my car.

843
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:43,041
Dr. Lang said that
I should Ieave her.

844
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,578
As if...
As if she were homeless.

845
00:41:50,352 --> 00:41:51,614
(SOBBING)

846
00:41:51,686 --> 00:41:55,645
But I tried to make her
as comfortable as possible.

847
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,783
Paula, why are you
doing this?

848
00:41:57,859 --> 00:41:59,850
Why would you
betray me Iike this?

849
00:41:59,928 --> 00:42:02,226
Dr. Lang, you are
out of order!

850
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:04,822
This entire trial
is out of order.

851
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,494
Don't you understand?
I'm trying to save you.

852
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,332
I'm trying to save
the human race.

853
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:12,202
Sit down, Dr. Lang,
or I will have you removed!

854
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:13,764
The cat's out of the bag,
folks!

855
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:15,332
Remove the defendant!

856
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,005
Science and the future
wait for no one.

857
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,208
If not for me,
someone will clone
a human being.

858
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:25,012
You wait and see!
