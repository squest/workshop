1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:00,164
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:04,933
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:06,065
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:09,076
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:12,671
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:14,739
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,951
She's the COO now.
You need to
watch your ass.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,386
If Amanda wants to fire me,
not much I can do about it.

9
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:21,547
Fight back, Mark.

10
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:23,090
She humiliates you
in front of everybody,

11
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:25,058
treats you Iike her
personal assistant.

12
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:26,424
File a complaint
with Human Resources.

13
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:28,429
And I'II still be
out of a job.

14
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,528
I'm serious.

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,561
Hey, what the hell
happened here?

16
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,698
You smell that?

17
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,470
Yeah.
It's Iike a urinal.

18
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,670
Is that
what I think it is?

19
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,880
(MOANING)

20
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:52,283
Oh, my God! It's Amanda.

21
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,588
Who did this to you?

22
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:04,897
Perineal bruising
and tearing

23
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:06,160
from rape and sodomy.

24
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,862
Friction burns
around the neck,
wrist and ankles,

25
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:11,997
and a scalp Iaceration
from being struck
with a sharp object.

26
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:13,666
The wound's deep
but not serious.

27
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:14,766
Any fluids present?

28
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:16,777
No, he wore condoms.

29
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:18,608
Your Iab should find
Iubricant in the specimen.

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,704
She say anything?

31
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,271
Not to me.

32
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,647
But maybe the other officers
will have her statement now.

33
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:25,276
It's Exam Room 3.

34
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,843
WOMAN: You have
the right to an attorney.

35
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,219
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,190
Detective Stabler, SVU.
What's going on?

37
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,282
FBI.

38
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,224
This is a rape victim
in our jurisdiction.

39
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:35,422
Not our concern.
At the moment,
she's under arrest.

40
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:36,589
Ms. Curry,
do you understand
your rights

41
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:37,689
as I've read them
to you?

42
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:38,994
Why are you guys
doing this to me?

43
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,466
I was attacked
and raped.

44
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,435
Do you understand
your rights?

45
00:01:42,504 --> 00:01:43,528
Yes.

46
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,232
Look, we have to get
Ms. Curry's statement.

47
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:47,605
There's a rapist out there.
We'd Iike to get
a description.

48
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:48,802
You can do that
in federal Iockup,

49
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,208
but it's gonna take
a while to process her.

50
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,540
What are the charges?

51
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:52,637
Securities fraud,

52
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:55,114
violating interstate
and international
banking Iaws,

53
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,515
money Iaundering
for a criminal enterprise

54
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:58,917
and tax evasion.

55
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:51,367
Where the hell's our witness?

56
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,464
You know how
the Feds are.

57
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,635
They just Iove to flex
their muscles.

58
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,268
They usually work with us,
so why the stall?

59
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,176
CLAUDIA: Where are they?
MAN: Lockup Two.

60
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:01,272
I think we're about
to find out.

61
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,442
Assistant US Attorney
CIaudia Williams.

62
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:04,985
My apologies for the delay.

63
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:06,042
Where's Ms. Curry?

64
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:07,247
Outside.

65
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:08,949
I wanted to
talk to you first.

66
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,049
You cannot interrogate
the prisoner

67
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,286
about the federal case
against her

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,554
or anything
relating to it.

69
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,323
Well, what if her
criminal affiliations

70
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:16,921
directly relate
to the attack?

71
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:19,364
Well, if Ms. Curry's
business associates
were involved,

72
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,526
she'd be in the morgue.

73
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:21,933
Money Iaundering's
a RICO charge.

74
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:23,334
So she's in bed
with organized crime.

75
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,566
We talking LCN
or the Russians?

76
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,198
Stop fishing,
Detective Stabler.

77
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:30,369
Well, if you'd just
share a Iittle bit,
I wouldn't have to.

78
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:31,639
There's too much at stake.

79
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,045
We're not interested
in your case.

80
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,309
We're trying to find
a rapist,

81
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,578
but we can't do that
if you obstruct justice.

82
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:41,452
Well, until you file a 61,
I'm not obstructing anything.

83
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:45,254
And unless I allow you access,
you won't be able to do that.

84
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:47,252
So, what's it gonna be?

85
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,889
Oh, I guess
we'II just bend over.

86
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,890
I'II be right outside.

87
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,231
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

88
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,897
Thanks a Iot. Ms. Curry,
have a seat please.

89
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,344
Where should I start?

90
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,437
BENSON:
Well, why don't you start

91
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,982
by taking us
through your day?

92
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,486
Gym, work, Iunch,
work, meeting, work.

93
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:13,748
Where do you
work out?

94
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:15,687
It's called Workout Studio.

95
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,349
Couple of blocks
from the office.

96
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,915
Did you go out
for Iunch?

97
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:20,518
No, I ate at my desk.

98
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:21,584
Delivered?

99
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:23,255
My assistant
went out and got it.

100
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,094
When were you attacked?

101
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,861
Around 11:00.

102
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:29,335
I was in my office
crunching the next
quarter projections

103
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:30,496
for an emergency meeting.

104
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:32,472
Anybody else around?

105
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,973
Everyone Ieft
hours before.

106
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:38,508
That's why when I
heard the noise,
I went Iooking.

107
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,707
But as soon as I
opened up my door,

108
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:43,979
this man rushed me,
and after that,
it was Iights out.

109
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:45,542
Can you describe him?

110
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,454
Not really.
I just got a glimpse.

111
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:52,322
White, average height.

112
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:55,761
Any distinguishing marks?
Anything you can remember?

113
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,854
No.

114
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,060
Did he say anything?
Yeah.

115
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:05,339
That it was payback.

116
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,432
I thought he was
going to kill me.

117
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,670
Okay, is it possible that

118
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,606
the people you're accused
of working for

119
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,241
might have been trying
to send you a message?

120
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:17,148
Could be.

121
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,812
They're brutal, vicious men.

122
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:22,413
But they don't make a move
without Sergei's say so.

123
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,479
He would've cut my throat...

124
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:26,186
That's enough.
Get her out of there.

125
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:38,499
Good news is
we got enough urine
to test.

126
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,302
If we're Iucky,
there'II be some
DNA in it.

127
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,070
Perp gave her
a golden shower?

128
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,542
Rape took place on the table.

129
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,135
Found footprints
where he stood
over her.

130
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:47,272
Making the
humiliation complete.
Yeah.

131
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:49,715
The bad news is
there's too many prints
and fibers.

132
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:50,910
This kind
of building security,

133
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,179
maybe our perp
actually works here.

134
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,311
Or pretended to.

135
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:54,582
We found a
cleaning crew jumpsuit

136
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:55,987
stuffed under
the reception desk.

137
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,457
What company?
Atlas.

138
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:04,160
The great thing about
criminals, no matter how
smart they think they are,

139
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,665
they're not
smarter than me.

140
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:08,100
You found traces
of seminal fluid.
Not a drop.

141
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:09,693
But we did find
a few short and curlies

142
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:10,829
that didn't belong
to the victim.

143
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,395
Okay, so we got DNA.

144
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:14,305
Matching two
other rape cases,

145
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:15,604
both in Brooklyn.

146
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,872
AIso, your perp suffers
from diabetes.

147
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,038
How do you know that?

148
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:21,708
We found glucose
but no ketones in the urine.

149
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:24,411
I'd say he's
a middle-aged onset diabetic

150
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:25,748
who's not taking his meds

151
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,980
or doesn't know
that he's sick.

152
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:28,181
Based on what?

153
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:29,814
The Ievel of sugar's
pretty high,

154
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,620
and juvenile diabetics
Iearn early on

155
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:33,320
that if they forget
an insulin injection,

156
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,158
it can prove fatal.

157
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,755
Our serial rapist
started with two
Brooklyn targets.

158
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,130
The first victim,
Petra Ivankov,

159
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,998
was raped six months ago.

160
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,970
Worked as a stripper
at the Volga CIub,

161
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,029
a known front
for the Russian mob.

162
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,337
Mob boss
Sergei Perlman's girlfriend.

163
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,106
She got smoked
after talking to Brooklyn SVU
about her rape.

164
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:53,613
They were probably
scared she was gonna
slip pillow talk.

165
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,117
Number two is Perlman's
baby sister, Tatiana.

166
00:06:57,185 --> 00:06:59,676
She died of uterine cancer
three months ago.

167
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,517
BIitz attacked
after a chemo treatment.

168
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,613
Took a pretty bad beating.

169
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,057
Our guy is definitely
Iosing control
and escalating.

170
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:08,687
Our victim, Amanda Curry,
raped, beaten and sodomized.

171
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,060
What did Brooklyn say

172
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,395
about the Russian connection
between their two victims?

173
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,230
I mean,
why choose these women

174
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:15,860
if not trying to get
at Perlman somehow?

175
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:16,926
Did they even
talk to this guy?

176
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,666
Organized Crime Bureau
shut them down.

177
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,729
Wouldn't Iet them near him.

178
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:21,400
Completely stalled
their investigation.

179
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,808
Sergei's a major player.
If we're Iooking
for someone with a grudge,

180
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:24,936
it's gonna be a Iong Iist.

181
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:27,038
What about physical evidence
other than the DNA?

182
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:28,946
The Iab's still working
on print elimination.

183
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,814
But they found a discarded
cleaning crew jumpsuit

184
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,352
from Atlas Janitorial.

185
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,888
The supervisor mentioned
a car blocking
the service entrance,

186
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,981
so we checked
the outside cameras.

187
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,923
The way
they were positioned,
you can't see much.

188
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,393
AII we saw was
a Iate model Ford Focus,
Jersey tags.

189
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:43,192
We can only make out "JLQ."

190
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:44,561
What about
cameras inside?

191
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,259
Well, they're in
the stairwells
and they're outside,

192
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,700
so female employees
feel safe working Iate.

193
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,431
I say we check out
the Russian angle.

194
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:51,972
Knock on a few doors
in Brighton Beach,

195
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,132
see what shakes Ioose.

196
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,334
Well, the Feds
will be all over us

197
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:55,706
before we ask
the first question.

198
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:57,210
Well, we do have a job to do.

199
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:00,679
Before we declare war,
there is another connection.

200
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,181
Both our victim
and the stripper

201
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,740
belonged to the same gym.

202
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,786
Workout Studio
was Iisted in her file.

203
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:07,446
What about Perlman's sister?

204
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:08,853
Well, nothing was
in her file.

205
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:09,912
Brooklyn probably
didn't ask

206
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,255
because she
was dying of cancer.

207
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,526
Okay, here it is.

208
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:19,089
AII three women
had recent memberships.

209
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,794
We had sent out
a promotional mailer

210
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:23,497
to businesses
and Iocal residents.

211
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:24,902
What's all this about?

212
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:26,873
An assault.
You're kidding.

213
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,966
When did they start
their memberships?

214
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,873
(SIGHING)

215
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,643
Within the Iast
year-and-a-half.

216
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:35,114
BENSON: They know each other?
They work out together?

217
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,117
I never saw them
with each other.

218
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,652
We're gonna need a Iist
of all your members

219
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,381
and all your male employees.

220
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,047
We have about
500 members

221
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,023
and just 10
on full-time staff.

222
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:47,357
Who owns the club?
My father.

223
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:51,255
You have any employees
40 years or older?

224
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,766
Just my dad.
Everyone else is under 30.

225
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,427
STABLER: What capacity
does he work in?

226
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:56,527
I run the place.

227
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,764
Dad just Iooks
over the books.

228
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,067
Makes sure we have
what we need.

229
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,404
How often does he
come in here?

230
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:03,808
Wait a second.
Dad doesn't interact
with our clients.

231
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,004
He wouldn't even know them.

232
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,071
What kind of car
does he drive?
A Focus.

233
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,317
PIate's a match.

234
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:13,547
Still not enough
for a warrant.

235
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,317
I'm Peter Sipes.
My son called.

236
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:17,824
He tells me
you have questions.

237
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,052
Mr. Sipes, if it's
all right with you,

238
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:20,856
we'd Iike to do this
down at our precinct.

239
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:23,159
Am I under arrest?
Not yet.

240
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,991
I can assure you
I didn't assault anyone.

241
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,729
Then you got
nothing to worry about.

242
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:30,895
(PETER SIGHING)

243
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:32,837
I don't see why you had to
drag me down here for this.

244
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:33,965
I've done nothing wrong.

245
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:38,206
Gregory.
It's Mike from LA.
I thought you were dead.

246
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,871
You're drunk.
I don't know you.

247
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:42,143
I swear, you got
a twin out there,
you know that?

248
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:43,444
Take it easy.

249
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:48,047
Can I get you
something to drink?

250
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:49,680
Soda, if you have it.

251
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,419
I thought you diabetics
had to control
your sugar intake.

252
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:54,654
Maybe you'd Iike some water?

253
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,925
I don't know what
you're talking about.

254
00:09:56,998 --> 00:09:58,989
Where were you
the night before Iast?

255
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,227
At my job.

256
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,666
I'm the shift supervisor
at a packaging plant
in East Orange.

257
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:06,070
So you own a gym
and you work?

258
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,335
Well, it's not a chain
Iike Bally's, Detective.

259
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,400
What shift do you work?

260
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,605
I work from 10:00 p.m.
to 6:00 a.m.

261
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,773
You drive to work?

262
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:16,817
What's this
really about?

263
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,215
Rape, Mr. Sipes.

264
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,518
I did not rape anybody.

265
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,116
Then you'II be willing
to Iet us take a mouth swab.

266
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:27,457
Make this
whole thing go away.

267
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:33,597
You want my DNA,
you're gonna have
to get a warrant.

268
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,728
We don't have
enough for a judge,

269
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,533
but I don't want to cut
this guy Ioose.

270
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:39,664
Let's do a voice Iineup.

271
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:41,572
I'II keep the suspect
on ice until then.

272
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,304
Well, we know how well
those hold up in court.

273
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:44,402
Well, it doesn't matter.

274
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,743
Amanda Curry
picks this guy's voice
out of the six,

275
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:47,940
we got enough for a warrant.

276
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,381
The AUSA
is not gonna Iet us

277
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,577
just take her prisoner
for a ride.

278
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,883
I'II have Cabot
pave the way.

279
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,054
Sorry. Amanda Curry's
not here.

280
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:01,095
She get transferred
to another facility?

281
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,527
Nope.

282
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:04,428
Does it say where she is?

283
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,194
I don't even know
who she is.

284
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:09,199
There is no record
of an Amanda Curry
in the system.

285
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,966
But that's impossible.
We interviewed her
in that cell yesterday.

286
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,031
I don't know who
the hell you talked to,

287
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:17,407
but no one was processed
through here by that name.

288
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,343
She's gone.

289
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:25,909
Metropolitan Correctional
claims they never
even heard of her.

290
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:28,751
I got a call from
the US Attorney's office
with assurances.

291
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:29,915
As soon as we
make an arrest,

292
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:31,583
they will produce
Amanda Curry for trial.

293
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:32,751
How are we supposed to do that

294
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:34,419
without the cooperation
of our complaining witness?

295
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:37,055
We ran the rape suspect's
prints off the coffee mug.

296
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,429
We got zip.
No arrests, no record.

297
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,594
So we checked
the property rolls,
the tax rolls, city permits.

298
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,932
Seems that Peter and his son

299
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:46,303
have consecutive
Social Security numbers.

300
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,171
How's that possible?
A few years back,

301
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,834
a couple got
pinched in Delaware

302
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:51,037
for running a stock scam.

303
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:52,977
The entire family
had consecutive numbers.

304
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,880
They'd been relocated
in the Witness
Protection Program.

305
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,008
It's gotta be WITSEC.

306
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,416
That's run by US Marshals,

307
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:02,047
which would explain
the US Attorney's
interest in this case.

308
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:04,819
There was a drunk
cuffed out in the corridor.

309
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,019
He recognized our suspect.
He called him Gregory.

310
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:09,222
And then he just waves it off
Iike it was an honest mistake.

311
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:11,731
We should talk to him.
Find out who Peter really is.

312
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,064
We do that, we'II blow
a protected witness's cover.

313
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:18,866
AII right, you and Munch
sit this drunk down,

314
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,534
and after that,
put him in our holding pen
for the duration.

315
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:22,701
Who we Iooking for?

316
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,108
I'II go ask
the desk sergeant.

317
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,669
You know, if our rapist
is a protected witness

318
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:28,010
how are we gonna
get around the Feds?

319
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,140
We won't have to.

320
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:31,549
You commit a crime
in the program,
you go to prison.

321
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,019
Sammy the Bull
is serving 15
for dealing drugs.

322
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,385
We'II check Peter's alibi,

323
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,287
see if he
was working his shift,

324
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,689
but he's still testifying,

325
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,058
they're not gonna
hand him over.

326
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:43,797
FIN: Michael Kerring, get up.
You got company.

327
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:46,163
Whatever it is,
I didn't do it.

328
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:47,826
You have an interesting
r�sum�, Michael.

329
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:50,370
Shoplifting,
a few B and E's
and purse snatching.

330
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:51,462
I'm not very good at it

331
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,097
or I wouldn't keep
getting pinched.

332
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:56,075
So I know I can't help you.

333
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,873
What do you guys
do here, anyway?

334
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,743
We catch rapists,
pedophiles
and murderers.

335
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,715
Damn.

336
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:06,083
Well, in that case,
I can honestly say

337
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:08,054
that whatever it is,
I didn't do it.

338
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,282
I am no short eyes.

339
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:11,825
I have never touched a woman
that I didn't have to pay for.

340
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:12,917
SIow your roll, moron.

341
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:15,087
We're just Iooking
for some background.

342
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:16,528
We brought a guy
in on a rape beef,

343
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:18,588
and we're told
you were friends.

344
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,430
Turns out he's got
a couple of aliases
we want to check.

345
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:24,565
I don't know
anybody Iike that.

346
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,802
You saw him right
out there in the hallway.
You called him Gregory.

347
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,001
I was drunk.

348
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,306
It couldn't have been him.
He's been dead for years.

349
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,313
MUNCH: Who's dead?
Gregory.

350
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,348
Rossovitch.

351
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:40,350
He used to run
with some serious hitters,
in way over his head.

352
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,718
Who did he run with?

353
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,916
Russians in West Hollywood.

354
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,459
Pulling gas tax,
Medicaid fraud,

355
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,927
shipping bootleg vodka,
kidnapping, the whole nine.

356
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,021
If he was that big time,
how'd you know him?

357
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,588
I used to be a gas jockey.

358
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,534
They put me in charge
of pumping hijacked diesel.

359
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,070
How'd he die?

360
00:13:58,506 --> 00:13:59,768
Car bomb.

361
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,572
Was that really him?

362
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:07,146
Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

363
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:08,807
FIN: What's the problem?

364
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:14,214
They put a heavy contract
out on Gregory.

365
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,654
You open this up,
you're asking for trouble.

366
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,385
Why'd they want him dead?

367
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,451
I heard
he was spilling his guts
to the Feds.

368
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,258
Bodies were dropping
all over the place.

369
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:25,026
Friends, business associates.

370
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,124
They even killed his parents.

371
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,761
That's when I moved East.

372
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,998
Guess I didn't go far enough.

373
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,035
BENSON: Looks Iike
we're too Iate.

374
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:42,082
Hi. Lynn Moody.
You folks interested
in seeing the house?

375
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,084
Actually we're interested
in the whereabouts
of the owner.

376
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,017
Oh. That I can't tell you.

377
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,783
I only got the Iisting
Iast night.

378
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:49,914
Who hired you?

379
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,253
CIaudia Williams.

380
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,850
When I got here,
there was a moving crew
in overdrive.

381
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,953
CIeaned the entire house out
in under four hours.

382
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,396
I've never seen
anything Iike it.

383
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:05,704
I don't suppose
I can convince you
to Iet me do the talking?

384
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:06,967
What's there
to talk about?

385
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,804
Either the AUSA
hands over our suspect

386
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:10,741
or she goes to jail
for obstruction.

387
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,608
We want her cooperation.

388
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,841
Peter wasn't at work
the night of the rape.

389
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,508
We've got a warrant
for his blood.

390
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,142
What else do we need?

391
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,914
You can go in now.

392
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:25,653
Thank you for taking
the time to see us,
Ms. Williams.

393
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,591
CIaudia. How can I help you?

394
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,095
Tell us the whereabouts
of Peter Sipes,

395
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:31,563
we'II get out of your hair.

396
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,793
No.
What do you mean, no?

397
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:35,460
You're harboring
a rapist, Counselor,

398
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,902
and using federal tax dollars
to do it.

399
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:42,102
Was there a trial
that I don't know about,
Detective Stabler?

400
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,906
We have a warrant
for Peter Sipes' blood,

401
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,140
duly signed by
a superior court judge.

402
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:51,646
I'II have it drawn
and delivered to your Iab.

403
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:52,845
Is that amenable?

404
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,615
The evidentiary chain
has to be followed.

405
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,281
We draw the blood, not you.

406
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:57,847
Now we're splitting hairs.

407
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:00,520
Is Gregory Rossovitch,
aka Peter Sipes, that
important to your case

408
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,961
that you're willing
to Iet him skate
on three class B felonies?

409
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:05,864
CLAUDIA: The DOJ
does not condone
criminal behavior.

410
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,561
Okay. Then why'd you move him?

411
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:10,070
Because he told us
he was recognized

412
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:11,765
by someone in your precinct.

413
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:13,965
Most of what
we now know about the mob

414
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,634
comes from Peter's testimony,

415
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,474
and he is an invaluable asset,

416
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:19,343
and we will protect him
at all costs.

417
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,905
At the expense of three women
who were raped and brutalized

418
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:24,043
by the man
that you are now shielding
from justice.

419
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,711
If he did do that,
he will go to prison,

420
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:28,051
but I think you have
the wrong man.

421
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:29,988
Where's Amanda Curry?

422
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,089
Unavailable to you.

423
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:35,721
How is she connected
to Peter Sipes?

424
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:38,592
AII of the victims
Iead back to the Russian mob.

425
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,067
Do you really think
that's a coincidence?

426
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:45,300
What is Peter's motive?
Why would he rape
these women?

427
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:48,832
You can tell by
the extent of the damage
that he's escalating.

428
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,434
Does somebody have to die
for you to care?

429
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,707
I know what you're up against.

430
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:56,444
But if, for one second,
I thought that my witness
was responsible,

431
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,042
I'd turn him over.

432
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,281
Why are you
protecting this guy?

433
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,218
Two hundred
and fifty-seven murders,

434
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:10,389
all ordered
by Sergei Perlman.

435
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,894
Policemen, businessmen,

436
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:16,028
because they wouldn't
pay extortion.

437
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:17,537
Even children,
butchered for fear

438
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:20,632
they might grow up
and seek revenge.

439
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:21,801
We've solved almost half,

440
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:24,368
and we've connected
California to New York

441
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:25,879
through Peter Sipes.

442
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:29,914
Does that answer
your question?

443
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:36,986
Can she really stop us?

444
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,583
No, but she can slow us down.

445
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,922
Hinder our investigation.

446
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:42,964
You know, I don't care
who that woman works for.
We can't Iet her do that.

447
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:44,931
CIaudia Williams
is doing her job.

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,729
She has an obligation
to protect her witnesses.

449
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:48,565
We have an obligation
to protect innocent women.

450
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:50,434
So whose side of the fence
you gonna sit on?

451
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:53,065
You seem awfully sure
Peter Sipes is guilty.

452
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:54,733
What are we
supposed to think?

453
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,574
It can't be easy
Iosing your identity,
starting over.

454
00:17:57,646 --> 00:17:59,671
These people
cost him his past,

455
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,010
they're threatening
his survival.

456
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,072
I'm just not so sure

457
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,879
he would jeopardize
his Iast Iine of defense

458
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,544
against the very people
who want him dead.

459
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,349
What you're saying is
then that organized crime

460
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:08,946
takes precedence
over rape.

461
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:10,548
Arguments can be made
for both.

462
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,922
AIex, we don't have
that Iuxury.

463
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:13,722
We're working with
a serial rapist here.

464
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:16,992
And the next woman,
I'm telling you,
he's gonna kill her.

465
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,324
I will file a habeas
in the morning.

466
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:22,097
If CIaudia Williams
cannot produce the body,

467
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,968
the judge is going to
find her in contempt.

468
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:30,536
CABOT: The People request
habeas corpus, Your Honor.

469
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,773
A warrant was issued
for a blood sample
for a rape suspect

470
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:34,543
who is a federally
protected witness.

471
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:35,708
He has been made unavailable

472
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:37,445
by the United States
Attorney's office.

473
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,046
I made an offer
to have the blood drawn
by the FBI Iab

474
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:42,590
and delivered to the police.

475
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:43,988
The case isn't federal.

476
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,219
It falls under
the jurisdiction

477
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:47,124
of the city and county
of New York.

478
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:50,028
Special circumstances.
Our witness was recognized.

479
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:51,258
Objection.

480
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,767
Peter Sipes is a suspect
in three brutal rapes.

481
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:54,893
He is not a witness.

482
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,406
Nevertheless, he was spotted
at a Iocal precinct
by a former acquaintance

483
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:00,464
and had to be
moved immediately.

484
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,874
How can we settle
this amicably?

485
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,674
The AUSA is in contempt
of state Iaw, Your Honor.

486
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:06,975
Either she produces
the suspect

487
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,915
or she should sit in a cell
until she does.

488
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:11,953
She's made an excellent point.

489
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,851
Why shouldn't I give her
what she wants, CIaudia?

490
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:17,824
You know what I'm up against.
Perlman has eyes everywhere.

491
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:20,623
I have made every
effort to cooperate.

492
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:23,323
I mean, what difference
does it make
who takes the blood?

493
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:25,992
Chain of evidence.
How can we be sure
it's the suspect's

494
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,500
unless we actually draw it?

495
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,036
Objection.

496
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:30,696
I'm offended
by the implication.

497
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:31,932
Who else
would the blood come from?

498
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:33,634
Mistakes are made
all the time.

499
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,869
If that's true,
then I'm more inclined

500
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:37,809
to trust a federal
Iab facility

501
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,473
with greater resources
than your own.

502
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:48,318
Four vials of O negative
belonging to Peter Sipes,
as promised.

503
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,018
Yeah, and how can we be sure
this isn't your blood?

504
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:53,390
Signed affidavits
by the FBI Iab technicians

505
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:55,554
stating Iocation,
time and subject.

506
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,258
Or will you argue
conspiracy now?

507
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,733
No, I'm hoping
you just bend the Iaw

508
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,269
and don't actually break it.

509
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:02,497
I had the blood tested.

510
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:04,540
I wanted to make sure
that my trust
was not misplaced.

511
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:05,733
And what did you find?

512
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,708
I included the Iab report
with the affidavits.

513
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:09,369
I figured you'd want
to test it yourself.

514
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:11,208
Don't try to tell us
the DNA doesn't match.

515
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,474
Fine, but Peter Sipes
is cleared,

516
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:15,608
and you still have
a rapist out there.

517
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:22,187
Does our Iab report
match the FBI results?

518
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:23,384
Yes, it does.

519
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,120
Peter Sipes is innocent.

520
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:27,856
But his Y-chromosome
matches the DNA
in the rape kit.

521
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,022
Which means one thing.

522
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:31,623
His son, Gavin Sipes,
is our rapist.

523
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:34,636
Well, this time the AUSA
should turn him over
without a fight.

524
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:36,672
I don't think
she'd do anything
without one.

525
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:38,934
Gavin Sipes
is a protected witness
by default

526
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:40,305
because of his
father's testimony.

527
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:43,777
Just go reason
with Ms. Williams
and close this file.

528
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:47,282
And if that doesn't work?
Arrest her.

529
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,448
What do you want now?

530
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,750
Your office said
you'd be here.
What happened?

531
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:55,688
Well, as far
as I can tell,
a recent immigrant

532
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:58,625
refused to pay
her protection fee.

533
00:20:58,694 --> 00:21:00,218
There are two bodies.

534
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:01,923
Innocent bystander.

535
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:04,296
You can see now
what I'm up against.

536
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:05,698
So what do you need?

537
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:06,792
Gavin Sipes.

538
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:07,961
You sure?

539
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:09,834
DNA doesn't Iie.

540
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,805
Gavin a diabetic?
Yes.

541
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:13,068
Hand him over.

542
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:15,975
Gavin Ieft our program
and our protection.
I don't have him.

543
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:17,069
Since when?

544
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:19,114
Since we moved his father
and he refused to go.

545
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:21,342
Said he had enough running
to Iast him for a Iifetime.

546
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:23,214
Didn't you find
that strange?
No.

547
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:24,947
Protectees exit
the program all the time.

548
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:26,215
You know,
we can't force them to join,

549
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:27,916
we can't stop them
if they want to Ieave.

550
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,787
PIus, he's an adult now.

551
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,224
Children Ieave
when they grow up.

552
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:33,091
So at Ieast
Iet us talk to Peter.

553
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:34,220
He'II know
where his son is.

554
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:36,265
It wouldn't do
any good.

555
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:38,391
They've severed
all contact.

556
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,833
From now on,
all phone calls and visits

557
00:21:40,903 --> 00:21:43,599
are coordinated and monitored
by the Marshal's Service.

558
00:21:43,673 --> 00:21:45,664
CIaudia, Gavin's not
going to stop,

559
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:48,608
and I hope
you're not hiding him
for Daddy's sake.

560
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:50,612
Now, why
would I do that?

561
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,875
To keep your witness
happy and talking.

562
00:21:56,452 --> 00:21:58,215
Look for bad habits.

563
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:00,812
Gavin has a gambling problem.

564
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,324
But you didn't hear
that from me.

565
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,428
Gavin has racked up
a Iot of debt.

566
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:11,489
$10,000, $20,000
at a time.

567
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:15,367
So far, Peter has paid
about $100,000
in debts to Atlantic City.

568
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:18,134
How can he afford that?
Well, he can't.

569
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,198
They're behind
in the gym Iease

570
00:22:20,276 --> 00:22:22,210
and the rentals
of the equipment.

571
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:23,336
Check this out.

572
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:25,880
New Jersey house
has three mortgages on it.

573
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:30,044
Yeah. $600 and $700 charges
on credit cards.

574
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,913
AII at the same restaurant?

575
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:36,489
You're sure about that?
Okay, thanks.

576
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,322
Vice says the place
is a known front

577
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:40,692
for an underground
gambling club downtown.

578
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:43,391
People can pay off their debts
by charging it to credit cards

579
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:45,195
for wine and filet
mignon dinners.

580
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,734
Russian restaurant?
No, it's Italian.

581
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:48,360
Now, the LUDs
from Jersey,

582
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:50,962
Iook at that,
a Iot of calls from downtown.

583
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:54,936
The Iast payment
was made a while ago.

584
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:58,204
Maybe they're not
too happy about that.

585
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,644
NYPD, Benson, Stabler.
Move aside.

586
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,211
Detectives, I'm Joe Tucci.
Tell me how I can help you.

587
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:08,688
CIose down.

588
00:23:10,526 --> 00:23:12,517
This is an illegal club.

589
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:14,619
You're not from Vice.

590
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:18,463
Vice? I don't need to be
from Vice to ruin your day.

591
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:20,434
Causing you trouble sounds
Iike fun to me.

592
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:22,528
STABLER:
I'm gonna make the call,
get the ball rolling.

593
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:25,233
Now, what can I do
to make this right?
PIease.

594
00:23:25,307 --> 00:23:26,968
Gavin Sipes.

595
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,134
He Iikes poker.

596
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,838
He Iikes it a Iot.
But he's not very good at it.

597
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:32,471
You found a Iot of money
coming your way.

598
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:34,516
Must've made you mad
when it stopped.

599
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,574
Sometimes people
need convincing.
Yeah?

600
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:39,917
So what'd you do?
You called Peter up?
Threatened his son's Iife?

601
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:42,253
You watch too many movies.
Dead men don't pay up.

602
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:43,882
AII right, come on,
stop screwing around.

603
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,119
Come on,
tell me what you need.

604
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:47,219
When's the next payment,
who's making it?

605
00:23:47,296 --> 00:23:49,526
Peter called.
He's worried about his kid.

606
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:51,327
He's due here Iater
to talk over terms.

607
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,389
Well, what's he
so worried about

608
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:53,867
if you're such
a nice guy?

609
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:56,302
I'm a businessman.
Peter understands that.

610
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,806
His kid seems Iike
the type to try to skip.

611
00:23:58,874 --> 00:24:00,205
I had to make it clear
to the old man,

612
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:01,868
his boy walks
into any gambling joint

613
00:24:01,944 --> 00:24:04,640
anywhere in
this country, I'II know.
It won't be pleasant.

614
00:24:04,713 --> 00:24:06,806
How much
does he owe?

615
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:09,112
400 grand
and still counting.

616
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,177
We're just
gonna stick around

617
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:13,653
and wait till Dad shows up,
if you don't mind.

618
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,888
My son didn't do this.

619
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:19,689
You knew he was guilty
after we talked to you.

620
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:21,787
He's the diabetic.

621
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:23,593
We need to know
where he is right now.

622
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,894
This is all my fault.

623
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:27,663
He stays out there,
the next woman could die.

624
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:29,863
I wish I knew
where he was.

625
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:33,471
Attacking these women,
gambling debts.

626
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,737
He's in so deep,
I don't know how to fix it.

627
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:38,609
STABLER: How old was he
when you went
into the program?

628
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,114
EIeven.

629
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:43,015
We were moved
five times in 10 years.

630
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:45,417
Every time,
he had to Iearn a new name.

631
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:48,685
New Iies for his past,
fit into a new school.

632
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:51,920
He missed so much
that finally
he just quit trying.

633
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,621
How can a Iittle boy
grow up to be a man

634
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:55,721
when he has no idea
who he really is?

635
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:56,992
What happened
to his mother?

636
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,624
Anna? Died.

637
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:03,371
That was before
we came into the program.

638
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:06,875
In fact, she was the reason
why I approached the Feds.

639
00:25:08,177 --> 00:25:10,543
The Russians murdered her?

640
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:12,808
Punishment for skimming.

641
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,850
I used to be a chemist.

642
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:18,045
I was approached
by the Mikaelian Organizatsya

643
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,452
for a smuggling scam.

644
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:23,083
They moved millions of gallons
of grain alcohol to Europe

645
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:25,217
disguised as mouthwash.

646
00:25:25,294 --> 00:25:27,922
I taught them
how to extract the blue dye.

647
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:29,259
It was very successful.

648
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:32,198
And then it was gas tax,
Medicaid fraud and extortion.

649
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:33,667
But you're the one
who got greedy,

650
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:35,897
so why kill your wife
instead of you?

651
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:37,165
Anna handled the money.

652
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,706
When she was caught
stealing from the family,

653
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:41,004
they killed her for it.

654
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,101
They were willing to do that
to their own flesh and blood,

655
00:25:43,178 --> 00:25:44,907
what were they going to do
to me and my son?

656
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,574
So that's how
you got involved.
You married into it.

657
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,676
We met during the vodka scam.
After we married, I...

658
00:25:50,753 --> 00:25:54,655
I rose very quickly
to vory v zakonye.

659
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,422
What does that mean?

660
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:59,223
I'm what's known
as a thief-in-Iaw.

661
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,628
Then there's about 500 eagles.

662
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:04,064
The rest are
Iieutenants, counselors.

663
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:07,035
AII in all, there's about
5,000 members in the US,

664
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:09,537
mostly assimilated
and accent free.

665
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:12,734
Not as organized
as the Italians,
but getting there.

666
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:14,436
So why did Gavin
target those women?

667
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:16,445
How did he even know
who they were?

668
00:26:16,513 --> 00:26:19,209
I told him everything
about the Russians here,

669
00:26:19,282 --> 00:26:21,614
in FIorida and in California.

670
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:24,051
I kept a record of everybody
I ever did business with.

671
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,917
Names, people I met.

672
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:27,217
He deserved to know the truth

673
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,383
about what his mother
and I did,

674
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:32,155
what he'd sacrificed
his Iife for.

675
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:36,426
Peter, the mob's
gonna wise up pretty soon,
if they haven't already.

676
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:39,127
He's targeting their women.
Now, what do you think
they're gonna do to him?

677
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:40,965
They're not gonna do
anything. He's gonna hide.

678
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:43,198
I cut him off.

679
00:26:43,306 --> 00:26:45,274
I'm broke. I can't pay
his bills anymore.

680
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:47,742
Which means
he's a dead man.

681
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:50,974
He's got an addiction.
He can't Iay Iow for Iong.

682
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:54,679
If you Iove him, turn him in.

683
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:08,125
The Marshals are bringing
him to me today.

684
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:12,396
Supervised visit,
before they move me
one more time.

685
00:27:18,942 --> 00:27:21,672
AII I ask is that
you don't hurt my son.

686
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:27,843
Here's the warrant.

687
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,886
I've notified the Iocals
in Connecticut, you'II be
in their jurisdiction.

688
00:27:30,954 --> 00:27:32,421
Get any calls
from the US
Attorney's office?

689
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:33,547
No, nothing.

690
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:34,851
So much for cooperation.

691
00:27:34,924 --> 00:27:36,084
We'II be able
to take custody

692
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,888
as soon as the US Marshals
pull up with our rapist.

693
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:41,294
AII right, just keep it clean.
I don't want some fight
with the Feds over injuries.

694
00:27:41,364 --> 00:27:44,561
We're gonna Ieave.
We'II get a two-hour jump.

695
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:46,625
I'm here till it's done.

696
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:53,868
Car.

697
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,216
STABLER: That's him. Let's go.

698
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:16,863
Dad!
Oh, my God.

699
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,059
Dad!

700
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:20,630
No!

701
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:22,463
Dad!

702
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,032
Drop it! Do it now!
NYPD.

703
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,202
Drop the gun!
Drop it!

704
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:29,802
I said drop it.
Hold up. We're cops.

705
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:32,712
I don't give a damn.
Drop it or I'II drop you.

706
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,060
Both of you,
on the ground.

707
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:47,255
Move!

708
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:50,523
You, too.
On the ground.

709
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,806
Get their guns
and cuff them.

710
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:03,072
GAVIN: Oh, God.

711
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:11,753
I already told you
what happened.

712
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:13,812
Tell it to me again.

713
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:15,681
How'd you get the address?

714
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,283
Peter Sipes
gave it to me.

715
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,520
Then it's convenient
for you he's dead

716
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:20,290
since we can't
corroborate your story.

717
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:22,024
Yeah, that's one way
of Iooking at it.

718
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:23,929
No, that's how it is.

719
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:27,462
Well, this is crazy,
and I'm due a phone call.

720
00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:28,970
Who else did you talk to?

721
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:30,062
No one.

722
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:34,438
Who else besides
the gambling club owner,
Joe Tucci?

723
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:37,071
I already answered
the question.

724
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:39,775
Did you interrogate
a Michael Kerring?

725
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:42,182
We did.

726
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:45,119
Were you aware that he
was a criminal associate
from California

727
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:46,485
who knew Sipes' identity?

728
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:47,716
Yes.

729
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,622
And yet you still
pursued him,

730
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:50,920
even though
you knew the deceased

731
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:52,723
to be a federally
protected witness

732
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:54,991
and that you were
endangering his Iife.

733
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:56,258
Is that correct, Detective?

734
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:59,733
We were pursuing
a rape suspect,
Gavin Sipes.

735
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:01,293
His father
gave us the address.

736
00:30:01,371 --> 00:30:03,362
We were there to do our job.

737
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,373
And yet two men are dead.

738
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:07,671
One a Deputy US Marshal

739
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:09,678
with a wife
and three children.

740
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:17,052
How much do you
make a year?

741
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,183
It depends on overtime,
but why don't we say $68,940.

742
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:25,591
Must be hard to make ends meet
with a family of six.

743
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:29,563
I'm a cop.

744
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,868
And the NYPD has a history
of being squeaky clean.

745
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:41,540
I want my phone call.

746
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:45,240
We can hold you
for up to 72 hours
without giving you one.

747
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:47,610
Fallout from 9/11.

748
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:50,143
Who else
did you talk to?

749
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,244
I'm done talking.

750
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:52,913
Charge me or Iet me go.
Have a seat.

751
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:55,685
You know we had nothing
to do with the hit.

752
00:30:55,758 --> 00:30:57,817
I'm not confessing,
so why don't you
just let me go?

753
00:30:57,894 --> 00:30:59,691
You think I don't use
these tactics myself?

754
00:30:59,762 --> 00:31:02,595
I can make you
sit down,
Detective Stabler.

755
00:31:02,665 --> 00:31:03,962
Up to you.

756
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:09,066
You are officially
under investigation
by the FBI.

757
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:13,336
Your police jackets
and your financial records
have been subpoenaed.

758
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:15,843
New York Police Department
has been duly notified.

759
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:19,143
Internal Affairs is running
a concurrent investigation
into the matter.

760
00:31:19,215 --> 00:31:20,978
This is a witch hunt
and you know it.

761
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,779
You Iost a witness
so you need someone to blame.

762
00:31:22,852 --> 00:31:26,185
Two men are dead.
I told you to back off.
You didn't. You pay.

763
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:27,553
You can't connect us
to these murders.

764
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:28,784
We had nothing
to do with it.

765
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:30,018
You could've sold
the information,

766
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:32,653
or your bush Ieague tactics
could have Ied
the killers there.

767
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:34,026
Either way, you're culpable.

768
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:36,156
STABLER: Yeah? How?
Michael Kerring.

769
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:38,166
He ID'd Peter Sipes.

770
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:39,531
He's in Iockup
in our squad room.

771
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:42,435
Not anymore. They took
him away yesterday
for his arraignment.

772
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:45,599
He is now serving
30 days in Rikers
for shoplifting,

773
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:48,872
where he has access
to phone privileges
and the general population.

774
00:31:48,945 --> 00:31:51,914
If Michael Kerring
ratted out Sipes,
we're not responsible.

775
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:54,677
I disagree.
Now if you don't mind,
I'm busy.

776
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:56,013
Yeah, we're not done yet.

777
00:31:56,085 --> 00:31:58,383
You arrest Gavin Sipes?
You read him his rights?

778
00:31:58,454 --> 00:31:59,716
No.

779
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,918
Then bring him
on in here. Now.

780
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:06,086
I can't. I sent him
to your precinct hours ago.

781
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:18,663
Gavin Sipes, he processed?

782
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:20,436
Three counts rape
in the first degree.

783
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,206
Just waiting on transport
to the Tombs.

784
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:25,446
How you holding up?

785
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:28,109
Denied my civil Iiberties,
treated Iike some skell,

786
00:32:28,184 --> 00:32:29,913
suspected of conspiracy
to commit murder.

787
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:32,079
But, you know,
I think I've hit bottom.

788
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:34,419
IAB was here
digging for dirt.

789
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:36,649
I think I spoke too soon.

790
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:38,489
How bad is it?

791
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:41,960
US Attorneys
get a Iot of Ieeway
to make their cases.

792
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:44,397
The burden of proof
rests mostly
on the defendants.

793
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,957
But we did nothing wrong.

794
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:48,629
As Iaw enforcement officials,
you were well aware
of the risks

795
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:51,173
and you disregarded them
for your own benefit.

796
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,208
CIaudia could argue
that sensitive information

797
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:55,039
was passed on
to the criminal element.

798
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:57,306
Why would we do that?
What's our motive?

799
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,677
They don't need
to prove motive.

800
00:32:58,748 --> 00:33:00,375
In your zeal to show up
federal officers,

801
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,010
a witness
and a US Marshal are dead.

802
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:05,316
That's all a jury
needs to hear.

803
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:07,083
If the Feds can't make
a criminal case,

804
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:12,219
you're still gonna have
to face the brass.
And they could boot you.

805
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:15,856
I'm not just handing over
my tin without a fight.

806
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:17,797
I don't expect you to.

807
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:22,662
(SIGHING)

808
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,765
We gotta find out
who killed Peter Sipes
to clear our name.

809
00:33:28,177 --> 00:33:30,577
Munch, what do we have
on your witness,
Michael Kerring?

810
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:31,908
Did he talk to anybody
at Rikers?

811
00:33:31,981 --> 00:33:33,005
He made some calls.

812
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:35,050
STABLER: To who?
One to Brighton Beach.

813
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:37,985
Go sit him down.
Shake him up
if you have to.

814
00:33:38,054 --> 00:33:40,284
Don't sweat it.
We got your back.

815
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:43,223
Who else do we think
could have pulled this off?

816
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,317
That guy at the club
had a Iot of muscle.

817
00:33:45,395 --> 00:33:47,829
And access
to professional hitters.

818
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,933
I didn't do
anything wrong.

819
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:58,235
Phone call went to a woman
named Beana Wolfman
in Brighton Beach.

820
00:33:58,307 --> 00:34:02,266
Yeah. She's my girlfriend.
I begged her to get me
out of here. She refused.

821
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:04,370
She said she was tired
of wasting her money on me.

822
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:05,914
Smart girl.
So what's the problem?

823
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:07,472
You talk to her
and she'II tell you.

824
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,609
We already did.
Then why the third degree?

825
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:12,245
Ms. Wolfman
works in a restaurant
that's owned by the mob.

826
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:14,619
Turns out she has to
because she's here illegally.

827
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,918
What better way
to get her out from under

828
00:34:15,992 --> 00:34:17,892
than to pass on
some valuable information?

829
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,222
You don't know
what you're talking about.

830
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:21,422
The Organizatsya
does not work that way.

831
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:22,589
Then explain it to us.

832
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:24,428
They don't Ieave Ioose ends.

833
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,061
If I had talked,
someone in here
would've killed me already.

834
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:35,034
Hey, step back.

835
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:38,412
You wanted me
to set you up with some chips,
you just had to ask.

836
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:40,039
STABLER: You're
a generous guy there, Joe.

837
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:41,606
What gives?

838
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:44,346
Send some of your boys
to do a Iittle house cleaning?

839
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,388
Like what?
Like murder.

840
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:48,481
Peter Sipes
was killed yesterday.

841
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,287
It wasn't me.
I think it was.

842
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:52,486
You had about 400,000
reasons to kill him.

843
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:54,029
You don't know
what you're talking about.

844
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:55,155
The account's been closed.

845
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:57,597
Oh, just Iike that,
it's closed?

846
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, the debt was paid
in full not an hour
after you Ieft.

847
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,096
By who?
Gavin Sipes.

848
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:05,606
In cash.

849
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:07,666
You wanna get off me now?

850
00:35:17,253 --> 00:35:19,153
How's your glucose Ievel?

851
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:21,383
You need some insulin?

852
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:22,956
I got time.

853
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,858
What's your real name?

854
00:35:26,896 --> 00:35:28,158
Nikolai.

855
00:35:29,465 --> 00:35:30,727
Nikolai.

856
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:34,759
It fits you.
Names are important.

857
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:36,429
I've had several.

858
00:35:37,173 --> 00:35:39,937
I was Joshua for a while.
David, Daniel.

859
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,644
I was even a Thomas
for a whole nine days.

860
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:44,771
Why such a short time
with Thomas?

861
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:45,939
I screwed up.

862
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:49,642
I forgot our cover story.

863
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,880
So for once,
I just told the truth.

864
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:56,117
How old were you
when that happened?

865
00:35:56,192 --> 00:35:57,250
Thirteen.

866
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:01,087
Everyone was upset.

867
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:03,632
My dad, the Marshals,
the attorneys.

868
00:36:05,368 --> 00:36:07,700
They told me
it cost a fortune to move us.

869
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,262
If I kept running my mouth,
it would get us killed.

870
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,070
That's a hell
of a Iot of guilt for a kid.

871
00:36:15,378 --> 00:36:18,006
Childhood's the time
to make mistakes.

872
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,843
Not in the program.

873
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:22,307
When we first went in,

874
00:36:22,385 --> 00:36:25,354
Dad would sit
against the window
with a gun.

875
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:28,647
He never slept.

876
00:36:29,992 --> 00:36:32,893
He'd have panic attacks,
so we didn't go out.

877
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,466
I used to ask him why,
why we Iived Iike that,

878
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:39,831
and all he'd say
was "someday."

879
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,865
When did he
finally come clean?

880
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:45,634
When I got my GED.

881
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:50,645
We moved around so much,
I couldn't even get a Iousy
high school diploma.

882
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:52,908
I had to take a test
with a bunch of Iosers,

883
00:36:52,982 --> 00:36:55,143
pretending that it was
gonna change our Iives.

884
00:36:55,218 --> 00:36:58,710
Well, maybe he wanted you
to be proud of him
for doing the right thing,

885
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:02,588
to Iet you know
that your sacrifice
meant something.

886
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:05,888
What he wanted was for me
to make him feel better

887
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:08,192
about screwing me
out of a future.

888
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:10,824
Is that when you
decided to get even?

889
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:13,859
Get even for what?

890
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:15,927
For getting screwed
by your parents.

891
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:18,270
Especially your mother.

892
00:37:19,342 --> 00:37:21,810
You can't hold a grudge
against the dead.

893
00:37:21,877 --> 00:37:23,174
Oh, sure you can.

894
00:37:24,046 --> 00:37:27,243
She died on you
before you could vent
your anger.

895
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:30,882
Your mother betrayed you.

896
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:33,717
Both your parents
betrayed you.
No.

897
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:37,424
No? So why are you
raping innocent women

898
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:40,929
in some Iocal
mob boss's Iife?

899
00:37:41,597 --> 00:37:43,656
Innocent?
Yeah.

900
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:47,169
Petra was a stripper,
Iiving off the proceeds
of Sergei's victims.

901
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:49,862
His sister, Tatiana, decided

902
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:52,840
where the illegals
would work off their debts.

903
00:37:52,908 --> 00:37:55,900
And Amanda
was washing off the blood
from their money.

904
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:59,610
Those bitches
Iost their innocence
way before I was even born.

905
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,918
Just too easy,
though, huh?

906
00:38:02,985 --> 00:38:04,953
Raping those women
couldn't even the score.

907
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:08,388
Nothing could make up
for those Iost years,
could it?

908
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:14,652
Is that why
your father had to die?

909
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:18,293
I don't know
what you're talking about.

910
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,562
Sure, you do.

911
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:22,834
What better way to get back
at your old man

912
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:26,739
than to turn him over
to the very people
that he's testifying against?

913
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:31,608
That's not how it happened.

914
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:32,773
No?

915
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:36,915
Then why call
a butcher shop
in Brighton Beach?

916
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:39,850
Why call the house
in Connecticut

917
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:41,355
where your father
is staying,

918
00:38:41,424 --> 00:38:44,052
if not to make sure
that he was home?

919
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:53,892
I didn't have the money,

920
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:56,403
and he wouldn't
give me any more.

921
00:38:59,308 --> 00:39:01,333
What was I supposed to do?

922
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:04,246
They were gonna kill me.

923
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:06,345
(STABLER SIGHING)

924
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:08,315
Yeah, and now we will.

925
00:39:09,552 --> 00:39:13,249
Murder of a Iaw
enforcement officer
is an automatic needle.

926
00:39:14,357 --> 00:39:15,688
I didn't think
that they were
gonna kill him.

927
00:39:15,758 --> 00:39:18,318
Sergei said
he just wanted
to talk to Dad.

928
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:27,302
You talked
to Sergei Perlman
yourself?

929
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,429
I met with his Iieutenant.

930
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:32,769
I was there
when he called him,

931
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:35,606
and I spoke to Sergei
on the phone.

932
00:39:45,187 --> 00:39:49,055
That's them.
CIaudia's not here.

933
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,854
Where the hell are they?

934
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:52,689
We gotta take them.

935
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:58,197
BENSON: Sergei Perlman.

936
00:39:58,267 --> 00:40:00,633
Are you
Sergei Perlman?
Yes.

937
00:40:00,703 --> 00:40:03,263
You're under arrest.
Step back, please.

938
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:04,829
You're under arrest
for the murders

939
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:07,705
of Peter Sipes
and Deputy US Marshal
Raymond Lee.

940
00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:09,005
You have the right
to remain silent.

941
00:40:09,078 --> 00:40:11,638
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of Iaw.

942
00:40:11,714 --> 00:40:12,942
You have the right
to an attorney.

943
00:40:13,015 --> 00:40:15,279
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

944
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:17,717
Do you understand
these rights?

945
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:24,119
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

946
00:40:24,894 --> 00:40:26,156
Stabler.

947
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:41,174
PARAMEDIC: Heads up.
Watch your back,
watch your back.

948
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:54,281
You arrest Sergei Perlman?

949
00:40:54,356 --> 00:40:56,381
He's in Central Booking now.

950
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:57,448
We're gonna have to
vacate the charges.

951
00:40:57,526 --> 00:40:59,517
We're gonna have to
Iet him walk.

952
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:01,586
Yeah.
What happened?

953
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:04,098
Shooter entered the courtyard
masking as a guard.

954
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:07,431
Opened fire
with an automatic weapon.

955
00:41:07,503 --> 00:41:08,765
Russian?

956
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,033
No ID, but I'd bet
my Iife on it.

957
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:13,141
Sergei had to buy
the information

958
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:15,109
on Gavin's transfer
in order to pull this off.

959
00:41:15,177 --> 00:41:17,145
He had to get it
from someone inside.

960
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,407
Probably.

961
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:22,049
What's your next move?

962
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:24,452
That's just it, Detective.

963
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,681
I don't have one.

964
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,188
CIaudia.

965
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:37,031
If you need anything...
