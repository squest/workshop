NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:04,932
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,166
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:09,039
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:12,773
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,816
These are their stories.

(RUSTLING)

8
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,496
Armando,
wake up.

9
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:31,054
What?
Shh. Someone's
in the house.

10
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,534
Call 91 1.

11
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:36,470
I can't
find the phone.

12
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:38,597
Just get in
the closet.

13
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:57,752
(BOTTLES RATTLING)

14
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,201
Is that you, Itsy?

15
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:13,537
(PANTING)

16
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,508
Who the hell
is Itsy?

17
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:17,238
Who the hell
is she?

18
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,409
No ID.
Can't tell me
her name.

19
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:23,576
Can't
or won't?

20
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:26,888
I think Granny's only
knitting with one needle,
if you catch my drift.

21
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:29,890
Well, she came in
through a window, so she was
pretty desperate to get in.

22
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,688
Well, she thinks
she Iives here, apparently
with someone named Itsy.

23
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:33,887
And you canvassed
the building?

24
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,554
Yeah.
No one knows her.

25
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:37,597
Yeah, Granny Doe
made herself
right at home.

26
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,963
That's her coat
on the rack.

27
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:40,592
Okay. Thanks.

28
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,063
Why are all
these men here?

29
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:45,665
I'm not decent.

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,469
It's okay, ma'am.

31
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:49,136
It's okay.

32
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:50,303
PIease.
Make them Ieave.

33
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:51,777
AII right.

34
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:57,014
I'm Detective Benson.
Can you tell me
what happened?

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,515
I have to talk to Itsy.

36
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:03,183
Okay. Is Itsy the one
that hurt you?

37
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:07,258
You don't know anything,
do you?

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,530
Just what
Itsy told me.

39
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:15,126
She promised not to tell.

40
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:18,996
Well, that's because
she wants you to tell me.

41
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:20,598
What happened?

42
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:28,175
He had his way with me.

43
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,547
Who did?

44
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:34,655
Ma'am, may I?

45
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,467
Did you see that?

46
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:50,266
Yeah. Someone used her
for an ashtray.

47
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:39,954
Was she raped?

48
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,683
No abrasions or fluids,
you'II have to wait
for the kit.

49
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:46,853
But she had 12 raw burns
to her breasts and genitals.

50
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,122
She was in shock
when we talked to her.

51
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,527
You think
she'II remember
more details?

52
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:50,724
I doubt it.

53
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,996
Her head CT
and MRI are clear,
no sign of infection.

54
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,536
She probably
has AIzheimer's.

55
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:56,866
So, no short-term memory.

56
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:58,064
Any way to
kick-start it?

57
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,630
Damage done
is irreversible.
She's in here.

58
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,404
She hasn't been
admitted yet?

59
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:05,241
No need to.
She has mild
high blood pressure.

60
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:09,374
Nothing more serious.
I gave her Silvadene Iotion
for her burns.

61
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:12,011
This woman needs
supervised care.

62
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:16,786
Long-term. We don't provide
that here. I just need
someone to release her to.

63
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,861
Do you feel up to
talking now?

64
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,659
Oh, where's my purse?

65
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,264
Look, what happened
to my purse?

66
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,301
You didn't have one
with you.

67
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:28,461
Did you take it
when you went out?

68
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,766
Well, I had my purse here
10 minutes ago.
Of course I had my purse.

69
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,500
We'II help you
Iook for it.

70
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:33,768
Did it have
your name in it?

71
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:35,173
Of course it had
my name in it.

72
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:36,870
Okay.
What was the name?

73
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:39,140
I don't know.
Whatever.

74
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:42,081
What could have happened
to my purse?

75
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,014
Well, what's it to you?
You took my purse.

76
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,613
You make her
give me back
my purse.

77
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,488
I promise you,
she didn't take
your purse.

78
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:54,551
Yes, she did. She did take
my purse. Nobody else
could have taken my purse.

79
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,028
You give me back
my purse.

80
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:59,089
Maybe the person
who hurt you
took your purse?

81
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:04,968
Were you attacked in
your home? Or someplace else?
Can you remember?

82
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,671
I was in my bedroom.
I was... I was asleep,
and I...

83
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:12,304
I was asleep in my bedroom
and I...

84
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:15,144
I woke up and...

85
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,211
He pushed up my nightgown.

86
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:23,015
He was in there.

87
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,590
Oh, it hurt so bad.

88
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:35,830
I tried to hit him.
I tried to push him off,

89
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,301
but I couldn't move.

90
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,467
BENSON: Did you know
your attacker?

91
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:47,713
Who was it?

92
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,145
It was...

93
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,611
STABLER: How did he get
in the house?

94
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,656
Well, he stays there.

95
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,484
He stays there?
Why?

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,587
Well, he stays there
because he Iost all his money
investing it.

97
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:08,436
He drinks every night.
Whiskey.

98
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:12,238
Oh, he smells so awful
when he...

99
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,937
Okay.
We can help you.

100
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,600
I don't Iike it
when he comes
upstairs to me.

101
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:19,340
We can help you,
but you've got to
tell us his name, okay?

102
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,676
(MUTTERING)

103
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:29,050
Who?

104
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,627
It's sad.

105
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:42,393
Frightening. When this
steel trap starts to rust,
call Kevorkian.

106
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,233
Consider that done.

107
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:48,139
Have Adult Protective Services
pick her up.
Where are we on her ID?

108
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,677
We re-canvassed
the building and did
a sweep of the neighborhood.

109
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:51,734
No one's
claiming her.

110
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:54,008
Well, she said
her abuser
Iives with her.

111
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:56,277
MUNCH: Yeah, so
he won't be calling
Missing Persons.

112
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,581
Well, how far could
this Iady have gone
in her nightie?

113
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:02,145
She broke into that apartment
for a reason. She must have
Iived there at some point.

114
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,157
Manager's been there
20 years.
He's never seen her.

115
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,388
That building's been there
at Ieast a hundred.
Go back further.

116
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,698
The 1930 census
was just unsealed this year.

117
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:20,406
I can give you the name, age,
sex and race of any person
at any address.

118
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:24,912
Assuming they weren't paranoid
conspiracy freaks with
a wicked big-brother complex.

119
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,540
Well, that's why it's sealed
for 72 years, to cover
the average Iife span.

120
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:32,609
Actually, 72 is the
average man's Iife span.
A woman's is 79.

121
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,917
Oh, a man
who knows his stats.

122
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,951
Did you know the 1930 census
takes 2,667 rolls of...

123
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:43,520
Yo, stop, stop, stop.
Okay. There's Seventh.
Back up.

124
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:47,760
There's Sixth
and there's
the building, 213.

125
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:50,396
Yeah. Apartment 1-A.
The Staytons.

126
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:52,337
EIIsworth, Hilda

127
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:57,244
and three daughters,
Lilith, 11, Isabel, 10,
and Millie, eight.

128
00:07:57,712 --> 00:08:00,510
Today they'd be 83,
82 and 80.

129
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:03,312
She's gotta be
one of these three girls.

130
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:05,813
STABLER: This isn't Lilith
or Isabel?

131
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,913
MILLIE: No, both my sisters
passed on.

132
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:14,793
Lily in '92
and cancer took Izzy
back in '78.

133
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:16,353
You called Isabel
"Izzy"?

134
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,092
Everyone did.

135
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,157
No one ever
called her "Itsy"?

136
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:23,500
Dear Lord,
Itsy and Bitsy.

137
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:26,233
I haven't thought
about her in years.

138
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,831
Who was Bitsy?

139
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:31,970
A neighbor girl
down the street.
Isabel's best friend.

140
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:36,383
It was Bitsy for Bess.
Bess Maclntyre.

141
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:37,679
Did Bess ever
Iive with you?

142
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:42,246
No, no. But sometimes
she'd sneak over
in the middle of the night.

143
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,653
Poor thing,
cry herself to sleep.

144
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:49,497
She would wake up
your whole family
in the middle of the night?

145
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:52,761
Oh, no, no,
she'd sneak in
through a window.

146
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:54,963
Why was she crying?

147
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:59,334
I was too young
to understand at the time,

148
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:03,741
but Bess had what we used
to call a "funny uncle."

149
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:07,975
Mother never Iet us play
at her house the whole time
he Iived there.

150
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,286
(WHISPERING) I got it, thanks.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,025
I'm sorry,
did I wake you?

152
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,028
Who are you?

153
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,801
I'm OIivia. Remember?

154
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,175
And I'm sorry,
do you go by Bitsy
or Bess now?

155
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:39,805
Bess.

156
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:42,607
We've never met.

157
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:46,151
We had a Iong talk
this morning.

158
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:49,218
After the hospital?

159
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:51,982
I never go to a hospital.

160
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:56,959
I'm a very healthy person.
I am healthy as a...
As a horseshoe.

161
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,828
What is this place?

162
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:02,863
Why am I here?

163
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,996
You're in a police station.

164
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,640
I was arrested?

165
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,109
No, no, no.
You were attacked.

166
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:14,876
You said that it was
the man staying with you.

167
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:18,248
The man
who Iost all his money
in the stock market.

168
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,622
Were you talking
about your uncle?

169
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,319
What year
did he Iose
all his money?

170
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:36,132
What year did he Iose
all his money? He Iost his
money in 1929. Everybody did.

171
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:39,833
Bess, that was over
70 years ago.

172
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:45,105
Your uncle hurt you
when you were Iittle. Tell me,
who is hurting you now?

173
00:10:57,425 --> 00:11:01,293
Well, in the small favors
category, her rape kit
came back negative.

174
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:04,126
You Iook at those burns
and tell me this skeev
did her any favors.

175
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,928
Looks Iike
the doc's done with her.
What'd you get?

176
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,902
The attack definitely
triggered memories
of her childhood molestation.

177
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:13,304
So she fled to the only
safe harbor she could think
of, her friend Isabel's home.

178
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,365
She'd sneak through
the window Iike
she did Iast night.

179
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:17,070
Who is she running from?

180
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:18,874
I doubt she's ever gonna
be able to tell you.

181
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,244
So we just solved
a 70-year-old rape case.

182
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:25,081
Uncle Ted was arrested in '53
on five counts of rape,
but not for Bess.

183
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:26,745
He was killed in prison
in '57.

184
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,016
Well, somebody tortured her
again Iast night

185
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,887
and I'm pretty sure
it wasn't the dead uncle.

186
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,482
So, who are we Iooking for?

187
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,357
A sadist.
He enjoyed the torture,

188
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,057
though I'm not sure
if it was sexual
or anger-based.

189
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,065
He's young
or socially stunted.

190
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,897
He chose an enfeebled woman
because of feelings
of inadequacy.

191
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,903
I tracked Bess
through Social Security.

192
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:47,532
Her checks are sent care of
Jubilee Towers on Madison.

193
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:53,080
Nice place
for a nursing home.

194
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:56,583
We're not a nursing home.
We're an assisted
Iiving facility.

195
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,845
Hello. Hope Garrett.
Hi.

196
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,649
Assistant Administrator.
How may I help you?

197
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:04,590
I'm Detective Benson.
This is my partner,
Detective Stabler.

198
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:08,459
Are you aware
that one of your residents
went missing Iast night?

199
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,963
Well, it couldn't have been
anyone from the nursing wing

200
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:15,162
because they're checked
on a regular basis.
Let's see. Uh...

201
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,470
Yes, all our Level One-ers
are accounted for.

202
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,973
You do bed checks?

203
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:24,603
The residents are required
to flip a switch
every morning,

204
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,613
just to Iet us know
that they're still with us.

205
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,310
Well, I can guarantee you
Bess Sherman did not flip
her own switch today.

206
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:31,408
How could she have?

207
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:34,683
Mrs. Sherman was released
about two weeks ago.

208
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,251
To whom?

209
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,486
Her son.
Joe Sherman.

210
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:45,488
Mr. Sherman?

211
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,364
These folks have a warrant.
I'm Ietting them in.

212
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:49,960
He's usually home from work
about now.

213
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,026
Nice place.

214
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,231
No, it's his mother's.

215
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,831
Rent-controlled.
$350 a month,
you believe that?

216
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:56,137
Mr. Sherman smoke?

217
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,905
Only in between
the times he quits.

218
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:00,607
How's Joe been getting along
with his mother
since she moved back in?

219
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,308
AII I know is
she sure brought him
some Iuck.

220
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:03,407
How so?

221
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,679
Well, ever since
she came back,
the repo men stopped coming,

222
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:07,277
deliveries started.

223
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,220
Deliveries.
What kind of deliveries?

224
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:15,259
Big-screen TV came in
over the weekend.
Couch, chairs, the media unit.

225
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:18,730
Got all the bells
and whistles, CD, DVD,

226
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,530
stereo, video, got a TiVo.

227
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:22,930
EIIiot.

228
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:25,634
Really fixed
this place up.

229
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,640
Except for this room.

230
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,940
Bess' room,
I'm assuming.

231
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:33,003
Looks more
Iike her cell.
Check this out.

232
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,342
Explains
the restraint marks.

233
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:37,316
Joe didn't want to Iose
his Iucky charm.

234
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,910
Who are you,
and what are you
doing here?

235
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,821
Police. Just checking out
your mother's accommodations.

236
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,290
Well, where is she?
Is she okay?

237
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,556
She's safer than she was
in this place. Let's go.

238
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,421
I wanna see my mother.
When we're done.

239
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,296
Have a cigarette.
I don't smoke.

240
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,267
Really?
We heard you did.
I quit.

241
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,826
Could I see her
right now?

242
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,997
As soon as
you explain these.

243
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:00,830
She never
bruised before.

244
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,308
It's some way
to treat your mother.

245
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,470
She wanders at night.
It's for her own protection.

246
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,640
Protection? But
you don't protect her
from this.

247
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,149
Oh, my God!

248
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,753
Oh, my God.

249
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:21,562
Well, you don't think
I burned her?

250
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,290
Actually, we do.

251
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,662
Well, then
you're more confused
than she is.

252
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,669
Obviously some pervert
attacked her on the street
when she got out.

253
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:31,364
BENSON: But you didn't notice
she was gone.

254
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,101
I had an early
breakfast meeting.
I didn't want to wake her.

255
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:37,303
But you don't mind
Ieaving her tied up
to a bed for 18 hours?

256
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,369
Now, how was she supposed
to use the bathroom?

257
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:42,575
Look, the housekeeper
takes care of that.
Maria comes in every morning.

258
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,618
She makes Mom breakfast.
She wakes her up.

259
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:45,947
But she didn't come
this morning.

260
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,750
No. I don't know why
Maria didn't call me.
And believe me, she's fired.

261
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,087
Well, we'II take care of
that for you.
What's her Iast name?

262
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,182
Her name is Sanchez.

263
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,625
You know, your mother
would've been just fine

264
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,821
if you hadn't pulled her
from that nice
retirement community.

265
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:59,492
They were draining her.
She paid those crooks
seven grand a month.

266
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,592
Leaving
nothing for you.

267
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:06,538
AII right, you know what?
I'm done. So you either
charge me, or you Iet me go.

268
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,002
And I'm gonna
take my mother with me.

269
00:15:13,014 --> 00:15:15,141
No way we're releasing Bess
into his custody.

270
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:17,184
He's her Iegal guardian.

271
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:18,610
He's her abuser.

272
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:20,176
According to whom?

273
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,155
You have no witnesses,
and the victim
can't make a complaint.

274
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:25,158
Look, we suspect
a parent of abuse,

275
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:27,251
Child Services doesn't
need the victim's complaint.

276
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:29,159
The Iaw assumes
a child can't speak up
for itself.

277
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,063
CRAGEN: Neither can Bess.
And her son
is strapping her to a bed.

278
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,260
A Iawyer could argue
he believed
it was a reasonable,

279
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:36,803
albeit very misguided,
attempt to keep Bess safe.

280
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:40,932
Look, AIex,
there's gotta be some way
to get this guy on neglect.

281
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,272
In an attempt to ensure
her safety, he endangered her.
It's a stretch.

282
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:50,408
Well, then stretch it
into an order of removal.

283
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,610
We'II stall Joe.

284
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,023
What's the problem now?

285
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,889
I have a protective order
to place your mother
back in Jubilee Towers

286
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:00,292
until this matter
is straightened out.

287
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:01,556
My mom
belongs with me.

288
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,427
The courts
disagree with you.

289
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:06,558
Mom. Mom,
would you tell them
that I did not hurt you?

290
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:08,728
Why is it so noisy
in here?

291
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:11,132
I'm gonna sue
every one of your asses.

292
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:12,605
Lawyers are
mighty expensive, Joe.

293
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:16,405
Here's a protective order
freezing your mother's
accounts and assets.

294
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,241
You can't do that.

295
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:21,341
Mom, don't you worry,
I am gonna bring you home!

296
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,112
Captain, got any tissues
for me? I'm about
to break out into tears.

297
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:26,780
Hey, escort Mr. Sherman
out the back.

298
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:31,591
We'II see if we can
dig up any dirt
from the neighbors,

299
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,493
see if Maria the housekeeper
even exists.

300
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,521
BENSON: Maria Sanchez?

301
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,059
Yes.

302
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:43,328
You work for Joe Sherman,
take care of his mother,
Bess?

303
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:44,997
Yes, what's wrong?

304
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:47,405
BENSON: Did you go to work
yesterday?

305
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:50,906
No one was there.
I thought maybe
he took her to the doctor.

306
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:54,073
She ran away sometime
the night before. Could you
come up here, please?

307
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,743
We'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

308
00:16:57,552 --> 00:17:00,578
Do you have any idea
what she was running from?

309
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:03,588
You ever see
any marks or bruises
on Mrs. Sherman?

310
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:04,682
No.

311
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:07,090
Did you ever see
Mr. Sherman hurt her?

312
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:10,290
No, but when things
are stressful, he speaks
very harsh with her.

313
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:12,299
Was he stressed out
Monday?

314
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:15,996
Very. Everything had to be
just perfect for his party.

315
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:21,840
JOE: I invited
a few investors over.

316
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,605
You failed to mention it.
It wasn't relevant.

317
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:26,112
I can assure you
that none of them
touched my mother.

318
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,342
Delway Furniture Rentals
says your Visa
was declined.

319
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:29,782
Send them a check.
But the bank called...

320
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,978
Just deal with it.
Business troubles?

321
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:35,615
Police harassment.
You shut us down
when you froze our accounts.

322
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,180
I think you mean
your mother's accounts.

323
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,160
This is a start-up business,
my mother's a key investor.

324
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:43,220
What about
those big investors
at your party?

325
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:44,589
Don't go near them.

326
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,691
Why, they see something
you don't want us
to hear about?

327
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:48,998
Maybe Mom wandered out,
caused a scene,
embarrassed you?

328
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:51,596
So you drove home
the burning importance
of being a silent partner.

329
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:52,765
Why are you
trying to destroy me

330
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:55,639
when the monster
who tortured my mother
is still out there?

331
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,144
Joe, just cough up
the party Iist.

332
00:17:58,213 --> 00:18:01,376
No way in hell
you're ever gonna get
that Iist.

333
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:06,812
Damn it to hell,
you got crap
all over my shoes.

334
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:09,186
If you wanna bitch,
switch places.

335
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:10,884
(EXCLAIMING)

336
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:14,228
This one's full of rancid
salmon puffs.

337
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:16,059
FIN: Maybe they didn't go over
too big at Joe's party.

338
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,393
You sure it's Joe's?

339
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:18,694
Incoming.

340
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:22,863
Housekeeper said she threw out
three bags with yellow ties.
We gotta check all of them.

341
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,166
Well, here's a Lick magazine

342
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,230
with Joe's address on it.

343
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:29,166
Hair dye for men.

344
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:34,404
And something that's
best applied anally.

345
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,851
Stop jerking around
and find the guest book.

346
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:43,213
Hello!

347
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,622
Names?

348
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:48,526
Cigarette butts.
One of them's
gotta be our weapon.

349
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:53,931
You're keeping me busy,
Detectives. Forty-five
cigarette butts in all.

350
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,102
Five different brands.

351
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:58,696
Any way to match
the butts to the wounds?

352
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:01,867
If we were talking about
cigars or slims.

353
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:05,346
Unfortunately, most brands
are identical in size,

354
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:08,177
so there's no way
to narrow down
by wound diameter.

355
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,582
Just need to prove
that the attack took place
in that apartment.

356
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,313
Any way to find
flesh residue?

357
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:13,684
Well, at
the point of inhalation,

358
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:18,215
the burn zone temperature
is around 850 and 900 degrees.

359
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:20,557
Seared away
all the evidence.

360
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:23,359
DNA from
saliva on the filters
will take weeks to run.

361
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:25,626
We're screwed.
Not really.

362
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:27,801
Fingerprints.

363
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:30,669
Ninhydrin.

364
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:36,269
I'II spray them all
and then I'II run them
through the system.

365
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,744
We already
checked out Joe,
no priors.

366
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:42,874
Yeah, but maybe not all
his mystery smoking guests
are as clean.

367
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:47,217
Investing in one of these
is Iike buying a Monet.

368
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,453
It's easy on the eyes
as it gains in value.
Will you excuse me, please?

369
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:52,515
Hi, there!

370
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:53,686
Hugh Wilkins?

371
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:55,319
How can I help you?

372
00:19:55,397 --> 00:19:56,058
By fessing up.

373
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,965
The Tychon Food Chopper,

374
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:01,731
it couldn't really
slice and dice a beer can,
now, could it?

375
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:03,271
Sure it could.

376
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:06,934
Of course, you have to follow
the instructional video,
sold separately.

377
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,067
How did you...

378
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:11,580
When you got bonded to sell
that crap door-to-door,
you gave up your prints.

379
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,105
We found one on
a cigarette butt you Ieft
at Joe Sherman's party.

380
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:17,516
Did you have any trouble
with his moms that night?

381
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:21,182
His mother?
I never even saw her.
What's this about?

382
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:22,451
Joe.

383
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,652
Yeah.
What's his racket?

384
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:29,289
Oh! The Trifecta Wizard.
It's an unbeatable
horseracing software program.

385
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:33,362
Unlike his other
get-rich-quick schemes,
this one was "a sure thing."

386
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:35,631
His other ventures
stumble out of the gate?

387
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:38,799
Habitually.
You should ask Joe about
his IIama ranch in Texas.

388
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:39,932
That one even
scared off his mother.

389
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,271
She was an investor?

390
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:43,812
Up until two years ago,
she was
his principal backer.

391
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:46,279
After that, she had to
guard what was Ieft
of the nest egg.

392
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,407
She cut
the purse strings.

393
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:48,814
That must have
pissed Joe off.

394
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:50,181
Well, he went broke.

395
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:54,485
But then the old Iady
moves back in, Io and behold,
he has start-up money again.

396
00:20:56,392 --> 00:21:01,022
According to everyone
we spoke to, Joe has been
a Ieech his entire Iife.

397
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,622
Right behind you,
speak of the devil.

398
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:08,363
Look, I asked you to stay away
from my investors.
Three just pulled out.

399
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:10,029
And we're only through
half the Iist.

400
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,095
JOE: You're ruining me.

401
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:12,834
Like you were
ruining your mother?

402
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:15,206
We pulled
her financials, Joe.

403
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:18,270
The only money
I ever took from her
was rent.

404
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:20,377
Five times a month?

405
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:23,316
AII made to cash.

406
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:25,115
Let me see those.

407
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,214
(SIGHS)

408
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,314
Andy.

409
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:29,483
FIN: He your bookie?

410
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,187
My college dropout son.
He's talked her into
writing checks before.

411
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:35,093
And was Andy
at the party?

412
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:38,565
He stopped by, uninvited,
with one of his
deadbeat friends.

413
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:39,828
He needed a place
to sober up.

414
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:41,164
They spend the night?

415
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:44,206
No. I gave him just an hour.
Told him to stay in the den,
out of sight.

416
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,706
Where does
your son Iive?

417
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:47,538
Jersey.
With his mom.

418
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:50,672
Now will you Ieave
my investors alone?

419
00:22:06,662 --> 00:22:08,220
What the hell?

420
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:10,996
ANDY: Who Iet you in?
Your mother.

421
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,466
We heard you were
on the party circuit.

422
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:13,866
What?

423
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:16,063
Dad's?
Monday night?

424
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:19,198
I don't call
being exiled to
the broom closet a party.

425
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:23,109
We also heard that
your dad wasn't too proud
of his dropout son.

426
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:25,079
Dropout?
Is that what he said?

427
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:26,614
STABLER: What do you say?

428
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:31,119
My gran set me up with
a college trust fund. I had to
drop out when Dad drained it.

429
00:22:31,187 --> 00:22:33,553
AII he Ieft me with
is a ratty old
IIama-hair coat.

430
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:36,523
Yeah? And now Gran
won't write out
any more checks.

431
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,116
That must've
pissed you off.

432
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:41,129
I'm not pissed at Gran.
It's my dad who's a jerk.

433
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:43,324
I'm the only one
who ever visited her
at the home.

434
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,730
You see her
at the party?

435
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,233
Of course I did.

436
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:49,637
She write you out
any more checks?

437
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:51,806
Sometimes
she gives me presents.

438
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:55,708
She doesn't even know
her own name. Must take
some prodding on your part.

439
00:22:57,113 --> 00:23:01,072
She's the only person
in my Iife who ever gave
a crap about me.

440
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:03,041
I would never,
ever hurt her.

441
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,053
What about that guy
that you hang out with?

442
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:06,713
Hal?
Yeah. Does he smoke?

443
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:07,983
Yeah.

444
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:10,719
Was he ever alone
with your gran
at the party?

445
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:11,817
I don't know.

446
00:23:11,894 --> 00:23:13,156
You don't know.

447
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:15,493
I might have
nodded off a bit.
Mmm-hmm.

448
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:20,201
Where can we find
this Hal?

449
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:21,634
At work.

450
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:26,163
Jubilee Towers,
where my gran was.
That's where we met.

451
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:28,272
He took care of her.

452
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:31,205
Leave me alone!
Stop it!

453
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,804
You can't make me!

454
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:34,349
Let go,
Mr. Leonard!

455
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,748
(CRASHING)

456
00:23:35,818 --> 00:23:37,012
Idiot!
Look what you did!

457
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:39,384
Hey, Hal,
calm down.

458
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,685
Who are you?
We're the police.

459
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:43,816
Sir, are you okay?

460
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,793
He's trying to kill me.

461
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:47,488
What do you want?

462
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,320
Are you always this good
with the patients?

463
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:51,662
Help me,
don't Iet him
take me away.

464
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,168
Don't you worry,
nobody's taking
anybody anywhere.

465
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:56,898
Oh, please,
don't encourage him.
This happens every day.

466
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:59,839
Mr. Leonard hates needles.
But he is going to chemo.

467
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:02,571
We need to talk.
In private.

468
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:04,613
Look, I've got three patients
Iate for appointments

469
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,705
and I've had nothing
but troublemakers all day.

470
00:24:06,782 --> 00:24:07,840
Troublemakers?

471
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:10,681
How about Bess Sherman?
She one of your troublemakers?

472
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:12,414
HAL: No, she's a dream.

473
00:24:13,923 --> 00:24:17,654
We heard
you ran into her
on the outside.

474
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:22,356
With the end
of a cigarette butt.
Maybe that rings a bell.

475
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:25,760
I don't know
what you guys
have been smoking,

476
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:27,928
but I've got
Iives to save.

477
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,276
Jubilee Towers adheres
to the highest standards
of safety.

478
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:44,183
Even we
non-medical employees
are trained in CPR.

479
00:24:44,253 --> 00:24:47,347
Well, have the safety
standards been slipping since
Hal started working here?

480
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:48,617
Are all of those
complaints?

481
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:50,056
You have to understand

482
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:54,186
that many patients
will complain if you just
Iook at them wrong.

483
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:55,321
Hal's worked here
a year.

484
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:57,797
He's only had
one serious complaint
against him.

485
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,027
Which was what?

486
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:02,901
Well, Mr. Jackson
accused Hal of trying
to suffocate him.

487
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,397
Well, did you
call the police?

488
00:25:05,474 --> 00:25:07,635
Uh...
Mr. Jackson is senile.

489
00:25:07,943 --> 00:25:09,410
Well, did you
at Ieast check on it?

490
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:12,879
Of course I did,
but we found nothing.

491
00:25:12,948 --> 00:25:14,313
You have to realize

492
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:18,444
that fiction and reality
blend in the mind
of some of our patients.

493
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:22,321
You know, we get rape reports
after the enema cart
makes its rounds.

494
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:27,090
Hal didn't strike me
as a real people person. Now,
why hire someone Iike that?

495
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:29,062
It's a very Iow-paying job.

496
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:32,498
Not a Iot of people find
changing adult diapers
rewarding.

497
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:34,331
What else
is in the file?

498
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:37,429
Just incident reports,
on-duty injuries...

499
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:38,597
Whoa, whoa.

500
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:40,073
Hal injured
patients?

501
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:42,440
No, patients
injured him.

502
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:46,574
Mr. Jackson?

503
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:47,809
Yeah?

504
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:50,745
You the nude models
I ordered?

505
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:53,583
No. Actually we're...
That was a joke.

506
00:25:53,656 --> 00:25:55,385
What can I do you for?

507
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:56,755
Heard you had
problems with Hal,
the nurse's aide.

508
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:58,760
That man's
a serial killer.

509
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:00,489
Tell us about it.

510
00:26:00,564 --> 00:26:04,796
He pinches me all the time.
One day I bit him, real hard.

511
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:07,098
Son of a bitch
cut off my oxygen,

512
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,764
whispered,
"You're gonna die soon,
old man."

513
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,101
And nobody
did anything
about it?

514
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:13,870
MR. JACKSON: Hell, no.
Took his word over mine.

515
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:17,004
Well, we believe you.
He done anything
since then?

516
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,207
Sheet people scared him off.

517
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:23,609
Who?
You know who I mean.

518
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:28,249
KIan comes at night,
roams the halls.
Better watch your back.

519
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:36,056
Okay. We had Mr. Jackson
till he took a Ieft
at Mississippi.

520
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:39,124
Yeah, but even paranoids
are right sometimes.

521
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,931
Oh, we know Hal.
A Iittle short
on the bedside manner.

522
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:47,500
STABLER: Okay. Well, we heard
you scratched his face.

523
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:49,272
Why?
I can't say for sure.

524
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:51,337
Oh, you know,
just tell them.

525
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:53,541
It was after
I broke my hip
Iast fall.

526
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:56,279
Yeah, taking
dancing Iessons
for that cruise.

527
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:59,322
Anyway,
when I came back
after surgery,

528
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:03,291
I woke up one night,
convinced that someone
was suffocating me.

529
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,418
Was it Hal?

530
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:06,485
Well, it sure
wasn't the morphine.

531
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:11,398
AII I know is that I thought
I was dying. I started
clawing at something.

532
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:13,333
Then, suddenly,
I could breathe again.

533
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:15,200
When I opened my eyes,

534
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:19,264
Hal was standing over me,
his face scratched
and bleeding.

535
00:27:19,342 --> 00:27:20,400
What'd he say?

536
00:27:20,477 --> 00:27:22,570
That I was hallucinating.

537
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,975
He pinches the patients,
hides their dentures,

538
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:29,314
and when he wants a real rush,
he plays keep-away
with their oxygen.

539
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:32,719
But here's the rub.
Every victim was either
doped up or senile.

540
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:34,279
Making them
the perfect victims.

541
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:37,349
Even if they remember
what happened, they're still
unreliable witnesses.

542
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:39,361
That's probably why
he took the job
in the first place.

543
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:41,420
He gets his rocks off
watching them suffer.

544
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:42,726
What do you got?

545
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,166
A notice of claim
filed six months ago
against Jubilee Towers.

546
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:47,533
A $10 million
negligence suit

547
00:27:47,604 --> 00:27:49,936
brought about by the estate
of a deceased former resident.

548
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:51,132
What happened?

549
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:54,438
Doesn't say.
A settlement was reached
with a nondisclosure clause.

550
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,138
Who was named in the suit?

551
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:58,442
Everyone the dead woman
came into contact with,

552
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:00,983
from the director
down to the Iowliest
of nurse's aides.

553
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:02,678
Including our pal Hal?

554
00:28:02,752 --> 00:28:04,413
This dead woman
have a name?

555
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,011
Dahlia Brown.

556
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,990
I'm already working
on an exhumation order.

557
00:28:11,928 --> 00:28:14,158
Not bad for nine months
in the ground.

558
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,891
Skin's perfectly intact.

559
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:18,456
She's Iost some muscle tone,
but haven't we all?

560
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:21,231
You know the day's coming
when embalming fluid
is put in a Iotion.

561
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:25,934
WARNER: Until then that time,
it will remain the medical
examiner's worst nightmare.

562
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:30,036
When the undertaker
flushed out her blood, he
also flushed away any toxins.

563
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:33,879
The embalming fluid then
dissolved any protein-based
poison in her organs.

564
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,508
Anything you
could test for?

565
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:37,815
Tissue toxicology,
heavy metals,

566
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:41,345
which came back negative
for arsenic, Iead and cyanide.

567
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:43,949
The death certificate
said cardiac arrest.

568
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:45,892
Which means
we don't know
what really happened,

569
00:28:45,962 --> 00:28:47,759
but we don't think
it was foul play.

570
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:50,299
The M.E.'s gotta put
something down
for cause of death.

571
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,890
What would you have put?

572
00:28:51,968 --> 00:28:55,597
I don't know,
but I certainly
would have mentioned this.

573
00:28:57,507 --> 00:29:00,943
A tiny pinprick hole
unaccounted for
in the medical records.

574
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,706
She was in the hospital wing.
Maybe they gave her an IV.

575
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,114
She was in to have
her knee drained.
The hole's in the wrong place.

576
00:29:08,184 --> 00:29:10,709
You settled with
the deceased's daughter.

577
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:12,277
Realize you made
a mistake?

578
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:15,153
No, it was cheaper
than going to court.

579
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:17,382
Well, then
what happened with Dahlia?

580
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,519
Well, grieving people
sometimes have trouble

581
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:21,894
accepting the death
of Ioved ones.

582
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:25,025
The pain makes them Iook
for someone to blame.

583
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:28,000
Well, speaking of which,
I noticed in Dahlia's records

584
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:32,405
that her Iast supper
was delivered by somebody
with the initials H.S.

585
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:37,402
STABLER: Any other nurses'
aides with those initials
besides Hal Shipley?

586
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:40,980
We're gonna need to speak
with anybody

587
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,110
who might have seen him
with Dahlia that night.

588
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,320
Okay.

589
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:48,854
Man, I don't want
to grow old.

590
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:51,393
In our Iine of work,
be careful what you
wish for. How'd you do?

591
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,258
No one remembers
any fireworks
between them,

592
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,388
but I did find out
a Iittle about Dahlia.

593
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:56,489
Great Iady,
Iousy patient?

594
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,329
When she was in pain,
she was a pain.

595
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:00,164
Needy and demanding,
Hal's favorite.

596
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:01,931
Yeah, he had means,
he had opportunity

597
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:04,838
with Bess, Dahlia,
Mr. Jackson, a dozen others.

598
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:07,399
That we know of.
He's Iike a psycho kid
in a candy store.

599
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:08,910
Time to take away
his candy.

600
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:10,912
Excuse me, where...
Room 410's coding.

601
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,208
Quick,
get the crash cart.

602
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:14,011
410 is Bess' room.

603
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,744
ANNOUNCER: Code blue
to room 410.
Code blue to room 410.

604
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,753
WOMAN: Hurry! In here!

605
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:19,247
Hope.

606
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:23,421
You were right.
I saw it was him.
He was...

607
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:26,462
Let's calm down.
Just take a breath
and tell us what happened.

608
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:28,224
After we talked,
I called Hal in

609
00:30:28,298 --> 00:30:31,927
and, you know,
I told him to finish
his shift and Ieave.

610
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,434
He wanted to know why,
and I told him.

611
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:35,528
I said, "It's because
of the way
you treat the patients."

612
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:37,300
And he was furious
and he just stormed out.

613
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:39,568
You can't help in there.
Now, did he make
any threats?

614
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:41,701
No, but after
what we talked about,
you know...

615
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:45,942
I was worried, so I came down
to check on Bess,
and that's when I saw him.

616
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:47,607
What was he doing?
He was just...

617
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:50,244
He was Ieaving the room,
but I didn't even think.

618
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,347
I just went in there
and her pulse was weak
and thready

619
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:57,359
and I just pushed
the code button
and started CPR.

620
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,552
Hold on, hold on.

621
00:30:58,628 --> 00:31:01,290
Bess?
NURSE: Move her
to the full-care wing.

622
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:03,257
I'm gonna go with her.

623
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,961
NURSE: Put her on a monitor
and start an IV.

624
00:31:07,103 --> 00:31:09,230
She had a fresh
needle mark.

625
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,641
What are you still
doing here?
We heard you were fired.

626
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:21,980
The pencil-pushing
bootlicker told me
to finish off my shift.

627
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:25,384
Account for
your whereabouts
for the Iast 15 minutes.

628
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:27,855
Stockroom.
Taking inventory.

629
00:31:27,924 --> 00:31:30,392
Let's go for a ride, Hal.
Am I under arrest?

630
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,519
No.
Then screw off.

631
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:35,628
Excuse me?

632
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:42,268
Whatever. Let's party.

633
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:54,912
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

634
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:56,508
Yeah, a big
tearful goodbye.

635
00:31:56,586 --> 00:31:58,383
Oh, you really don't
wanna miss this.

636
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:00,183
STABLER: You got
a Iatent print report?

637
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,451
Hal's known,
identified print.

638
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:05,585
From that Iast cig break
at the Towers.
You really shouldn't Iitter.

639
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:06,993
You can't do that.

640
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,997
Yeah, well, you
voluntarily discarded it.

641
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:11,090
Meaning Iegally,
your butt is ours.

642
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:14,295
As is this one,
retrieved from Joe Sherman's
party trash.

643
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,565
Well, that Iooks
Iike a match.
Seven-point.

644
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:19,301
We've got a bifurcation,
three ending ridges
and an island.

645
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,434
Lots of guys
were smoking
at the party.

646
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:24,912
Yeah? Well, how many
had seared flesh at the end
of their cancer sticks?

647
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:26,642
That we can match
to Bess Sherman.

648
00:32:26,716 --> 00:32:28,377
Uh... Where's the Iab
on the DNA?

649
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:29,941
I'm on my way there
right now.

650
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,509
Call us when you know.
When we have the results,

651
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:33,521
we won't need a confession
from pantywaist here.

652
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:35,648
No confession,
no plea bargain.

653
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:37,716
Which means
you do the max.

654
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:41,962
CSU said they couldn't
get flesh off
of the cigarette.

655
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:43,724
Oops.

656
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:48,235
Okay, I burned her.

657
00:32:48,304 --> 00:32:49,532
What?

658
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,998
I burned her.
Why?

659
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:55,435
It's not Iike
I planned it.

660
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:58,674
Andy owed me a Iot of money,
which he said he could get
from Grandma Bess.

661
00:32:58,748 --> 00:33:00,340
Owed you money
for what?

662
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,577
Nothing to do
with this.

663
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,784
He pulls a check
from her purse, says,
"You need to sign this, Gran."

664
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:08,016
Bam, she does.

665
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:10,321
So it's so easy,
you think you're gonna
try it yourself.

666
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:12,827
So you go back in,
get another check.

667
00:33:12,895 --> 00:33:14,157
And she yells, "Rape."

668
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,791
Just Iike she used to
at the home when
I'd help dress her. As if.

669
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:20,028
Your job sucked, we know.
No, you don't know!

670
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:23,129
I had to clean them
and feed them
and wipe up their crap.

671
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:24,639
STABLER: They owed you.

672
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:27,437
So all she had to do
was sign the other check.

673
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:31,776
But what does she do?
She screams? She tried
to get you in trouble.

674
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:37,119
So I go over
to quiet her down,

675
00:33:37,186 --> 00:33:39,381
and my cigarette
accidentally burns her chest.

676
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:42,151
And she starts screaming rape
at the top of her Iungs,

677
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:44,591
and I just...
I just snap.

678
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:48,089
I say,
"I'II show you rape."

679
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:51,099
And I pull up her nightgown

680
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,898
and I jab that cigarette
at her again and again
and again.

681
00:33:58,274 --> 00:34:00,868
What happened
when you saw her today?

682
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,470
I didn't see her today.

683
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:06,072
Sweetie, we've got a witness
who saw you Ieaving her room.

684
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:08,515
Then they were hallucinating.

685
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:12,076
When she coded,
I was in the stockroom.
I can prove it.

686
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:19,722
Hal's been hacking into
the drug computer. Son of
a bitch was stealing drugs.

687
00:34:20,163 --> 00:34:21,960
Maybe he fudged
the times.

688
00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:26,400
According to the tech, this
machine is Iike the Fort Knox
of drug dispensers.

689
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,494
Then he's covered.
His Iist of stolen
nurses' codes

690
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:31,369
matches perfectly
to what we found
in his Iocker.

691
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:33,602
Well, Hope swore
she saw him Ieaving
Bess' room.

692
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:36,543
So, if the computer's
not Iying...

693
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:39,638
Bess isn't the first patient
Hope has saved, you know.

694
00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:40,739
Really?

695
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:44,275
She found Mrs. Mercer
in cardiac arrest
Iast Christmas Eve.

696
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:46,378
Same situation?
She started CPR?

697
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:48,447
Can you imagine
a more depressing day
to die?

698
00:34:48,524 --> 00:34:49,786
Sounds Iike
a Christmas miracle.

699
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:51,588
I think there was
one other time.

700
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:53,288
Zona?
ZONA: Yeah?

701
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:55,694
Didn't Hope Garrett
save another patient before?

702
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:57,494
Oh. She tried.
The guy didn't make it.

703
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:58,693
No, this was a woman.

704
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:00,702
Remember, uh, senior prom?

705
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,930
Oh, yeah.

706
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:04,905
Senior prom
with the emphasis
on "senior"?

707
00:35:04,974 --> 00:35:07,499
It's a dance
the Level One-ers throw
every spring.

708
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:09,272
Their anti-youth
counterstatement.

709
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:13,475
You know, the punch always
gets spiked, somebody tries
to Iimbo and breaks a hip.

710
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:17,508
So this woman that Hope saved
was otherwise
a healthy dance casualty.

711
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:21,387
Well, she wasn't dancing.
She collapsed
at the buffet table.

712
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:24,190
It's a good thing
Hope knows her CPR.

713
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:28,160
I'm not gonna Iet
anybody else hurt you, Ma.
You're coming home with me.

714
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:30,290
You sure that's
in her best interest?

715
00:35:30,366 --> 00:35:31,856
Oh, I don't know,
maybe I'II throw her
back in

716
00:35:31,934 --> 00:35:33,993
with that Iunatic
who burned her,
Iike you did.

717
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,332
Dad, you're upsetting Gran.

718
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:36,837
JOE: No Iip from you.

719
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,203
You're the one that started

720
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:41,368
this whole thing by Ietting
that drug supplier
into my house.

721
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:42,775
I'II come by Iater, Gran.

722
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,608
I'II bring those brochures
of the other homes.

723
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,671
Sweet boy.

724
00:35:46,749 --> 00:35:49,479
Just so you know,
Hal's in custody. He won't be
hurting anybody else.

725
00:35:49,552 --> 00:35:50,985
Oh, you're so quick.

726
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:53,851
It only took two attempts
on my mother's Iife
for you to figure it out.

727
00:35:53,923 --> 00:35:55,117
You're my friend,
aren't you?

728
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:56,488
Yes, I am, Bess.

729
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,992
Make this man be quiet.

730
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,891
Don't you worry about it.
He's just Ieaving.

731
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:01,361
JOE: Guess again.

732
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,092
I was wrongly accused.
The protective order
was dropped.

733
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:06,397
Well, I hear that
the misappropriation
of funds investigation

734
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:08,300
is just beginning.

735
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:10,532
Uh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

736
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,733
No, you're welcome
anytime.

737
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:14,875
And thanks for
saving my mother's Iife.

738
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:17,606
Oh, well, Bess
is one of
our favorites.

739
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:21,182
No way
she's going anywhere
while I'm around.

740
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:26,378
So, you have saved,
what, three now?

741
00:36:26,756 --> 00:36:29,316
Including Bess,
yeah, I guess so.

742
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:30,951
And just that
one Ioss.

743
00:36:31,027 --> 00:36:32,289
Mr. Tazelo.

744
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:34,124
Yeah, what happened?

745
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:39,701
I was passing by X-ray and
there he was, just slumped
over in his wheelchair.

746
00:36:41,304 --> 00:36:43,795
So, he'd been Ieft
unattended?

747
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:46,341
I'm sure an aide
was on the way.

748
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,240
But he was alone
Iong enough
to die unnoticed.

749
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:50,142
Or was he still breathing
when you found him?

750
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:52,841
He was. I mean,
you know, he was dead.

751
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:55,283
But you still tried
to resuscitate him.

752
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,683
Well, I didn't know
how Iong
he'd been there.

753
00:36:57,753 --> 00:37:00,916
We bring people back
all the time. So, I just, um,

754
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:06,924
you know, pulled him
to the floor and started CPR.
I didn't want to give up.

755
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:09,965
They had to pull me off.

756
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:14,969
This woman
is a complete wacko.

757
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:17,267
It could be
malignant hero syndrome.

758
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,706
A person
sets up a risky situation
to create an emergency

759
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:21,140
and then comes out a hero.

760
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,609
Like a fireman
starting a fire.

761
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:26,011
It's all about personal gain.
In this case, attention,
prestige.

762
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:27,515
Like Munchausen by proxy.

763
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:31,075
She kills people
just to bring them back
to feel better about herself.

764
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:32,848
What was she
shooting them up with?

765
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:36,449
I picked up
Bess' tox screen report
from the hospital wing.

766
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:39,255
There's no poisons,
no anomalous drugs.

767
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,430
She had epinephrine
in her system.

768
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,694
That's what they give
when your heart stops,
right?

769
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:45,791
Exactly.

770
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:48,359
I guess that's why it's under
the "no big surprise" column.

771
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,200
Well, Hope revived Bess
with CPR.

772
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:54,004
Once her heart was started
again, she shouldn't have been
given epinephrine.

773
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:57,341
And according to
this chart, she wasn't.

774
00:37:57,413 --> 00:38:00,439
What would happen
if that was given to somebody
who had a healthy heart?

775
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:02,211
It would speed up
heart rate,

776
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:06,187
increasing cardiac output
and blood pressure
to a dangerous Ievel.

777
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:07,745
Mimicking a heart attack.

778
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:09,552
Perfect crime.

779
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:12,553
Son of a bitch.
Hope was a nurse.

780
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:15,720
She worked at
Oak GIade Nursing Home.

781
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:19,063
Her Iicense
was revoked
15 years ago.

782
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,727
FIN: On what grounds?

783
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:23,264
Gross negligence.

784
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,303
"Failed to dilute
potassium chloride doses."

785
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:34,848
It's cozy, isn't it?
An elevator adjacent. Do you
Iike to swim, Mr. Hamrick?

786
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:37,852
Because you're gonna Iove
the water aerobics class.

787
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,512
I hear that really gets
your heart rate up.

788
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:42,148
It's a hell of a Iot safer
than being injected
with epinephrine.

789
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:43,657
Is everything
all right?

790
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:46,217
Absolutely.
Excuse me one minute.

791
00:38:46,295 --> 00:38:48,661
EIIiot, OIivia. Um...

792
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:52,334
This probably isn't
a good time to talk
about the unpleasantness.

793
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:54,062
Oh, we don't plan
to discuss it here.

794
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:55,330
Good.

795
00:38:55,404 --> 00:38:58,396
A squad room would be
much more appropriate.

796
00:38:58,774 --> 00:39:01,072
Did something new
happen with Hal?

797
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:05,102
Well, our techs
pulled the used syringes
on the Sharps boxes here.

798
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:07,308
Hal's prints
weren't on
any of them.

799
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:09,715
Well, he had access to,

800
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:13,312
you know,
over a dozen boxes
of surgical gloves,

801
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,118
so maybe
he thought
to use a pair.

802
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:16,658
STABLER: You didn't.

803
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:21,493
They found your prints
on a syringe of epi in the box
at the nurses' station.

804
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:24,198
Well, you know Hal did it.
He confessed.

805
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:25,961
BENSON: To burning her.

806
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:30,768
But you didn't give a damn
about that as Iong as
you could grab the spotlight.

807
00:39:34,143 --> 00:39:37,169
Why are you trying
to embarrass me?
People can hear you.

808
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,544
Drama queen, you enjoy
being the center of attention.

809
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:42,311
Hope Garrett, you're
under arrest for the attempted
murder of Bess Sherman...

810
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,409
What are you talking about?

811
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,784
...and suspicion of murders
committed at
Oak GIade Nursing Home.

812
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:48,085
This is ridiculous, okay?
You have the right
to remain silent.

813
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:49,522
This is absolutely ridiculous.
It's a mistake.

814
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:52,152
If you give up that right,
anything you say...
This is a mistake!

815
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:57,630
I examined the records
of 22 deaths at Oak GIade

816
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,329
between May of 1982
and March of 1987.

817
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:03,269
And what did you find?

818
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:06,536
Evidence of
potassium poisoning
in seven of them.

819
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:09,537
Why wasn't this discovered
in any of their autopsies?

820
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:11,546
WARNER: People expect
the elderly to die.

821
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:15,277
An autopsy is performed
maybe one out of 25 cases.

822
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:17,251
CABOT: Well, surely
some of them were examined?

823
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:20,345
Yes, but when cells die,
they release potassium.

824
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:22,288
It would have been
impossible to detect.

825
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:23,620
So, how did you?

826
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:25,683
By examining
their EKGs.

827
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:28,389
Could you please
show us on the board?

828
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:34,468
AII showed tachycardia
and a widened QRS,
indicative of hyperkalemia.

829
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:36,300
CABOT: Uh...
In Iayman's terms?

830
00:40:36,372 --> 00:40:38,840
WARNER: Their hearts
were beating too fast.

831
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:42,271
Dr. Warner, what causes there
to be too much potassium
in the blood?

832
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:46,246
Kidney failure can,
or it was introduced
by an outside source.

833
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:48,483
Did any of them
have kidney disease?

834
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:51,816
No. Someone administered
Iethal doses.

835
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:54,583
Do you have any idea
how many mistakes
doctors make,

836
00:40:54,657 --> 00:40:56,249
how many times
I've covered their asses?

837
00:40:56,325 --> 00:40:57,587
Counselor,
you control your client,

838
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,093
or I'II have her removed
from this courtroom.

839
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:00,150
Yes, Your Honor.

840
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:03,027
JUDGE: The jury will disregard
the defendant's outburst.

841
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:04,998
The People may proceed.

842
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:07,101
One Iast question, Dr. Warner.

843
00:41:07,169 --> 00:41:10,764
In all these cases, how many
different administering nurses
were there?

844
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,740
Just one.
Hope Garrett.

845
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:14,708
Yes, but you
have to understand

846
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:16,870
every Iast one of them
was at death's door.
JUDGE: Counselor.

847
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:19,107
Your Honor, I'm sorry.
This won't happen again.

848
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:22,082
You know, I don't think
you realize how Iittle time
that they had Ieft.

849
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:23,982
I don't care if they were
on their very Iast breath.

850
00:41:24,053 --> 00:41:25,418
You had no right
to take it from them.

851
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:28,548
You don't understand.
I help people.
What do you do?

852
00:41:28,624 --> 00:41:30,421
You stupid bitch!
Hope!

853
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:33,087
This is not helping.
Court is recessed.
Bailiff, take the jury out.

854
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:35,687
How can you just sit there
and Iet them crucify me?

855
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:37,925
I don't need this, you know.
I'm Ieaving.

856
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:39,591
JUDGE: Court officers,
remove the defendant.

857
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:44,537
This is not fair. AII you
tell them about is
Oak GIade and Jubilee Towers.

858
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:47,474
But I've worked in homes
for 15 years in between.

859
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:48,840
And how many of them
did you kill?

860
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:50,902
I didn't kill anybody.

861
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,005
Maybe a few of them
wouldn't pull through for me,

862
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:55,482
but I have saved hundreds.
Hundreds.

863
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:58,679
And you don't even care
about them, do you?

864
00:41:58,754 --> 00:42:00,813
Take your hands off of me!

865
00:42:01,423 --> 00:42:02,890
Let go of me!
