NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:03,932
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,166
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:08,039
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:11,773
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,816
These are their stories.

(RUSTLING)

8
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,496
Armando,
wake up.

9
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:30,054
What?
Shh. Someone's
in the house.

10
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,534
Call 91 1.

11
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:35,470
I can't
find the phone.

12
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:37,597
Just get in
the closet.

13
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:56,752
(BOTTLES RATTLING)

14
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:09,201
Is that you, Itsy?

15
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:12,537
(PANTING)

16
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:14,508
Who the hell
is Itsy?

17
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:16,238
Who the hell
is she?

18
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:21,409
No ID.
Can't tell me
her name.

19
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:22,576
Can't
or won't?

20
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,888
I think Granny's only
knitting with one needle,
if you catch my drift.

21
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:28,890
Well, she came in
through a window, so she was
pretty desperate to get in.

22
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:31,688
Well, she thinks
she Iives here, apparently
with someone named Itsy.

23
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:32,887
And you canvassed
the building?

24
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,554
Yeah.
No one knows her.

25
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,597
Yeah, Granny Doe
made herself
right at home.

26
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,963
That's her coat
on the rack.

27
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,592
Okay. Thanks.

28
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,063
Why are all
these men here?

29
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:44,665
I'm not decent.

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,469
It's okay, ma'am.

31
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,136
It's okay.

32
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:49,303
PIease.
Make them Ieave.

33
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:50,777
AII right.

34
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:56,014
I'm Detective Benson.
Can you tell me
what happened?

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,515
I have to talk to Itsy.

36
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:02,183
Okay. Is Itsy the one
that hurt you?

37
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:06,258
You don't know anything,
do you?

38
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,530
Just what
Itsy told me.

39
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:14,126
She promised not to tell.

40
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,996
Well, that's because
she wants you to tell me.

41
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:19,598
What happened?

42
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:27,175
He had his way with me.

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,547
Who did?

44
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:33,655
Ma'am, may I?

45
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,467
Did you see that?

46
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:49,266
Yeah. Someone used her
for an ashtray.

47
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:38,954
Was she raped?

48
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:41,683
No abrasions or fluids,
you'II have to wait
for the kit.

49
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:45,853
But she had 12 raw burns
to her breasts and genitals.

50
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:47,122
She was in shock
when we talked to her.

51
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:48,527
You think
she'II remember
more details?

52
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:49,724
I doubt it.

53
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,996
Her head CT
and MRI are clear,
no sign of infection.

54
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,536
She probably
has AIzheimer's.

55
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:55,866
So, no short-term memory.

56
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:57,064
Any way to
kick-start it?

57
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,630
Damage done
is irreversible.
She's in here.

58
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,404
She hasn't been
admitted yet?

59
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:04,241
No need to.
She has mild
high blood pressure.

60
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:08,374
Nothing more serious.
I gave her Silvadene Iotion
for her burns.

61
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:11,011
This woman needs
supervised care.

62
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:15,786
Long-term. We don't provide
that here. I just need
someone to release her to.

63
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:20,861
Do you feel up to
talking now?

64
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,659
Oh, where's my purse?

65
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,264
Look, what happened
to my purse?

66
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:26,301
You didn't have one
with you.

67
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,461
Did you take it
when you went out?

68
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:29,766
Well, I had my purse here
10 minutes ago.
Of course I had my purse.

69
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,500
We'II help you
Iook for it.

70
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:32,768
Did it have
your name in it?

71
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,173
Of course it had
my name in it.

72
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:35,870
Okay.
What was the name?

73
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:38,140
I don't know.
Whatever.

74
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:41,081
What could have happened
to my purse?

75
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,014
Well, what's it to you?
You took my purse.

76
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,613
You make her
give me back
my purse.

77
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:50,488
I promise you,
she didn't take
your purse.

78
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,551
Yes, she did. She did take
my purse. Nobody else
could have taken my purse.

79
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,028
You give me back
my purse.

80
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:58,089
Maybe the person
who hurt you
took your purse?

81
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:03,968
Were you attacked in
your home? Or someplace else?
Can you remember?

82
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,671
I was in my bedroom.
I was... I was asleep,
and I...

83
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:11,304
I was asleep in my bedroom
and I...

84
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,144
I woke up and...

85
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:18,211
He pushed up my nightgown.

86
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:22,015
He was in there.

87
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,590
Oh, it hurt so bad.

88
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:34,830
I tried to hit him.
I tried to push him off,

89
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,301
but I couldn't move.

90
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:40,467
BENSON: Did you know
your attacker?

91
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:46,713
Who was it?

92
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,145
It was...

93
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,611
STABLER: How did he get
in the house?

94
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:54,656
Well, he stays there.

95
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,484
He stays there?
Why?

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,587
Well, he stays there
because he Iost all his money
investing it.

97
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:07,436
He drinks every night.
Whiskey.

98
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:11,238
Oh, he smells so awful
when he...

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,937
Okay.
We can help you.

100
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:14,600
I don't Iike it
when he comes
upstairs to me.

101
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:18,340
We can help you,
but you've got to
tell us his name, okay?

102
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,676
(MUTTERING)

103
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:28,050
Who?

104
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:37,627
It's sad.

105
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:41,393
Frightening. When this
steel trap starts to rust,
call Kevorkian.

106
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,233
Consider that done.

107
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:47,139
Have Adult Protective Services
pick her up.
Where are we on her ID?

108
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,677
We re-canvassed
the building and did
a sweep of the neighborhood.

109
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:50,734
No one's
claiming her.

110
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:53,008
Well, she said
her abuser
Iives with her.

111
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:55,277
MUNCH: Yeah, so
he won't be calling
Missing Persons.

112
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:57,581
Well, how far could
this Iady have gone
in her nightie?

113
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:01,145
She broke into that apartment
for a reason. She must have
Iived there at some point.

114
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:03,157
Manager's been there
20 years.
He's never seen her.

115
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:06,388
That building's been there
at Ieast a hundred.
Go back further.

116
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,698
The 1930 census
was just unsealed this year.

117
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:19,406
I can give you the name, age,
sex and race of any person
at any address.

118
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:23,912
Assuming they weren't paranoid
conspiracy freaks with
a wicked big-brother complex.

119
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,540
Well, that's why it's sealed
for 72 years, to cover
the average Iife span.

120
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:31,609
Actually, 72 is the
average man's Iife span.
A woman's is 79.

121
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,917
Oh, a man
who knows his stats.

122
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:38,951
Did you know the 1930 census
takes 2,667 rolls of...

123
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:42,520
Yo, stop, stop, stop.
Okay. There's Seventh.
Back up.

124
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:46,760
There's Sixth
and there's
the building, 213.

125
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:49,396
Yeah. Apartment 1-A.
The Staytons.

126
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,337
EIIsworth, Hilda

127
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,244
and three daughters,
Lilith, 11, Isabel, 10,
and Millie, eight.

128
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:59,510
Today they'd be 83,
82 and 80.

129
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:02,312
She's gotta be
one of these three girls.

130
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:04,813
STABLER: This isn't Lilith
or Isabel?

131
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:07,913
MILLIE: No, both my sisters
passed on.

132
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:13,793
Lily in '92
and cancer took Izzy
back in '78.

133
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:15,353
You called Isabel
"Izzy"?

134
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:17,092
Everyone did.

135
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,157
No one ever
called her "Itsy"?

136
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:22,500
Dear Lord,
Itsy and Bitsy.

137
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:25,233
I haven't thought
about her in years.

138
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:26,831
Who was Bitsy?

139
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:30,970
A neighbor girl
down the street.
Isabel's best friend.

140
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:35,383
It was Bitsy for Bess.
Bess Maclntyre.

141
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:36,679
Did Bess ever
Iive with you?

142
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:41,246
No, no. But sometimes
she'd sneak over
in the middle of the night.

143
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:44,653
Poor thing,
cry herself to sleep.

144
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:48,497
She would wake up
your whole family
in the middle of the night?

145
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:51,761
Oh, no, no,
she'd sneak in
through a window.

146
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:53,963
Why was she crying?

147
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:58,334
I was too young
to understand at the time,

148
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:02,741
but Bess had what we used
to call a "funny uncle."

149
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:06,975
Mother never Iet us play
at her house the whole time
he Iived there.

150
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,286
(WHISPERING) I got it, thanks.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,025
I'm sorry,
did I wake you?

152
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,028
Who are you?

153
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:32,801
I'm OIivia. Remember?

154
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:37,175
And I'm sorry,
do you go by Bitsy
or Bess now?

155
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:38,805
Bess.

156
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:41,607
We've never met.

157
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:45,151
We had a Iong talk
this morning.

158
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,218
After the hospital?

159
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:50,982
I never go to a hospital.

160
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:55,959
I'm a very healthy person.
I am healthy as a...
As a horseshoe.

161
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:58,828
What is this place?

162
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:01,863
Why am I here?

163
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,996
You're in a police station.

164
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,640
I was arrested?

165
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:09,109
No, no, no.
You were attacked.

166
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:13,876
You said that it was
the man staying with you.

167
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:17,248
The man
who Iost all his money
in the stock market.

168
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:21,622
Were you talking
about your uncle?

169
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,319
What year
did he Iose
all his money?

170
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:35,132
What year did he Iose
all his money? He Iost his
money in 1929. Everybody did.

171
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:38,833
Bess, that was over
70 years ago.

172
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:44,105
Your uncle hurt you
when you were Iittle. Tell me,
who is hurting you now?

173
00:10:56,425 --> 00:11:00,293
Well, in the small favors
category, her rape kit
came back negative.

174
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:03,126
You Iook at those burns
and tell me this skeev
did her any favors.

175
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:05,928
Looks Iike
the doc's done with her.
What'd you get?

176
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:08,902
The attack definitely
triggered memories
of her childhood molestation.

177
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:12,304
So she fled to the only
safe harbor she could think
of, her friend Isabel's home.

178
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,365
She'd sneak through
the window Iike
she did Iast night.

179
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:16,070
Who is she running from?

180
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:17,874
I doubt she's ever gonna
be able to tell you.

181
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:20,244
So we just solved
a 70-year-old rape case.

182
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:24,081
Uncle Ted was arrested in '53
on five counts of rape,
but not for Bess.

183
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:25,745
He was killed in prison
in '57.

184
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:28,016
Well, somebody tortured her
again Iast night

185
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,887
and I'm pretty sure
it wasn't the dead uncle.

186
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,482
So, who are we Iooking for?

187
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,357
A sadist.
He enjoyed the torture,

188
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,057
though I'm not sure
if it was sexual
or anger-based.

189
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:38,065
He's young
or socially stunted.

190
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,897
He chose an enfeebled woman
because of feelings
of inadequacy.

191
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,903
I tracked Bess
through Social Security.

192
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:46,532
Her checks are sent care of
Jubilee Towers on Madison.

193
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:52,080
Nice place
for a nursing home.

194
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:55,583
We're not a nursing home.
We're an assisted
Iiving facility.

195
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:56,845
Hello. Hope Garrett.
Hi.

196
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,649
Assistant Administrator.
How may I help you?

197
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:03,590
I'm Detective Benson.
This is my partner,
Detective Stabler.

198
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:07,459
Are you aware
that one of your residents
went missing Iast night?

199
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:09,963
Well, it couldn't have been
anyone from the nursing wing

200
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:14,162
because they're checked
on a regular basis.
Let's see. Uh...

201
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:18,470
Yes, all our Level One-ers
are accounted for.

202
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,973
You do bed checks?

203
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,603
The residents are required
to flip a switch
every morning,

204
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,613
just to Iet us know
that they're still with us.

205
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:29,310
Well, I can guarantee you
Bess Sherman did not flip
her own switch today.

206
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:30,408
How could she have?

207
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:33,683
Mrs. Sherman was released
about two weeks ago.

208
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,251
To whom?

209
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,486
Her son.
Joe Sherman.

210
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:44,488
Mr. Sherman?

211
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:47,364
These folks have a warrant.
I'm Ietting them in.

212
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:48,960
He's usually home from work
about now.

213
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:50,026
Nice place.

214
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:51,231
No, it's his mother's.

215
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,831
Rent-controlled.
$350 a month,
you believe that?

216
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,137
Mr. Sherman smoke?

217
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,905
Only in between
the times he quits.

218
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,607
How's Joe been getting along
with his mother
since she moved back in?

219
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,308
AII I know is
she sure brought him
some Iuck.

220
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,407
How so?

221
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,679
Well, ever since
she came back,
the repo men stopped coming,

222
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:06,277
deliveries started.

223
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:08,220
Deliveries.
What kind of deliveries?

224
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:14,259
Big-screen TV came in
over the weekend.
Couch, chairs, the media unit.

225
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:17,730
Got all the bells
and whistles, CD, DVD,

226
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,530
stereo, video, got a TiVo.

227
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:21,930
EIIiot.

228
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:24,634
Really fixed
this place up.

229
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:26,640
Except for this room.

230
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:28,940
Bess' room,
I'm assuming.

231
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:32,003
Looks more
Iike her cell.
Check this out.

232
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,342
Explains
the restraint marks.

233
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:36,316
Joe didn't want to Iose
his Iucky charm.

234
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:38,910
Who are you,
and what are you
doing here?

235
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:42,821
Police. Just checking out
your mother's accommodations.

236
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:44,290
Well, where is she?
Is she okay?

237
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:47,556
She's safer than she was
in this place. Let's go.

238
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,421
I wanna see my mother.
When we're done.

239
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:52,296
Have a cigarette.
I don't smoke.

240
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,267
Really?
We heard you did.
I quit.

241
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:55,826
Could I see her
right now?

242
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:57,997
As soon as
you explain these.

243
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,830
She never
bruised before.

244
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:02,308
It's some way
to treat your mother.

245
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,470
She wanders at night.
It's for her own protection.

246
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,640
Protection? But
you don't protect her
from this.

247
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,149
Oh, my God!

248
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:14,753
Oh, my God.

249
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:20,562
Well, you don't think
I burned her?

250
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,290
Actually, we do.

251
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,662
Well, then
you're more confused
than she is.

252
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:28,669
Obviously some pervert
attacked her on the street
when she got out.

253
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,364
BENSON: But you didn't notice
she was gone.

254
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:33,101
I had an early
breakfast meeting.
I didn't want to wake her.

255
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:36,303
But you don't mind
Ieaving her tied up
to a bed for 18 hours?

256
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:38,369
Now, how was she supposed
to use the bathroom?

257
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:41,575
Look, the housekeeper
takes care of that.
Maria comes in every morning.

258
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,618
She makes Mom breakfast.
She wakes her up.

259
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:44,947
But she didn't come
this morning.

260
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,750
No. I don't know why
Maria didn't call me.
And believe me, she's fired.

261
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:50,087
Well, we'II take care of
that for you.
What's her Iast name?

262
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:51,182
Her name is Sanchez.

263
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,625
You know, your mother
would've been just fine

264
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:54,821
if you hadn't pulled her
from that nice
retirement community.

265
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:58,492
They were draining her.
She paid those crooks
seven grand a month.

266
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,592
Leaving
nothing for you.

267
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:05,538
AII right, you know what?
I'm done. So you either
charge me, or you Iet me go.

268
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:09,002
And I'm gonna
take my mother with me.

269
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:14,141
No way we're releasing Bess
into his custody.

270
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:16,184
He's her Iegal guardian.

271
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:17,610
He's her abuser.

272
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,176
According to whom?

273
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:22,155
You have no witnesses,
and the victim
can't make a complaint.

274
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,158
Look, we suspect
a parent of abuse,

275
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:26,251
Child Services doesn't
need the victim's complaint.

276
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:28,159
The Iaw assumes
a child can't speak up
for itself.

277
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,063
CRAGEN: Neither can Bess.
And her son
is strapping her to a bed.

278
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,260
A Iawyer could argue
he believed
it was a reasonable,

279
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:35,803
albeit very misguided,
attempt to keep Bess safe.

280
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:39,932
Look, AIex,
there's gotta be some way
to get this guy on neglect.

281
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:46,272
In an attempt to ensure
her safety, he endangered her.
It's a stretch.

282
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:49,408
Well, then stretch it
into an order of removal.

283
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,610
We'II stall Joe.

284
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:56,023
What's the problem now?

285
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:55,889
I have a protective order
to place your mother
back in Jubilee Towers

286
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,292
until this matter
is straightened out.

287
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:58,556
My mom
belongs with me.

288
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,427
The courts
disagree with you.

289
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:03,558
Mom. Mom,
would you tell them
that I did not hurt you?

290
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:05,728
Why is it so noisy
in here?

291
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:08,132
I'm gonna sue
every one of your asses.

292
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:09,605
Lawyers are
mighty expensive, Joe.

293
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:13,405
Here's a protective order
freezing your mother's
accounts and assets.

294
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:15,241
You can't do that.

295
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:18,341
Mom, don't you worry,
I am gonna bring you home!

296
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,112
Captain, got any tissues
for me? I'm about
to break out into tears.

297
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:23,780
Hey, escort Mr. Sherman
out the back.

298
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:28,591
We'II see if we can
dig up any dirt
from the neighbors,

299
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,493
see if Maria the housekeeper
even exists.

300
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:34,521
BENSON: Maria Sanchez?

301
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:37,059
Yes.

302
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:40,328
You work for Joe Sherman,
take care of his mother,
Bess?

303
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:41,997
Yes, what's wrong?

304
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:44,405
BENSON: Did you go to work
yesterday?

305
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:47,906
No one was there.
I thought maybe
he took her to the doctor.

306
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:51,073
She ran away sometime
the night before. Could you
come up here, please?

307
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,743
We'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

308
00:16:54,552 --> 00:16:57,578
Do you have any idea
what she was running from?

309
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:00,588
You ever see
any marks or bruises
on Mrs. Sherman?

310
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:01,682
No.

311
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:04,090
Did you ever see
Mr. Sherman hurt her?

312
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:07,290
No, but when things
are stressful, he speaks
very harsh with her.

313
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,299
Was he stressed out
Monday?

314
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:12,996
Very. Everything had to be
just perfect for his party.

315
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:18,840
JOE: I invited
a few investors over.

316
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,605
You failed to mention it.
It wasn't relevant.

317
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:23,112
I can assure you
that none of them
touched my mother.

318
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,342
Delway Furniture Rentals
says your Visa
was declined.

319
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:26,782
Send them a check.
But the bank called...

320
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,978
Just deal with it.
Business troubles?

321
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:32,615
Police harassment.
You shut us down
when you froze our accounts.

322
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,180
I think you mean
your mother's accounts.

323
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:37,160
This is a start-up business,
my mother's a key investor.

324
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,220
What about
those big investors
at your party?

325
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:41,589
Don't go near them.

326
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,691
Why, they see something
you don't want us
to hear about?

327
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:45,998
Maybe Mom wandered out,
caused a scene,
embarrassed you?

328
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:48,596
So you drove home
the burning importance
of being a silent partner.

329
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:49,765
Why are you
trying to destroy me

330
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:52,639
when the monster
who tortured my mother
is still out there?

331
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,144
Joe, just cough up
the party Iist.

332
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:58,376
No way in hell
you're ever gonna get
that Iist.

333
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:03,812
Damn it to hell,
you got crap
all over my shoes.

334
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:06,186
If you wanna bitch,
switch places.

335
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:07,884
(EXCLAIMING)

336
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:11,228
This one's full of rancid
salmon puffs.

337
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:13,059
FIN: Maybe they didn't go over
too big at Joe's party.

338
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,393
You sure it's Joe's?

339
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:15,694
Incoming.

340
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:19,863
Housekeeper said she threw out
three bags with yellow ties.
We gotta check all of them.

341
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:21,166
Well, here's a Lick magazine

342
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,230
with Joe's address on it.

343
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:26,166
Hair dye for men.

344
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:31,404
And something that's
best applied anally.

345
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,851
Stop jerking around
and find the guest book.

346
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:40,213
Hello!

347
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,622
Names?

348
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:45,526
Cigarette butts.
One of them's
gotta be our weapon.

349
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:50,931
You're keeping me busy,
Detectives. Forty-five
cigarette butts in all.

350
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,102
Five different brands.

351
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:55,696
Any way to match
the butts to the wounds?

352
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:58,867
If we were talking about
cigars or slims.

353
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:02,346
Unfortunately, most brands
are identical in size,

354
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,177
so there's no way
to narrow down
by wound diameter.

355
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,582
Just need to prove
that the attack took place
in that apartment.

356
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,313
Any way to find
flesh residue?

357
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:10,684
Well, at
the point of inhalation,

358
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:15,215
the burn zone temperature
is around 850 and 900 degrees.

359
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,557
Seared away
all the evidence.

360
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:20,359
DNA from
saliva on the filters
will take weeks to run.

361
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,626
We're screwed.
Not really.

362
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:24,801
Fingerprints.

363
00:19:26,304 --> 00:19:27,669
Ninhydrin.

364
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:33,269
I'II spray them all
and then I'II run them
through the system.

365
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,744
We already
checked out Joe,
no priors.

366
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:39,874
Yeah, but maybe not all
his mystery smoking guests
are as clean.

367
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:44,217
Investing in one of these
is Iike buying a Monet.

368
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:48,453
It's easy on the eyes
as it gains in value.
Will you excuse me, please?

369
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:49,515
Hi, there!

370
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:50,686
Hugh Wilkins?

371
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,319
How can I help you?

372
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:54,058
By fessing up.

373
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,965
The Tychon Food Chopper,

374
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:59,731
it couldn't really
slice and dice a beer can,
now, could it?

375
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:01,271
Sure it could.

376
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:04,934
Of course, you have to follow
the instructional video,
sold separately.

377
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,067
How did you...

378
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:09,580
When you got bonded to sell
that crap door-to-door,
you gave up your prints.

379
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:13,105
We found one on
a cigarette butt you Ieft
at Joe Sherman's party.

380
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:15,516
Did you have any trouble
with his moms that night?

381
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:19,182
His mother?
I never even saw her.
What's this about?

382
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:20,451
Joe.

383
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:22,652
Yeah.
What's his racket?

384
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:27,289
Oh! The Trifecta Wizard.
It's an unbeatable
horseracing software program.

385
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:31,362
Unlike his other
get-rich-quick schemes,
this one was "a sure thing."

386
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:33,631
His other ventures
stumble out of the gate?

387
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:36,799
Habitually.
You should ask Joe about
his IIama ranch in Texas.

388
00:20:36,874 --> 00:20:37,932
That one even
scared off his mother.

389
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,271
She was an investor?

390
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:41,812
Up until two years ago,
she was
his principal backer.

391
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,279
After that, she had to
guard what was Ieft
of the nest egg.

392
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:45,407
She cut
the purse strings.

393
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:46,814
That must have
pissed Joe off.

394
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,181
Well, he went broke.

395
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:52,485
But then the old Iady
moves back in, Io and behold,
he has start-up money again.

396
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:59,022
According to everyone
we spoke to, Joe has been
a Ieech his entire Iife.

397
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:01,622
Right behind you,
speak of the devil.

398
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:06,363
Look, I asked you to stay away
from my investors.
Three just pulled out.

399
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:08,029
And we're only through
half the Iist.

400
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:09,095
JOE: You're ruining me.

401
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:10,834
Like you were
ruining your mother?

402
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:13,206
We pulled
her financials, Joe.

403
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:16,270
The only money
I ever took from her
was rent.

404
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:18,377
Five times a month?

405
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,316
AII made to cash.

406
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:23,115
Let me see those.

407
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:25,214
(SIGHS)

408
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,314
Andy.

409
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:27,483
FIN: He your bookie?

410
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,187
My college dropout son.
He's talked her into
writing checks before.

411
00:21:31,262 --> 00:21:33,093
And was Andy
at the party?

412
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:36,565
He stopped by, uninvited,
with one of his
deadbeat friends.

413
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:37,828
He needed a place
to sober up.

414
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:39,164
They spend the night?

415
00:21:39,237 --> 00:21:42,206
No. I gave him just an hour.
Told him to stay in the den,
out of sight.

416
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:43,706
Where does
your son Iive?

417
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:45,538
Jersey.
With his mom.

418
00:21:46,044 --> 00:21:48,672
Now will you Ieave
my investors alone?

419
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:06,220
What the hell?

420
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:08,996
ANDY: Who Iet you in?
Your mother.

421
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:10,466
We heard you were
on the party circuit.

422
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:11,866
What?

423
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,063
Dad's?
Monday night?

424
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:17,198
I don't call
being exiled to
the broom closet a party.

425
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:21,109
We also heard that
your dad wasn't too proud
of his dropout son.

426
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,079
Dropout?
Is that what he said?

427
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:24,614
STABLER: What do you say?

428
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:29,119
My gran set me up with
a college trust fund. I had to
drop out when Dad drained it.

429
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:31,553
AII he Ieft me with
is a ratty old
IIama-hair coat.

430
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:34,523
Yeah? And now Gran
won't write out
any more checks.

431
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:36,116
That must've
pissed you off.

432
00:22:36,194 --> 00:22:39,129
I'm not pissed at Gran.
It's my dad who's a jerk.

433
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:41,324
I'm the only one
who ever visited her
at the home.

434
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:42,730
You see her
at the party?

435
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,233
Of course I did.

436
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:47,637
She write you out
any more checks?

437
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:49,806
Sometimes
she gives me presents.

438
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:53,708
She doesn't even know
her own name. Must take
some prodding on your part.

439
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:59,072
She's the only person
in my Iife who ever gave
a crap about me.

440
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:01,041
I would never,
ever hurt her.

441
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,053
What about that guy
that you hang out with?

442
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:04,713
Hal?
Yeah. Does he smoke?

443
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:05,983
Yeah.

444
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:08,719
Was he ever alone
with your gran
at the party?

445
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:09,817
I don't know.

446
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:11,156
You don't know.

447
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,493
I might have
nodded off a bit.
Mmm-hmm.

448
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:18,201
Where can we find
this Hal?

449
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:19,634
At work.

450
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:24,163
Jubilee Towers,
where my gran was.
That's where we met.

451
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,272
He took care of her.

452
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,205
Leave me alone!
Stop it!

453
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,804
You can't make me!

454
00:23:30,882 --> 00:23:32,349
Let go,
Mr. Leonard!

455
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,748
(CRASHING)

456
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:35,012
Idiot!
Look what you did!

457
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:37,384
Hey, Hal,
calm down.

458
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:39,685
Who are you?
We're the police.

459
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:41,816
Sir, are you okay?

460
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:43,793
He's trying to kill me.

461
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:45,488
What do you want?

462
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,320
Are you always this good
with the patients?

463
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:49,662
Help me,
don't Iet him
take me away.

464
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:52,168
Don't you worry,
nobody's taking
anybody anywhere.

465
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:54,898
Oh, please,
don't encourage him.
This happens every day.

466
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,839
Mr. Leonard hates needles.
But he is going to chemo.

467
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:00,571
We need to talk.
In private.

468
00:24:00,645 --> 00:24:02,613
Look, I've got three patients
Iate for appointments

469
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,705
and I've had nothing
but troublemakers all day.

470
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:05,840
Troublemakers?

471
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,681
How about Bess Sherman?
She one of your troublemakers?

472
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:10,414
HAL: No, she's a dream.

473
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:15,654
We heard
you ran into her
on the outside.

474
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:20,356
With the end
of a cigarette butt.
Maybe that rings a bell.

475
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:23,760
I don't know
what you guys
have been smoking,

476
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:25,928
but I've got
Iives to save.

477
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,276
Jubilee Towers adheres
to the highest standards
of safety.

478
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:42,183
Even we
non-medical employees
are trained in CPR.

479
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:45,347
Well, have the safety
standards been slipping since
Hal started working here?

480
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:46,617
Are all of those
complaints?

481
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,056
You have to understand

482
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:52,186
that many patients
will complain if you just
Iook at them wrong.

483
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:53,321
Hal's worked here
a year.

484
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:55,797
He's only had
one serious complaint
against him.

485
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:57,027
Which was what?

486
00:24:57,101 --> 00:25:00,901
Well, Mr. Jackson
accused Hal of trying
to suffocate him.

487
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,397
Well, did you
call the police?

488
00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:05,635
Uh...
Mr. Jackson is senile.

489
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,410
Well, did you
at Ieast check on it?

490
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:10,879
Of course I did,
but we found nothing.

491
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:12,313
You have to realize

492
00:25:12,383 --> 00:25:16,444
that fiction and reality
blend in the mind
of some of our patients.

493
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:20,321
You know, we get rape reports
after the enema cart
makes its rounds.

494
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:25,090
Hal didn't strike me
as a real people person. Now,
why hire someone Iike that?

495
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:27,062
It's a very Iow-paying job.

496
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:30,498
Not a Iot of people find
changing adult diapers
rewarding.

497
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:32,331
What else
is in the file?

498
00:25:32,403 --> 00:25:35,429
Just incident reports,
on-duty injuries...

499
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:36,597
Whoa, whoa.

500
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:38,073
Hal injured
patients?

501
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:40,440
No, patients
injured him.

502
00:25:43,414 --> 00:25:44,574
Mr. Jackson?

503
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:45,809
Yeah?

504
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:48,745
You the nude models
I ordered?

505
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:51,583
No. Actually we're...
That was a joke.

506
00:25:51,656 --> 00:25:53,385
What can I do you for?

507
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:54,755
Heard you had
problems with Hal,
the nurse's aide.

508
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:56,760
That man's
a serial killer.

509
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:58,489
Tell us about it.

510
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:02,796
He pinches me all the time.
One day I bit him, real hard.

511
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:05,098
Son of a bitch
cut off my oxygen,

512
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,764
whispered,
"You're gonna die soon,
old man."

513
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,101
And nobody
did anything
about it?

514
00:26:09,174 --> 00:26:11,870
MR. JACKSON: Hell, no.
Took his word over mine.

515
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:15,004
Well, we believe you.
He done anything
since then?

516
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,207
Sheet people scared him off.

517
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:21,609
Who?
You know who I mean.

518
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:26,249
KIan comes at night,
roams the halls.
Better watch your back.

519
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:34,056
Okay. We had Mr. Jackson
till he took a Ieft
at Mississippi.

520
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:37,124
Yeah, but even paranoids
are right sometimes.

521
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,931
Oh, we know Hal.
A Iittle short
on the bedside manner.

522
00:26:43,475 --> 00:26:45,500
STABLER: Okay. Well, we heard
you scratched his face.

523
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:47,272
Why?
I can't say for sure.

524
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:49,337
Oh, you know,
just tell them.

525
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:51,541
It was after
I broke my hip
Iast fall.

526
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:54,279
Yeah, taking
dancing Iessons
for that cruise.

527
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:57,322
Anyway,
when I came back
after surgery,

528
00:26:57,389 --> 00:27:01,291
I woke up one night,
convinced that someone
was suffocating me.

529
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,418
Was it Hal?

530
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:04,485
Well, it sure
wasn't the morphine.

531
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:09,398
AII I know is that I thought
I was dying. I started
clawing at something.

532
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:11,333
Then, suddenly,
I could breathe again.

533
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:13,200
When I opened my eyes,

534
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:17,264
Hal was standing over me,
his face scratched
and bleeding.

535
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:18,400
What'd he say?

536
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:20,570
That I was hallucinating.

537
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,975
He pinches the patients,
hides their dentures,

538
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,314
and when he wants a real rush,
he plays keep-away
with their oxygen.

539
00:27:27,386 --> 00:27:30,719
But here's the rub.
Every victim was either
doped up or senile.

540
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,279
Making them
the perfect victims.

541
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:35,349
Even if they remember
what happened, they're still
unreliable witnesses.

542
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:37,361
That's probably why
he took the job
in the first place.

543
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:39,420
He gets his rocks off
watching them suffer.

544
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:40,726
What do you got?

545
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,166
A notice of claim
filed six months ago
against Jubilee Towers.

546
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:45,533
A $10 million
negligence suit

547
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,936
brought about by the estate
of a deceased former resident.

548
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:49,132
What happened?

549
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:52,438
Doesn't say.
A settlement was reached
with a nondisclosure clause.

550
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:54,138
Who was named in the suit?

551
00:27:54,212 --> 00:27:56,442
Everyone the dead woman
came into contact with,

552
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,983
from the director
down to the Iowliest
of nurse's aides.

553
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:00,678
Including our pal Hal?

554
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:02,413
This dead woman
have a name?

555
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:04,011
Dahlia Brown.

556
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,990
I'm already working
on an exhumation order.

557
00:28:09,928 --> 00:28:12,158
Not bad for nine months
in the ground.

558
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,891
Skin's perfectly intact.

559
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:16,456
She's Iost some muscle tone,
but haven't we all?

560
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:19,231
You know the day's coming
when embalming fluid
is put in a Iotion.

561
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:23,934
WARNER: Until then that time,
it will remain the medical
examiner's worst nightmare.

562
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:28,036
When the undertaker
flushed out her blood, he
also flushed away any toxins.

563
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:31,879
The embalming fluid then
dissolved any protein-based
poison in her organs.

564
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,508
Anything you
could test for?

565
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:35,815
Tissue toxicology,
heavy metals,

566
00:28:35,887 --> 00:28:39,345
which came back negative
for arsenic, Iead and cyanide.

567
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:41,949
The death certificate
said cardiac arrest.

568
00:28:42,027 --> 00:28:43,892
Which means
we don't know
what really happened,

569
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:45,759
but we don't think
it was foul play.

570
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:48,299
The M.E.'s gotta put
something down
for cause of death.

571
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:49,890
What would you have put?

572
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:53,597
I don't know,
but I certainly
would have mentioned this.

573
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:58,943
A tiny pinprick hole
unaccounted for
in the medical records.

574
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,706
She was in the hospital wing.
Maybe they gave her an IV.

575
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,114
She was in to have
her knee drained.
The hole's in the wrong place.

576
00:29:06,184 --> 00:29:08,709
You settled with
the deceased's daughter.

577
00:29:08,787 --> 00:29:10,277
Realize you made
a mistake?

578
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:13,153
No, it was cheaper
than going to court.

579
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:15,382
Well, then
what happened with Dahlia?

580
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,519
Well, grieving people
sometimes have trouble

581
00:29:17,596 --> 00:29:19,894
accepting the death
of Ioved ones.

582
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:23,025
The pain makes them Iook
for someone to blame.

583
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, speaking of which,
I noticed in Dahlia's records

584
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:30,405
that her Iast supper
was delivered by somebody
with the initials H.S.

585
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:35,402
STABLER: Any other nurses'
aides with those initials
besides Hal Shipley?

586
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:38,980
We're gonna need to speak
with anybody

587
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,110
who might have seen him
with Dahlia that night.

588
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:44,320
Okay.

589
00:29:45,557 --> 00:29:46,854
Man, I don't want
to grow old.

590
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:49,393
In our Iine of work,
be careful what you
wish for. How'd you do?

591
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:51,258
No one remembers
any fireworks
between them,

592
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:53,388
but I did find out
a Iittle about Dahlia.

593
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:54,489
Great Iady,
Iousy patient?

594
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:56,329
When she was in pain,
she was a pain.

595
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,164
Needy and demanding,
Hal's favorite.

596
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:59,931
Yeah, he had means,
he had opportunity

597
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:02,838
with Bess, Dahlia,
Mr. Jackson, a dozen others.

598
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:05,399
That we know of.
He's Iike a psycho kid
in a candy store.

599
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:06,910
Time to take away
his candy.

600
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:08,912
Excuse me, where...
Room 410's coding.

601
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,208
Quick,
get the crash cart.

602
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:12,011
410 is Bess' room.

603
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,744
ANNOUNCER: Code blue
to room 410.
Code blue to room 410.

604
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,753
WOMAN: Hurry! In here!

605
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:17,247
Hope.

606
00:30:18,156 --> 00:30:21,421
You were right.
I saw it was him.
He was...

607
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:24,462
Let's calm down.
Just take a breath
and tell us what happened.

608
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,224
After we talked,
I called Hal in

609
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:29,927
and, you know,
I told him to finish
his shift and Ieave.

610
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:31,434
He wanted to know why,
and I told him.

611
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:33,528
I said, "It's because
of the way
you treat the patients."

612
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:35,300
And he was furious
and he just stormed out.

613
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:37,568
You can't help in there.
Now, did he make
any threats?

614
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:39,701
No, but after
what we talked about,
you know...

615
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:43,942
I was worried, so I came down
to check on Bess,
and that's when I saw him.

616
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:45,607
What was he doing?
He was just...

617
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:48,244
He was Ieaving the room,
but I didn't even think.

618
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,347
I just went in there
and her pulse was weak
and thready

619
00:30:52,424 --> 00:30:53,359
and I just pushed
the code button
and started CPR.

620
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,552
Hold on, hold on.

621
00:30:54,628 --> 00:30:57,290
Bess?
NURSE: Move her
to the full-care wing.

622
00:30:58,131 --> 00:30:59,257
I'm gonna go with her.

623
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,961
NURSE: Put her on a monitor
and start an IV.

624
00:31:03,103 --> 00:31:05,230
She had a fresh
needle mark.

625
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:14,641
What are you still
doing here?
We heard you were fired.

626
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:17,980
The pencil-pushing
bootlicker told me
to finish off my shift.

627
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:21,384
Account for
your whereabouts
for the Iast 15 minutes.

628
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,855
Stockroom.
Taking inventory.

629
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,392
Let's go for a ride, Hal.
Am I under arrest?

630
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,519
No.
Then screw off.

631
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:31,628
Excuse me?

632
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,268
Whatever. Let's party.

633
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:50,912
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

634
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:52,508
Yeah, a big
tearful goodbye.

635
00:31:52,586 --> 00:31:54,383
Oh, you really don't
wanna miss this.

636
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,183
STABLER: You got
a Iatent print report?

637
00:31:56,256 --> 00:31:58,451
Hal's known,
identified print.

638
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:01,585
From that Iast cig break
at the Towers.
You really shouldn't Iitter.

639
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:02,993
You can't do that.

640
00:32:03,063 --> 00:32:04,997
Yeah, well, you
voluntarily discarded it.

641
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:07,090
Meaning Iegally,
your butt is ours.

642
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:10,295
As is this one,
retrieved from Joe Sherman's
party trash.

643
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,565
Well, that Iooks
Iike a match.
Seven-point.

644
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,301
We've got a bifurcation,
three ending ridges
and an island.

645
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,434
Lots of guys
were smoking
at the party.

646
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:20,912
Yeah? Well, how many
had seared flesh at the end
of their cancer sticks?

647
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,642
That we can match
to Bess Sherman.

648
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:24,377
Uh... Where's the Iab
on the DNA?

649
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:25,941
I'm on my way there
right now.

650
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,509
Call us when you know.
When we have the results,

651
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:29,521
we won't need a confession
from pantywaist here.

652
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,648
No confession,
no plea bargain.

653
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:33,716
Which means
you do the max.

654
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:37,962
CSU said they couldn't
get flesh off
of the cigarette.

655
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:39,724
Oops.

656
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,235
Okay, I burned her.

657
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:45,532
What?

658
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:47,998
I burned her.
Why?

659
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:51,435
It's not Iike
I planned it.

660
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,674
Andy owed me a Iot of money,
which he said he could get
from Grandma Bess.

661
00:32:54,748 --> 00:32:56,340
Owed you money
for what?

662
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,577
Nothing to do
with this.

663
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,784
He pulls a check
from her purse, says,
"You need to sign this, Gran."

664
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,016
Bam, she does.

665
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:06,321
So it's so easy,
you think you're gonna
try it yourself.

666
00:33:06,393 --> 00:33:08,827
So you go back in,
get another check.

667
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:10,157
And she yells, "Rape."

668
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,791
Just Iike she used to
at the home when
I'd help dress her. As if.

669
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,028
Your job sucked, we know.
No, you don't know!

670
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:19,129
I had to clean them
and feed them
and wipe up their crap.

671
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,639
STABLER: They owed you.

672
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,437
So all she had to do
was sign the other check.

673
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,776
But what does she do?
She screams? She tried
to get you in trouble.

674
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:33,119
So I go over
to quiet her down,

675
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:35,381
and my cigarette
accidentally burns her chest.

676
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:38,151
And she starts screaming rape
at the top of her Iungs,

677
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,591
and I just...
I just snap.

678
00:33:41,461 --> 00:33:44,089
I say,
"I'II show you rape."

679
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:47,099
And I pull up her nightgown

680
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:50,898
and I jab that cigarette
at her again and again
and again.

681
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:56,868
What happened
when you saw her today?

682
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:58,470
I didn't see her today.

683
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:02,072
Sweetie, we've got a witness
who saw you Ieaving her room.

684
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:04,515
Then they were hallucinating.

685
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,076
When she coded,
I was in the stockroom.
I can prove it.

686
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:15,722
Hal's been hacking into
the drug computer. Son of
a bitch was stealing drugs.

687
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:17,960
Maybe he fudged
the times.

688
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:22,400
According to the tech, this
machine is Iike the Fort Knox
of drug dispensers.

689
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,494
Then he's covered.
His Iist of stolen
nurses' codes

690
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:27,369
matches perfectly
to what we found
in his Iocker.

691
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,602
Well, Hope swore
she saw him Ieaving
Bess' room.

692
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:32,543
So, if the computer's
not Iying...

693
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,638
Bess isn't the first patient
Hope has saved, you know.

694
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:36,739
Really?

695
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:40,275
She found Mrs. Mercer
in cardiac arrest
Iast Christmas Eve.

696
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:42,378
Same situation?
She started CPR?

697
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:44,447
Can you imagine
a more depressing day
to die?

698
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:45,786
Sounds Iike
a Christmas miracle.

699
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:47,588
I think there was
one other time.

700
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:49,288
Zona?
ZONA: Yeah?

701
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:51,694
Didn't Hope Garrett
save another patient before?

702
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:53,494
Oh. She tried.
The guy didn't make it.

703
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,693
No, this was a woman.

704
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:56,702
Remember, uh, senior prom?

705
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,930
Oh, yeah.

706
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:00,905
Senior prom
with the emphasis
on "senior"?

707
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,499
It's a dance
the Level One-ers throw
every spring.

708
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:05,272
Their anti-youth
counterstatement.

709
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:09,475
You know, the punch always
gets spiked, somebody tries
to Iimbo and breaks a hip.

710
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:13,508
So this woman that Hope saved
was otherwise
a healthy dance casualty.

711
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:17,387
Well, she wasn't dancing.
She collapsed
at the buffet table.

712
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:20,190
It's a good thing
Hope knows her CPR.

713
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:24,160
I'm not gonna Iet
anybody else hurt you, Ma.
You're coming home with me.

714
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:26,290
You sure that's
in her best interest?

715
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:27,856
Oh, I don't know,
maybe I'II throw her
back in

716
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,993
with that Iunatic
who burned her,
Iike you did.

717
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,332
Dad, you're upsetting Gran.

718
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:32,837
JOE: No Iip from you.

719
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:34,203
You're the one that started

720
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:37,368
this whole thing by Ietting
that drug supplier
into my house.

721
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:38,775
I'II come by Iater, Gran.

722
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,608
I'II bring those brochures
of the other homes.

723
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,671
Sweet boy.

724
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:45,479
Just so you know,
Hal's in custody. He won't be
hurting anybody else.

725
00:35:45,552 --> 00:35:46,985
Oh, you're so quick.

726
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:49,851
It only took two attempts
on my mother's Iife
for you to figure it out.

727
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:49,117
You're my friend,
aren't you?

728
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,488
Yes, I am, Bess.

729
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:51,992
Make this man be quiet.

730
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,891
Don't you worry about it.
He's just Ieaving.

731
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:55,361
JOE: Guess again.

732
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,092
I was wrongly accused.
The protective order
was dropped.

733
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,397
Well, I hear that
the misappropriation
of funds investigation

734
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:02,300
is just beginning.

735
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,532
Uh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

736
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:06,733
No, you're welcome
anytime.

737
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:08,875
And thanks for
saving my mother's Iife.

738
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:11,606
Oh, well, Bess
is one of
our favorites.

739
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:15,182
No way
she's going anywhere
while I'm around.

740
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:20,378
So, you have saved,
what, three now?

741
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:23,316
Including Bess,
yeah, I guess so.

742
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:24,951
And just that
one Ioss.

743
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:26,289
Mr. Tazelo.

744
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:28,124
Yeah, what happened?

745
00:36:28,764 --> 00:36:33,701
I was passing by X-ray and
there he was, just slumped
over in his wheelchair.

746
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:37,795
So, he'd been Ieft
unattended?

747
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:40,341
I'm sure an aide
was on the way.

748
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,240
But he was alone
Iong enough
to die unnoticed.

749
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:44,142
Or was he still breathing
when you found him?

750
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:46,841
He was. I mean,
you know, he was dead.

751
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:49,283
But you still tried
to resuscitate him.

752
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:51,683
Well, I didn't know
how Iong
he'd been there.

753
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:54,916
We bring people back
all the time. So, I just, um,

754
00:36:56,191 --> 00:37:00,924
you know, pulled him
to the floor and started CPR.
I didn't want to give up.

755
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:03,965
They had to pull me off.

756
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:08,969
This woman
is a complete wacko.

757
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:11,267
It could be
malignant hero syndrome.

758
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,706
A person
sets up a risky situation
to create an emergency

759
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,140
and then comes out a hero.

760
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,609
Like a fireman
starting a fire.

761
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:20,011
It's all about personal gain.
In this case, attention,
prestige.

762
00:37:20,082 --> 00:37:21,515
Like Munchausen by proxy.

763
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:25,075
She kills people
just to bring them back
to feel better about herself.

764
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:26,848
What was she
shooting them up with?

765
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:30,449
I picked up
Bess' tox screen report
from the hospital wing.

766
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:33,255
There's no poisons,
no anomalous drugs.

767
00:37:33,996 --> 00:37:36,430
She had epinephrine
in her system.

768
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,694
That's what they give
when your heart stops,
right?

769
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:39,791
Exactly.

770
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:42,359
I guess that's why it's under
the "no big surprise" column.

771
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:44,200
Well, Hope revived Bess
with CPR.

772
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:48,004
Once her heart was started
again, she shouldn't have been
given epinephrine.

773
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:51,341
And according to
this chart, she wasn't.

774
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:54,439
What would happen
if that was given to somebody
who had a healthy heart?

775
00:37:54,516 --> 00:37:56,211
It would speed up
heart rate,

776
00:37:56,285 --> 00:38:00,187
increasing cardiac output
and blood pressure
to a dangerous Ievel.

777
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:01,745
Mimicking a heart attack.

778
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,552
Perfect crime.

779
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:06,553
Son of a bitch.
Hope was a nurse.

780
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:09,720
She worked at
Oak GIade Nursing Home.

781
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:13,063
Her Iicense
was revoked
15 years ago.

782
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:14,727
FIN: On what grounds?

783
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:17,264
Gross negligence.

784
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,303
"Failed to dilute
potassium chloride doses."

785
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:28,848
It's cozy, isn't it?
An elevator adjacent. Do you
Iike to swim, Mr. Hamrick?

786
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:31,852
Because you're gonna Iove
the water aerobics class.

787
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,512
I hear that really gets
your heart rate up.

788
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:36,148
It's a hell of a Iot safer
than being injected
with epinephrine.

789
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,657
Is everything
all right?

790
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:40,217
Absolutely.
Excuse me one minute.

791
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:42,661
EIIiot, OIivia. Um...

792
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:46,334
This probably isn't
a good time to talk
about the unpleasantness.

793
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:48,062
Oh, we don't plan
to discuss it here.

794
00:38:48,136 --> 00:38:49,330
Good.

795
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:52,396
A squad room would be
much more appropriate.

796
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:55,072
Did something new
happen with Hal?

797
00:38:55,143 --> 00:38:59,102
Well, our techs
pulled the used syringes
on the Sharps boxes here.

798
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:01,308
Hal's prints
weren't on
any of them.

799
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:03,715
Well, he had access to,

800
00:39:03,785 --> 00:39:07,312
you know,
over a dozen boxes
of surgical gloves,

801
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,118
so maybe
he thought
to use a pair.

802
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:10,658
STABLER: You didn't.

803
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:15,493
They found your prints
on a syringe of epi in the box
at the nurses' station.

804
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:18,198
Well, you know Hal did it.
He confessed.

805
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:19,961
BENSON: To burning her.

806
00:39:20,035 --> 00:39:24,768
But you didn't give a damn
about that as Iong as
you could grab the spotlight.

807
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:31,169
Why are you trying
to embarrass me?
People can hear you.

808
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:33,544
Drama queen, you enjoy
being the center of attention.

809
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:36,311
Hope Garrett, you're
under arrest for the attempted
murder of Bess Sherman...

810
00:39:36,385 --> 00:39:37,409
What are you talking about?

811
00:39:37,486 --> 00:39:39,784
...and suspicion of murders
committed at
Oak GIade Nursing Home.

812
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,085
This is ridiculous, okay?
You have the right
to remain silent.

813
00:39:42,157 --> 00:39:43,522
This is absolutely ridiculous.
It's a mistake.

814
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:46,152
If you give up that right,
anything you say...
This is a mistake!

815
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:51,630
I examined the records
of 22 deaths at Oak GIade

816
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,329
between May of 1982
and March of 1987.

817
00:39:55,404 --> 00:39:57,269
And what did you find?

818
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:00,536
Evidence of
potassium poisoning
in seven of them.

819
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:03,537
Why wasn't this discovered
in any of their autopsies?

820
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:05,546
WARNER: People expect
the elderly to die.

821
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:09,277
An autopsy is performed
maybe one out of 25 cases.

822
00:40:09,351 --> 00:40:11,251
CABOT: Well, surely
some of them were examined?

823
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:14,345
Yes, but when cells die,
they release potassium.

824
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:16,288
It would have been
impossible to detect.

825
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:17,620
So, how did you?

826
00:40:17,692 --> 00:40:19,683
By examining
their EKGs.

827
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:22,389
Could you please
show us on the board?

828
00:40:23,565 --> 00:40:28,468
AII showed tachycardia
and a widened QRS,
indicative of hyperkalemia.

829
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:30,300
CABOT: Uh...
In Iayman's terms?

830
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:32,840
WARNER: Their hearts
were beating too fast.

831
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:36,271
Dr. Warner, what causes there
to be too much potassium
in the blood?

832
00:40:36,344 --> 00:40:40,246
Kidney failure can,
or it was introduced
by an outside source.

833
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:42,483
Did any of them
have kidney disease?

834
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:45,816
No. Someone administered
Iethal doses.

835
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:48,583
Do you have any idea
how many mistakes
doctors make,

836
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,249
how many times
I've covered their asses?

837
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:51,587
Counselor,
you control your client,

838
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,093
or I'II have her removed
from this courtroom.

839
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:54,150
Yes, Your Honor.

840
00:40:54,229 --> 00:40:57,027
JUDGE: The jury will disregard
the defendant's outburst.

841
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:58,998
The People may proceed.

842
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:01,101
One Iast question, Dr. Warner.

843
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:04,764
In all these cases, how many
different administering nurses
were there?

844
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,740
Just one.
Hope Garrett.

845
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:08,708
Yes, but you
have to understand

846
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:10,870
every Iast one of them
was at death's door.
JUDGE: Counselor.

847
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:13,107
Your Honor, I'm sorry.
This won't happen again.

848
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:16,082
You know, I don't think
you realize how Iittle time
that they had Ieft.

849
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:17,982
I don't care if they were
on their very Iast breath.

850
00:41:18,053 --> 00:41:19,418
You had no right
to take it from them.

851
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:22,548
You don't understand.
I help people.
What do you do?

852
00:41:22,624 --> 00:41:24,421
You stupid bitch!
Hope!

853
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:27,087
This is not helping.
Court is recessed.
Bailiff, take the jury out.

854
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:29,687
How can you just sit there
and Iet them crucify me?

855
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:31,925
I don't need this, you know.
I'm Ieaving.

856
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,591
JUDGE: Court officers,
remove the defendant.

857
00:41:33,668 --> 00:41:38,537
This is not fair. AII you
tell them about is
Oak GIade and Jubilee Towers.

858
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:41,474
But I've worked in homes
for 15 years in between.

859
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:42,840
And how many of them
did you kill?

860
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:44,902
I didn't kill anybody.

861
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,005
Maybe a few of them
wouldn't pull through for me,

862
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:49,482
but I have saved hundreds.
Hundreds.

863
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:52,679
And you don't even care
about them, do you?

864
00:41:52,754 --> 00:41:54,813
Take your hands off of me!

865
00:41:55,423 --> 00:41:56,890
Let go of me!
