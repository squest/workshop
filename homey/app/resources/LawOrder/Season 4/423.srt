a sample so you can frame
me with my own cells.

154
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:54,969
Why would we do that?

155
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:59,173
I don't know.
Why would you stick a plunger
up Abner Louima's ass?

156
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,877
If you want anything from me,
come back with a warrant.

157
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:05,146
I believe
that's check and mate.

158
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,121
Sure is, smartass.

159
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:15,660
STABLER: Couldn't get a DNA
sample from our suspect,
but I think we got prints.

160
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,126
Index finger
and thumb.

161
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,224
I'II see if I can Iift
a print off the body.

162
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:22,292
Meanwhile, I've got
Iots to work with.

163
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,167
There's evidence
of vaginal trauma,

164
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:26,935
I've got the perp's fluids,
and I got skin cells,

165
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,566
from underneath
her acrylic nails.

166
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,133
Great for trapping evidence.

167
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:31,974
Could explain
the Band-Aid
on Donovan's neck.

168
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,741
Vanessa clawed
the son of a bitch.

169
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:35,180
She wasn't
the only one.

170
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,445
The blood on the cat's fur
was Vanessa's,

171
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,249
but the blood on its claws,
was a match to the perp.

172
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,016
We gotta get
Donovan's DNA.

173
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,024
I'II get the prints off
the chess piece and send them

174
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,219
over to Ballistics
to compare with the gun.

175
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,655
I dusted the gun.
The wooden grip is too
textured to raise prints,

176
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:52,700
and only your victim's
are on the barrel.

177
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,234
Like Vanessa
tried to grab it.

178
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:56,998
AIso found a greasy
substance on the weapon.

179
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:58,095
Gun cleaning fluid?

180
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,106
No, I'd recognize
that in my sleep.

181
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:01,641
I'II run some
tests on it.

182
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,801
So that's it?

183
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,538
Would I waste your time?

184
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,273
I've got the gun owner.

185
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,611
You mean we have a Iegal,
registered piece?

186
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:12,744
Mmm-hmm. Carry permit comes
back to Marvin KIigman,
address on Park Avenue.

187
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:16,247
Sure, Marvin had a gun.

188
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:20,055
My Iate husband,
may he rest in peace,
was in the diamond trade.

189
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:21,926
Dangerous business.

190
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,759
MUNCH: Where's the gun now,
Mrs. KIigman?

191
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:24,991
In my Iock box.

192
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,328
May we see it?

193
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,063
Of course.

194
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,298
Does anyone else
have access to the gun?

195
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:35,308
Only my son.
He Iives in the dorms.
At Hudson University.

196
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,284
It's gone.

197
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,321
I didn't take
my father's gun.

198
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,551
How did it get used
to kill your classmate?

199
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,890
I don't know anything
about Vanessa's murder.

200
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:55,793
But you do know her.
Yeah.

201
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,262
Yeah? You sleeping with her?

202
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:58,424
Yeah, I wish.

203
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,989
BENSON: Where were you
Iast night?

204
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:03,697
At an all-night cram session
with my study group.
Go check.

205
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,969
Oh, we will, but right now
you're the one who's Iooking
good for this murder.

206
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,470
Okay.

207
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,540
I got a Iittle over-extended
on the Super Bowl.

208
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:16,015
I was gonna sell the gun,
but someone stole it.

209
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:17,608
You know Donovan AIvarez?

210
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:18,777
Yeah, sure,
he Iives down my hall.

211
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:19,842
Could he
have stolen it?

212
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:20,943
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

213
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:22,250
I don't know...

214
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:23,585
Stabler.

215
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,182
Did Donovan ever
see the gun?

216
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,523
Yeah, I was Iooking
for a buyer.

217
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:29,529
I showed it to a Iot
of people, including Donovan.

218
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:31,394
Did he see
where you kept it?

219
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,058
Yeah, yeah,
in my desk.

220
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,694
Warner. She wants
to talk to us.

221
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:40,567
You fumed her.

222
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:42,667
It's amazing
what you can do
with crazy glue.

223
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:46,009
Vaporize it,
and when it hardens,
you can dust a print on skin.

224
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,172
Where's the print?

225
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:49,842
On the inside of her
right wrist, where
there's deep bruising.

226
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,441
STABLER: Like someone
grabbed her hard.

227
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,043
With the glue,
it's as clear as day.

228
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:54,418
Donovan AIvarez?

229
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:56,013
Ten point match.

230
00:10:57,225 --> 00:11:00,490
PROFESSOR:
In People v. Carmichael,
the M.E. ruled that the death

231
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,496
was due to undetermined
homicidal violence.

232
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,126
How did the District Attorney
get a conviction?

233
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:10,136
Donovan AIvarez, you're under
arrest for the murder
of Vanessa Bevins.

234
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:11,296
PROFESSOR: Hey, what do
you think you're doing?

235
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:12,464
You can't do this.
Sure we can.

236
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,529
What do you think
you're doing?

237
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,542
Your teacher
cover Miranda yet?
What's going on? Hey!

238
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,508
You have the right
to remain silent.

239
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:19,045
If you give up that right,
anything you say
can and will be used...

240
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,147
This is your Iast chance,
Donovan.

241
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,617
Just tell us the truth.

242
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,520
Once there's a DNA match,
no one will care
what you say.

243
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:30,216
I am telling the truth,
all right.

244
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,226
I didn't kill Vanessa.
I only went to the club
to talk to her.

245
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:34,818
Because you were pissed off
that she broke up with you?

246
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:36,989
No, I was pissed because
she stole my credit card

247
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:39,533
and spent thousands
of dollars on crazy stuff.

248
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,228
That sounds Iike a good
motive to drag her out
to the alley and kill her.

249
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:43,463
No.

250
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:47,270
We were arguing because
Vanessa said she had bigger
problems than paying me back.

251
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:48,899
So then you pulled
the gun to make her
take you seriously.

252
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,136
No, I didn't have a gun.

253
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,872
Come on, Donovan.

254
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,574
Vanessa was killed with a gun
stolen from your dorm.

255
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,879
I don't know
anything about that.

256
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,511
Why don't you believe me?
I could never hurt Vanessa.

257
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:02,613
You grabbed her so hard
your prints were
bruised into her flesh.

258
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,250
She was walking away.
I grabbed her arm
so I could stop her.

259
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,226
Is that when
she scratched your neck?

260
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,853
I cut myself shaving.

261
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:11,526
See for yourself.

262
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,226
Does this Iook
Iike a scratch?

263
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:18,696
BENSON: You believe his story?
I don't know.

264
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:20,400
Vanessa's on drugs,
desperate for money,

265
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,534
she steals from
her ex-boyfriend.
Sounds Iike motive to me.

266
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,273
Donovan can't explain how
Vanessa was shot with a gun
that he had access to?

267
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:31,717
Something wrong?

268
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,147
Yeah. Ray Bevins,
he called five times.

269
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,020
CRAGEN: DNA's back.

270
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,117
The semen, fingernail
scrapings, and the blood
on the cat's claw,

271
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,923
all come from
the same person.

272
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:44,055
And it's not
Donovan AIvarez.

273
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,197
So, Vanessa had
sex with someone else
earlier that night,

274
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,100
and then Donovan
shoots her in the alley.

275
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:53,868
Possible, but not enough to
hold a kid you arrested in
front of a criminal Iaw class.

276
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,067
BENSON: We can't
cut him Ioose.

277
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:56,770
And we can't
talk to him anymore.

278
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,004
BENSON: Why's that?

279
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,309
Professor called and
Iawyered up for him.

280
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,473
Ray.

281
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:02,607
Detective.

282
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,173
It's the middle of the night.
What are you doing here?

283
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:05,446
I called.

284
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,954
I know. I haven't had a chance
to get back to you. I'm sorry.

285
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:10,388
I just wanted to know
if you had any Ieads.

286
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,449
Yeah, we're making progress.

287
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,888
Can't you tell
me anything?

288
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,489
No. Ray, go home.
Get some sleep.

289
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,556
I can't.

290
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,533
I can't...
I mean,
I can't sleep.

291
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:26,072
I just keep seeing
Vanessa's face,
in the morgue.

292
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,471
Ray...

293
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,272
If I have any news,
I'II call you.
I promise. You have my word.

294
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:33,973
Now go home.
Go home.

295
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:40,615
Hey, how's he doing?

296
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,121
He's a mess.

297
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,225
The Iogs on Vanessa's phone.
Check out this number.

298
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:47,622
Dozens of calls to it.

299
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,128
It's the Rape
Crisis Center.

300
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,023
Why was Vanessa
calling them two weeks
before she was raped?

301
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:58,400
Vanessa must've called me
20 times, but she never
gave a Iast name.

302
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,633
I was afraid if I pushed
too hard, she'd stop calling.

303
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,505
I know what she said
is confidential...

304
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:06,673
And any father would
waive confidentiality
to catch his child's killer.

305
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:08,273
Let's cut
the red tape.

306
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,283
Good. Why was Vanessa
calling you?

307
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:13,718
She was in
a sexual relationship
she couldn't handle.

308
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:15,050
So, she was raped.

309
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:16,783
She wasn't sure.

310
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:20,988
She needed help understanding
what had happened to her,
but it was rape all right.

311
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,292
She had gotten involved
with this man that she met.

312
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,991
Donovan AIvarez?

313
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,159
She never gave his name.

314
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:30,170
He was a sadist.
He Iiked to degrade her.

315
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:33,173
Make her have sex
in public places.
Get rough.

316
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,505
When she refused,
he beat her up.

317
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:38,204
After that she was too
scared to say no again.

318
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,008
Why didn't she
call the police?

319
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:41,673
I gave her your number.

320
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:45,149
Vanessa just wasn't ready.
She was very depressed.

321
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,516
She kept blaming herself
instead of her boss.

322
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,382
Her boss?

323
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:54,917
Yeah, that's
who was raping her.

324
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:00,461
Look, I understand
the need for investigation.

325
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,502
I just don't see
how I can help you.

326
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,629
Well, you were at the club,
weren't you?

327
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:08,573
I was in the VIP room.
I told that to the officers
who interviewed me.

328
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:10,611
You didn't tell them
you were sleeping
with the victim.

329
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:13,338
(SIGHS)

330
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:17,974
Well, now I see.
Someone's been talking
about me behind my back.

331
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:21,419
Then Iet's talk openly,
in our squad room.

332
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,724
Baby, I'm going now.
You'II call me Iater?

333
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:27,683
Come here.

334
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,157
You know I will.

335
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,665
Give me a moment to call
my Iawyer. I'II have him
meet me there.

336
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,798
There's no need to.
You're not under arrest.

337
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:43,467
And I'd Iike to
keep it that way.

338
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:48,746
My client is more than
happy to assist in
the investigation.

339
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:49,976
He'II answer
your questions.

340
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,450
Why don't we Iet
his DNA sample
do the talking?

341
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,647
Oh, hey, take a swab.
It'II match.

342
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:57,983
I'm sure
you'II find my blood
in the alleyway, too.

343
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,391
Damn cat clawed
the hell out of my ass.

344
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:02,328
Listen, I had sex
with Vanessa that night.
That's not a crime.

345
00:16:02,397 --> 00:16:03,694
Rape and sodomy are.

346
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,565
(SCOFFS)

347
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:10,936
Rape? Detective,
I don't need to force
women to have sex with me.

348
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:13,839
Oh, so you expect
us to believe

349
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,604
that Vanessa Iiked
being half-naked,

350
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:18,111
down on her knees
in a dirty alley?

351
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,738
Yeah, she grew to Iike it.

352
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,680
Once you stripped away
that schoolgirl exterior,

353
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,117
underneath Iay
a very adventurous woman.

354
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:29,315
Why'd you go out back?

355
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,052
I don't Iike to
share my girls.

356
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:32,860
I saw Vanessa go
outside with a friend.

357
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:34,919
I went to make sure
they weren't
having a quickie.

358
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:36,123
Were they?

359
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:38,063
No, no. Her tastes
had changed.

360
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,930
She told him to
get the hell out.

361
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:41,230
BENSON: So,
did you see him Ieave?

362
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:42,793
He got into a cab.

363
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:46,307
Vanessa and I had
a Iittle fun,
and then I went back inside.

364
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,503
So she fought
with her boyfriend,
had sex with you,

365
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:52,604
and then, a third guy
came along and he killed her.

366
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:53,978
Is that what
you're telling me?

367
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:59,347
Truth is stranger
than fiction.

368
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:03,422
But you're the only one
with a history
of abusing Vanessa.

369
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:04,618
Oh, more gossip?

370
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:06,923
BENSON: No, we have witnesses.

371
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:11,197
Vanessa told people
about your repeated
sexual assault.

372
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,894
I don't recall anyone
watching us having sex.

373
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:17,132
So unless you guys
communicate with ghosts,
you've got nothing.

374
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:19,639
AII right. My client
has answered all
of your questions.

375
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,302
So, unless
you're arresting him,
we're Ieaving.

376
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:23,366
(CLEARS THROAT)

377
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:30,314
You'II notify me
if you want to speak
to my client any further.

378
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,012
Oh, we'II be speaking
to him again, yeah.

379
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,315
Come on.

380
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:36,883
Detective Stabler,
any news about Vanessa?

381
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,017
Are you her father?
Yeah.

382
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,391
Hey, I'm really sorry.

383
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:42,930
Thanks. Who are you?

384
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:46,132
Oh, sorry,
Perry Williams.

385
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,828
How do you know
my daughter?

386
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:49,871
I was her boss.
Let's talk. Come on.

387
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,963
She was really sweet.
What?

388
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:54,602
Why are you here?

389
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:55,973
WILLIAMS: I'm just answering
a few questions.

390
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:57,671
About what?

391
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,338
My relationship
with your daughter.

392
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:01,473
You bastard! You raped
and murdered my daughter.

393
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,074
Hey, hey, I didn't
have to rape her.

394
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,618
And I sure
didn't kill her.

395
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,176
He's not worth it.
Let him go. AII right?

396
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:08,279
AII right, all right.
Come on.

397
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:12,525
Ray, you've gotta
stop coming here.

398
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:13,959
I got nothing
else to do.

399
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,223
What about your job?

400
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:17,492
I don't give a damn
about my work anymore.

401
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,664
You're never going
to make an arrest.

402
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:25,205
It's been three days, Ray.
You gotta give me time.

403
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:28,504
That filth killed my daughter
and you're just gonna Iet him
walk out the door.

404
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:31,205
We don't have enough evidence
to arrest him for murder yet.

405
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,110
You could at Ieast
arrest him for rape.

406
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,979
He's claiming their
relationship was consensual.

407
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:40,316
That's crazy.
We need the proof.

408
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:42,515
What do you think?
It doesn't matter
what I think, Ray.

409
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:44,786
In your heart,
what do you think?

410
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,795
We may never know.

412
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:58,003
Just tell me...

413
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:01,599
Did he rape her?

414
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,773

at him for it.

(SIGHS)

417
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:15,651
We're gonna
get the guy.

418
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,254
Thanks.

419
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:33,035
Go home.

420
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:35,632
You sound Iike
me talking to Ray.

421
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,940
EIIiot, there's nothing
we can do tonight.

422
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:40,106
We'II start fresh
in the morning.

423
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:42,309
I need to get
that bastard.

424
00:19:42,384 --> 00:19:45,012
PIenty of other bastards
out there, EIIiot,
why this one?

425
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:47,488
You know why.

426
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,892
I'm gonna go catch
a few hours of sleep.

427
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:52,959
See you at 7:00.

428
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,430
Hey, it's Stabler.
Sorry to bother you so Iate,

429
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,194
I need you to do
me a big favor.

430
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:01,133
You gotta run
the tests tonight.

431
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,472
I burned a sample
of the greasy residue
in the gas chromatograph.

432
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:07,736
Tell me it nails
Perry Williams.

433
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,300
Hear me out.

434
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:13,109
The grease on the gun
had three component
organic substances.

435
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:15,878
The first two are
Ianolin and talc.

436
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,647
Skin care products?
Exactly.

437
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,779
Chemical compositions
identical to the Iotion

438
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:21,880
and face powder
brands Vanessa used.

439
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,925
So the gun
touched her skin.

440
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:27,019
It doesn't explain the flakes
trapped in the Iotion.

441
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:31,726
Cured tobacco, same brand
as the cigarettes we found
in Vanessa's purse.

442
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:33,234
Vanessa was carrying
the gun.

443
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,066
She tried to defend herself.
Perp took it away
and shot her.

444
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:38,299
You'd think so,

445
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:43,971
but I decided to take
another Iook at the residue
pattern on Vanessa's hands.

446
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:45,070
Here it is.

447
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:48,844
But that residue
pattern is not consistent
with any defensive posture.

448
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:53,014
Not Iike this.
Not Iike this. And so on.

449
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:54,351
So you have no match.

450
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:56,288
I think there
might be.

451
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,826
Like this.

452
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:06,925
Fire in the hole.

453
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,440
It's a match.

454
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,645
Vanessa killed herself.

455
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:31,754
Perry Williams raped Vanessa
and it drove her to suicide.

456
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:35,285
She steals the gun,
brings it down to
the alley to kill him,

457
00:21:35,364 --> 00:21:36,353
Ioses her nerve.

458
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:40,095
When Perry rapes her again,
it's the Iast straw,
so she kills herself.

459
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,934
This bastards gonna escape,
we got nothing on the rape.

460
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:46,441
You know, maybe Vanessa told
someone in person, other than
the rape crisis counselor.

461
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,602
We get an outcry witness,
we got ourselves a chance.

462
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:50,976
Ray didn't know,
none of her friends knew.

463
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:52,912
Hell, no one even
knew she was suicidal.

464
00:21:52,982 --> 00:21:54,779
They all say
she was a party girl.

465
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,910
This may explain why.
Vanessa's toxicology report.

466
00:21:57,987 --> 00:21:59,921
It says that her
blood was positive
for Iithium.

467
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:01,013
What's that used for?

468
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,853
For treating
bi-polar disorder.

469
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:05,291
No wonder she was
flying high one day,
and crashing the next.

470
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:08,888
Promiscuous, going on spending
sprees, explains why everyone
thought she was on drugs.

471
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:10,158
It also explains
her inability

472
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,928
to break off from
Perry Williams despite
his treatment of her.

473
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:14,264
So why didn't
the Iithium help?

474
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:17,465
Because the amount
found in her blood
wasn't a therapeutic dose.

475
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,100
My guess is she stopped
taking her meds a week ago.

476
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,508
So why didn't anybody
tell us about her diagnosis?

477
00:22:22,578 --> 00:22:24,773
This is a woman
who suffered in silence.

478
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:28,645
Now, I gotta tell Ray
his only child killed herself.

479
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,644
First you tell me she's
on drugs. Now you tell me
that she's crazy,

480
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:34,781
and I'm telling you
I know my daughter,
and she was never suicidal.

481
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:36,586
If you'd Iike,
you can talk to
our medical examiner.

482
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,320
She can explain how
she came to the findings.

483
00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:40,089
Thank you.
You know what,
I will.

484
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:45,125
Did you know that she
was taking medication
for bipolar disorder?

485
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:48,227
She was moody.
I mean, she felt
things very intensely.

486
00:22:48,304 --> 00:22:52,400
She was a caring...
Look, my daughter
was not sick.

487
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:56,002
Then Vanessa never mentioned
that she was seeing
a psychiatrist?

488
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,238
(SIGHS)

489
00:23:03,853 --> 00:23:04,911
No.

490
00:23:04,987 --> 00:23:06,648
Ray, maybe she was ashamed.

491
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,991
No daughter wants to
disappoint her father.

492
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,257
Vanessa's "problem"
was that bastard
Perry Williams.

493
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,561
He murdered her,
even if he didn't
pull the trigger.

494
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:23,469
But Iegally, Ray,
Iegally he's not
responsible for her death.

495
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,701
Can you give us
the name of her doctor?

496
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:28,471
I don't know.

497
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:32,844
She was using the college
health care service.

498
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,553
Could you all
just please Ieave?

499
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:50,327
Vanessa wanted help
controlling her behavior.

500
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:54,335
The Iithium worked,
and in combination
with psychotherapy...

501
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:58,106
Well, she was making
excellent progress.

502
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,574
Did she ever mention
a Perry Williams in therapy?

503
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:01,769
Yes.

504
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:05,177
He was encouraging her
to drink and stop
taking her meds.

505
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:06,544
STABLER: Why?

506
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:10,252
To make her more vulnerable,
more manic.

507
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,719
He Iiked being with
a hyper-sexual party girl.

508
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:16,082
When she began to stabilize,
he Iost his control over her.

509
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:18,820
That's when she realized
he was abusing her.

510
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:20,521
Well, why'd she keep
going out with him?

511
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:24,157
Well, he's a handsome,
successful older man.
She was blinded by his charm.

512
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:27,361
Our tox screen shows
that Vanessa had stopped
taking the Iithium.

513
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:31,300
Now you know what can happen
to a manic depressive
when they go off their meds.

514
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:32,772
What did you
do about it?

515
00:24:32,842 --> 00:24:34,070
What could I do?

516
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:36,304
She's an adult Iegally free
to make her own choices.

517
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:37,402
STABLER: She was suicidal.

518
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,471
Not Iast week
when I saw her.

519
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:43,848
You should have
told her father
what was going on.

520
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:48,285
The only way
I could've disclosed anything

521
00:24:48,357 --> 00:24:52,794
is if she'd been
homicidal or suicidal
and as I said, she wasn't.

522
00:24:54,363 --> 00:24:57,560
Did Vanessa ever mention
confiding in anybody else?

523
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:03,070
She was keeping
a therapy journal.

524
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:08,466
Vanessa's roommate had
the diary. I can see why
she kept it hidden from Ray.

525
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:11,775
It's graphic sexual stuff,
a catalog of
Perry's perversions.

526
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:14,441
He's a sexual sadist,
he doesn't want a partner,
he wants a victim.

527
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:15,848
I'm not sure
that's enough.

528
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:18,512
We talked to several
of Perry's ex-girlfriends.

529
00:25:18,587 --> 00:25:21,351
He gets off on pain,
they'II all testify to that.

530
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:22,685
Were they raped?

531
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:24,216
No, but...

532
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:25,624
But then
it's not enough.

533
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,719
Vanessa's body showed signs
of sexual trauma.

534
00:25:27,796 --> 00:25:30,424
Well, Perry will argue
that it was rough
but consensual sex.

535
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:32,899
And we've got her statements
to the psychiatrist

536
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:35,061
and the rape crisis counselor,
that she was forced.

537
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:38,504
AII right, those I can get
admitted under the outcry
exception to the hearsay rule,

538
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:40,974
but I would still Iike
a confession from Perry.

539
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:42,704
AIex, it's all in here.

540
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:44,268
Everything that
he did to her.

541
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:45,779
"I'm still bleeding
from Iast night.

542
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:48,476
"I should go to the hospital,
but I'm too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

543
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:52,180
"When I said I couldn't have
sex tonight, he punched me
so hard I couldn't breathe."

544
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:55,184
Let's go after him
for the rape.

545
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,089
But, just in case, tell
Ray to file a civil suit.

546
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,123
CIean Perry out.

547
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,357
At Ieast arresting Perry
might give Ray some closure.

548
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:03,865
Maybe you, too.

549
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,595
EIIiot, can I talk
to you for a minute?

550
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:06,931
I'II meet you
down in the car.

00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:08,027
What you got?

552
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:09,696
Ray Bevins came by
to see me,

553
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:13,300
asked questions
about why we ruled
Vanessa's death a suicide.

554
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,003
He accept it?

555
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:18,377
I walked him through
the evidence as gently
as I could, but I screwed up.

556
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:20,848
I mentioned the oral sodomy.
I thought you told him.

557
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:24,045
No. I didn't want to put
that image in his head.

558
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,111
His daughter on her knees
in some filthy alley.

559
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:28,350
I'm sorry,
but it's in there now.

She wouldn't
want you to do this.

00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:41,414
He killed a sexual predator
that you said
we couldn't convict.

608
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:43,952
I will not
condone vigilantism.

609
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:47,984
I am not going to Iet
my compassion for Ray
prevent me from doing my job.

610
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:50,651
Well, I did my job.
I arrested him.
He's all yours.

611
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:59,894
I want manslaughter
and probation. Extreme
emotional disturbance.

612
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:03,632
Ray snapped when he found out
his daughter's rapist would go
unpunished for his crime.

613
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:06,436
For someone who snapped,
your client was
thinking clearly enough

614
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:09,740
to obtain a weapon,
Iocate the defendant,
and execute him.

615
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:11,713
That's not
temporary insanity.

616
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:15,842
You know the EED
statute was designed
to downgrade murder charges,

617
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,945
when they are
mitigated by the defendant's
severe psychological trauma.

618
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:22,958
Only when the defendant's
mental state creates a Ioss
of self-control.

619
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:25,324
Ray's actions appear
deliberate and rational.

620
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:28,364
Don't take our word for it,
have your shrink evaluate Ray.

621
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:34,259
Perry Williams
killed my daughter.

622
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:38,967
He took her to
such a dark place that
she couldn't find a way out.

623
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:42,375
So what did you do?

624
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,970
Guy I know at the work site
gave me the gun.

625
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:50,578
I went to the club,
said I had an appointment
with Perry

626
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,881
and waited in his office.

627
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:56,257
And what happened after that?

628
00:30:58,027 --> 00:30:59,289
Perry walked in.

629
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:04,298
I confronted him
with Vanessa's rape.

630
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,096
He denied it, and then...

631
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:12,771
Then he said that she Iiked
what he did to her.

632
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:18,806
Ray, how did Perry
end up in the alley?

633
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:23,318
I took him there.

634
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:27,287
I forced him to his knees,
the way he forced
Vanessa to her knees.

635
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:31,350
He begged for his Iife,
he swore that he would
tell the truth to the cops.

636
00:31:32,862 --> 00:31:35,262
I said enough,
you know, enough Iies.

637
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,336
So I put the gun in his mouth,
and I pulled the trigger.

638
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,077
Ray's emotional pain
is genuine

639
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:58,177
and the cause for his mental
trauma is Iegitimate,

640
00:31:58,254 --> 00:31:59,812
but I don't buy
his affirmative defense.

641
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:02,016
Why the hell not?
This is a man who's
Iost his daughter.

642
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:05,151
Well, despite his
emotional distress,
he had the presence of mind

643
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:07,526
to carefully
plan this murder.
He knew right from wrong.

644
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:10,430
He knew nothing.
This is a guy
drowning in grief.

645
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,992
HUANG: Ray made clear,
Iogical, and deliberate
choices.

646
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,560
He forced Perry
out into that alley

647
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:18,106
and symbolically re-enacted
his daughter's rape
and murder.

648
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:19,641
He didn't shoot
Perry in the chest.

649
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:24,112
No, he put the gun
in Perry's mouth,
imitating the oral sodomy.

650
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,273
I'II notify Ray's attorney
that we're gonna fight it.

651
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:30,046
She'II probably try for
jury nullification, get them
to acquit out of sympathy.

652
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,450
They should.

653
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:34,149
Look. I'm not mourning
for Perry Williams,

654
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:36,248
but I'm not rolling
over for Ray, either.

655
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:38,123
I need that report as
soon as you can get it.

656
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:44,828
I could've stopped him.
I should've known
what Ray was gonna do.

657
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:47,828
How?

658
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,303
I'd have done
the same thing.

659
00:32:49,372 --> 00:32:50,737
No, you wouldn't.

660
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,070
Wait till
you're a parent.

661
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:58,238
Don't throw that
crap at me, EIIiot.
You made a mistake.

662
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:03,541
What?

663
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,314
You Iet Ray in.

664
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,421
You're right, I did.

665
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:15,827
He got to me,
and now I'm responsible.

666
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,300
I don't remember
Ieaving the nightclub.

667
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:25,273
EMMETT: What's the next
thing you do remember?

668
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:31,607
Sitting in the park,
by the Iake.

669
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:37,352
Vanessa and I went there
since she was a Iittle girl.

670
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:43,448
She would feed the ducks her
sandwiches when she thought
I wasn't Iooking.

671
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:45,517
But you still had the gun?

672
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:47,451
Yes.

673
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,124
What were you
going to do next?

674
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,697
Shoot myself,
so that I could be
with my daughter.

675
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,235
Thank you.
No further questions.

676
00:34:04,347 --> 00:34:06,838
You blame Perry Williams
for your daughter's death?

677
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:10,952
Yeah, he raped Vanessa
and that's why
she killed herself.

678
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,783
CABOT: You sound very
certain of that.

679
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:15,255
But Vanessa was
emotionally unstable,
wasn't she?

680
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:16,450
BEVINS: He made her that way.

681
00:34:16,526 --> 00:34:18,551
Mr. Bevins, she was
under psychiatric care

682
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:21,153
and had been
prescribed Iithium
for a bipolar disorder.

683
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,960
Are you suggesting
that Perry Williams
was responsible for that?

684
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:28,766
He Iowered her self-esteem,
and told her not to
take her medication.

685
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:32,341
My daughter was
happy and healthy,

686
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,535
before she
worked at that club.

687
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,237
As far as you knew.

688
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:40,078
There was quite a bit
about her Iife that
Vanessa did not tell you.

689
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:42,447
Did she tell you
that she had been
sexually assaulted?

690
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:44,844
No.

691
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,912
CABOT: So her relationship
with Perry Williams

692
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:49,219
could have been
consensual as he claimed.

693
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:53,393
You call the deceased
a rapist, but you have
no evidence

694
00:34:53,463 --> 00:34:54,828
other than your
personal beliefs.

695
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:56,330
That's not true.

696
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,062
Detective Stabler told me
that Perry Williams
raped my daughter.

697
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:05,601
Thank you.
Nothing further.

698
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:11,677
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

699
00:35:11,747 --> 00:35:13,271
You're calling
me to the stand?

700
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:15,647
No, the Defense is.

701
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:17,948
You've just become
their star witness.

702
00:35:18,488 --> 00:35:19,785
Excuse me?

703
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:24,154
EIIiot, did you tell Ray
that you knew Perry Williams
had raped Vanessa?

704
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:25,956
No.
He says you did.

705
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:29,193
I told him
Perry was a suspect.

706
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:32,496
Now they're going to
use you to justify
Ray murdering Perry.

707
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,502
Yeah? Well, the hell with him.
He got what he deserved.

708
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,333
Well, now it's your turn.

709
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:40,000
You gave premature information
to an unstable man.

710
00:35:41,811 --> 00:35:45,042
You sure as hell
better be ready
when I cross-examine you.

711
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:55,416
Detective Stabler,
did you have a conversation

712
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:57,652
with Ray Bevins
about Perry Williams?

713
00:35:58,127 --> 00:35:59,185
Yes.

714
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:01,594
Do you remember the content
of that conversation?

715
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,097
Not word for word, no.

716
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,895
Do you remember
telling Ray Bevins

717
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:07,435
that you believed
Perry Williams
raped his daughter?

718
00:36:09,038 --> 00:36:11,029
I said we were
Iooking at him.

719
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:13,507
Did you say, quote,
"We're gonna get the guy."

720
00:36:14,477 --> 00:36:15,535
Yes, I said that.

721
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:17,010
Who did "the guy" refer to?

722
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,571
STABLER: The killer. It didn't
necessarily mean that I was
Iooking at Perry Williams.

723
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:24,381
But it's reasonable to assume
that Ray believed
you meant Mr. Williams.

724
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:28,822
Now, did you tell Ray
that you were powerless
to arrest Mr. Williams?

725
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:30,791
At the time,
we didn't have
enough evidence.

726
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,351
Yes or no, Detective.

727
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:36,262
At the time of the murder
did my client believe

728
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:39,665
you would ever be able
to arrest Mr. Williams?

729
00:36:41,537 --> 00:36:42,834
No.

730
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:45,868
Thank you.

731
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:53,478
"We're gonna get the guy."

732
00:36:53,549 --> 00:36:55,608
Detective Stabler,
when you made that
remark to the defendant,

733
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:58,779
was it based on
any official determination
from the NYPD?

734
00:36:59,388 --> 00:37:02,482
"Official determination"? No.

735
00:37:02,558 --> 00:37:04,958
Was it based on
any forensic evidence?

736
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:08,258
Yes, we had Perry Williams'
DNA on Vanessa's body.

737
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:10,993
DNA proves that sex
took place, not rape.

738
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:12,159
We had her diary.

739
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:13,998
A person, Detective,
not her writings.

740
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,503
We had the rape
crisis counselor.

741
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,198
An eyewitness, Detective.

742
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:22,971
No.

743
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,203
So your statement
to the defendant,

744
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:30,014
that Perry Williams raped
Vanessa was based purely
on your individual opinion?

745
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,585
Yes.

746
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:36,023
Then why did
you say that?

747
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:37,889
Because he needed
something to hold onto.

748
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,326
So your sympathy
for the defendant

749
00:37:40,396 --> 00:37:43,854
Ied you to give Ray Bevins
unsubstantiated information?

750
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:47,230
Yes.

751
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:52,338
Detective Stabler,
do you condone Ray Bevins'
murder of Perry Williams?

752
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:01,273
Detective?

753
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:09,051
No.

754
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:12,757
It was wrong.

755
00:38:16,532 --> 00:38:18,193
Nothing further.

756
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:29,039
The Iaw is supposed to provide
us with safety and justice

757
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:32,239
but the Iaw failed to get
justice for Vanessa Bevins.

758
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:34,941
And in his time of grief,

759
00:38:35,017 --> 00:38:39,977
Ray Bevins Iearned that
the man who had abused,
humiliated,

760
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:43,548
and raped his daughter
was going to walk free.

761
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,590
Now, if it were your daughter,

762
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:53,363
your wife, your mother,
who had been raped

763
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:58,567
and the police were unable
to arrest their attacker,
how would you feel?

764
00:39:00,543 --> 00:39:03,979
Ray Bevins suffered
every parent's nightmare.

765
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:07,882
He did what every parent
knows in their heart
they would do.

766
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,080
He acted from
a place of profound grief,
of overwhelming Ioss.

767
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:15,717
He did not have
control of his actions.

768
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:19,853
He tried to get
justice for his daughter
in the only way he knew how.

769
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:23,788
And now you must make
justice for Ray Bevins,

770
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:27,328
and return a verdict
of not guilty.

771
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,511
Some of you may believe that
Perry Williams raped
Vanessa Bevins in that alley,

772
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:45,081
but Perry Williams
is not on trial here.

773
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:47,920
In fact, he never got
his day in court at all.

774
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:51,153
So in the eyes of the Iaw,
he is innocent
until proven guilty.

775
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:56,564
Even if his guilt
had been established
beyond a reasonable doubt,

776
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:59,192
he could not
have been executed
for his crime.

777
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:02,765
Ray Bevins executed
Perry Williams.

778
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:07,665
He shot a man,
who was on his knees,
begging for his Iife.

779
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:11,011
Now some of you may think
that he deserved to die.

780
00:40:12,548 --> 00:40:13,708
But you have to
ask yourselves

781
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:16,980
if you would execute
a man whose guilt had
not been proven.

782
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:22,355
We have all felt
the need for revenge
at some point in our Iives.

783
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:24,893
We have all Iashed
out in pain and anger,

784
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,555
and we have all thought
that justice means
an eye for an eye.

785
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:30,360
But is that justice?

786
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,864
Does Perry Williams' family
now have the right
to kill Ray Bevins?

787
00:40:34,937 --> 00:40:38,429
Does Ray Bevins' family then
have the right to retaliate
against Perry Williams?

788
00:40:38,507 --> 00:40:40,236
When would it stop?

789
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,975
An eye for an eye
Ieaves the whole world blind.

790
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,151
LARSEN: Has the jury
reached its verdict?

791
00:40:58,227 --> 00:40:59,854
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

792
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,920
Will the defendant
please rise?

793
00:41:06,235 --> 00:41:10,968
LARSEN: On the count of murder
in the Second Degree,
how does the jury find?

794
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,342
We find the defendant,
Raymond Bevins,
guilty.

795
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:20,980
LARSEN: Thank you for
your service. You're excused.

796
00:41:39,768 --> 00:41:41,599
Ray.

797
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:45,167
I'm sorry.

798
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:48,276
I'm not.
