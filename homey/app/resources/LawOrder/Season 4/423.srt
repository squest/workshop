a sample so you can frame
me with my own cells.

154
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:53,969
Why would we do that?

155
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:58,173
I don't know.
Why would you stick a plunger
up Abner Louima's ass?

156
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,877
If you want anything from me,
come back with a warrant.

157
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:04,146
I believe
that's check and mate.

158
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,121
Sure is, smartass.

159
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:14,660
STABLER: Couldn't get a DNA
sample from our suspect,
but I think we got prints.

160
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:17,126
Index finger
and thumb.

161
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,224
I'II see if I can Iift
a print off the body.

162
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:21,292
Meanwhile, I've got
Iots to work with.

163
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,167
There's evidence
of vaginal trauma,

164
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,935
I've got the perp's fluids,
and I got skin cells,

165
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,566
from underneath
her acrylic nails.

166
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,133
Great for trapping evidence.

167
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:30,974
Could explain
the Band-Aid
on Donovan's neck.

168
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,741
Vanessa clawed
the son of a bitch.

169
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,180
She wasn't
the only one.

170
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,445
The blood on the cat's fur
was Vanessa's,

171
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,249
but the blood on its claws,
was a match to the perp.

172
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:41,016
We gotta get
Donovan's DNA.

173
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,024
I'II get the prints off
the chess piece and send them

174
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:45,219
over to Ballistics
to compare with the gun.

175
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:49,655
I dusted the gun.
The wooden grip is too
textured to raise prints,

176
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:51,700
and only your victim's
are on the barrel.

177
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,234
Like Vanessa
tried to grab it.

178
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:55,998
AIso found a greasy
substance on the weapon.

179
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,095
Gun cleaning fluid?

180
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,106
No, I'd recognize
that in my sleep.

181
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:00,641
I'II run some
tests on it.

182
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:01,801
So that's it?

183
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:03,538
Would I waste your time?

184
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:05,273
I've got the gun owner.

185
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,611
You mean we have a Iegal,
registered piece?

186
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:11,744
Mmm-hmm. Carry permit comes
back to Marvin KIigman,
address on Park Avenue.

187
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:15,247
Sure, Marvin had a gun.

188
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:19,055
My Iate husband,
may he rest in peace,
was in the diamond trade.

189
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:20,926
Dangerous business.

190
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:22,759
MUNCH: Where's the gun now,
Mrs. KIigman?

191
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,991
In my Iock box.

192
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:25,328
May we see it?

193
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,063
Of course.

194
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,298
Does anyone else
have access to the gun?

195
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:34,308
Only my son.
He Iives in the dorms.
At Hudson University.

196
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,284
It's gone.

197
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:48,321
I didn't take
my father's gun.

198
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,551
How did it get used
to kill your classmate?

199
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,890
I don't know anything
about Vanessa's murder.

200
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:54,793
But you do know her.
Yeah.

201
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:56,262
Yeah? You sleeping with her?

202
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:57,424
Yeah, I wish.

203
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:58,989
BENSON: Where were you
Iast night?

204
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:02,697
At an all-night cram session
with my study group.
Go check.

205
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:06,969
Oh, we will, but right now
you're the one who's Iooking
good for this murder.

206
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,470
Okay.

207
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,540
I got a Iittle over-extended
on the Super Bowl.

208
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:15,015
I was gonna sell the gun,
but someone stole it.

209
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:16,608
You know Donovan AIvarez?

210
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:17,777
Yeah, sure,
he Iives down my hall.

211
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:18,842
Could he
have stolen it?

212
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:19,943
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

213
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,250
I don't know...

214
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:22,585
Stabler.

215
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:24,182
Did Donovan ever
see the gun?

216
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,523
Yeah, I was Iooking
for a buyer.

217
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:28,529
I showed it to a Iot
of people, including Donovan.

218
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:30,394
Did he see
where you kept it?

219
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,058
Yeah, yeah,
in my desk.

220
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,694
Warner. She wants
to talk to us.

221
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:39,567
You fumed her.

222
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,667
It's amazing
what you can do
with crazy glue.

223
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:45,009
Vaporize it,
and when it hardens,
you can dust a print on skin.

224
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,172
Where's the print?

225
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:48,842
On the inside of her
right wrist, where
there's deep bruising.

226
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,441
STABLER: Like someone
grabbed her hard.

227
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,043
With the glue,
it's as clear as day.

228
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:53,418
Donovan AIvarez?

229
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,013
Ten point match.

230
00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:59,490
PROFESSOR:
In People v. Carmichael,
the M.E. ruled that the death

231
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:02,496
was due to undetermined
homicidal violence.

232
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,126
How did the District Attorney
get a conviction?

233
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:09,136
Donovan AIvarez, you're under
arrest for the murder
of Vanessa Bevins.

234
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:10,296
PROFESSOR: Hey, what do
you think you're doing?

235
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:11,464
You can't do this.
Sure we can.

236
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,529
What do you think
you're doing?

237
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,542
Your teacher
cover Miranda yet?
What's going on? Hey!

238
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,508
You have the right
to remain silent.

239
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:18,045
If you give up that right,
anything you say
can and will be used...

240
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:23,147
This is your Iast chance,
Donovan.

241
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:24,617
Just tell us the truth.

242
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:27,520
Once there's a DNA match,
no one will care
what you say.

243
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,216
I am telling the truth,
all right.

244
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,226
I didn't kill Vanessa.
I only went to the club
to talk to her.

245
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:33,818
Because you were pissed off
that she broke up with you?

246
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:35,989
No, I was pissed because
she stole my credit card

247
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:38,533
and spent thousands
of dollars on crazy stuff.

248
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,228
That sounds Iike a good
motive to drag her out
to the alley and kill her.

249
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:42,463
No.

250
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:46,270
We were arguing because
Vanessa said she had bigger
problems than paying me back.

251
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,899
So then you pulled
the gun to make her
take you seriously.

252
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:49,136
No, I didn't have a gun.

253
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:50,872
Come on, Donovan.

254
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:53,574
Vanessa was killed with a gun
stolen from your dorm.

255
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,879
I don't know
anything about that.

256
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:58,511
Why don't you believe me?
I could never hurt Vanessa.

257
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,613
You grabbed her so hard
your prints were
bruised into her flesh.

258
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,250
She was walking away.
I grabbed her arm
so I could stop her.

259
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,226
Is that when
she scratched your neck?

260
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:07,853
I cut myself shaving.

261
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,526
See for yourself.

262
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,226
Does this Iook
Iike a scratch?

263
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:17,696
BENSON: You believe his story?
I don't know.

264
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,400
Vanessa's on drugs,
desperate for money,

265
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:21,534
she steals from
her ex-boyfriend.
Sounds Iike motive to me.

266
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,273
Donovan can't explain how
Vanessa was shot with a gun
that he had access to?

267
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:30,717
Something wrong?

268
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,147
Yeah. Ray Bevins,
he called five times.

269
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:36,020
CRAGEN: DNA's back.

270
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:39,117
The semen, fingernail
scrapings, and the blood
on the cat's claw,

271
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:40,923
all come from
the same person.

272
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:43,055
And it's not
Donovan AIvarez.

273
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:47,197
So, Vanessa had
sex with someone else
earlier that night,

274
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,100
and then Donovan
shoots her in the alley.

275
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:52,868
Possible, but not enough to
hold a kid you arrested in
front of a criminal Iaw class.

276
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:54,067
BENSON: We can't
cut him Ioose.

277
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,770
And we can't
talk to him anymore.

278
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:57,004
BENSON: Why's that?

279
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,309
Professor called and
Iawyered up for him.

280
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:00,473
Ray.

281
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:01,607
Detective.

282
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:03,173
It's the middle of the night.
What are you doing here?

283
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:04,446
I called.

284
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,954
I know. I haven't had a chance
to get back to you. I'm sorry.

285
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,388
I just wanted to know
if you had any Ieads.

286
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,449
Yeah, we're making progress.

287
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:15,888
Can't you tell
me anything?

288
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,489
No. Ray, go home.
Get some sleep.

289
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,556
I can't.

290
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:22,533
I can't...
I mean,
I can't sleep.

291
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:25,072
I just keep seeing
Vanessa's face,
in the morgue.

292
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,471
Ray...

293
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:29,272
If I have any news,
I'II call you.
I promise. You have my word.

294
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:32,973
Now go home.
Go home.

295
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:39,615
Hey, how's he doing?

296
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,121
He's a mess.

297
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:44,225
The Iogs on Vanessa's phone.
Check out this number.

298
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:46,622
Dozens of calls to it.

299
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,128
It's the Rape
Crisis Center.

300
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:52,023
Why was Vanessa
calling them two weeks
before she was raped?

301
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:57,400
Vanessa must've called me
20 times, but she never
gave a Iast name.

302
00:13:57,472 --> 00:13:59,633
I was afraid if I pushed
too hard, she'd stop calling.

303
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,505
I know what she said
is confidential...

304
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:05,673
And any father would
waive confidentiality
to catch his child's killer.

305
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:07,273
Let's cut
the red tape.

306
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:09,283
Good. Why was Vanessa
calling you?

307
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:12,718
She was in
a sexual relationship
she couldn't handle.

308
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:14,050
So, she was raped.

309
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:15,783
She wasn't sure.

310
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:19,988
She needed help understanding
what had happened to her,
but it was rape all right.

311
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:22,292
She had gotten involved
with this man that she met.

312
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:23,991
Donovan AIvarez?

313
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:26,159
She never gave his name.

314
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:29,170
He was a sadist.
He Iiked to degrade her.

315
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:32,173
Make her have sex
in public places.
Get rough.

316
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,505
When she refused,
he beat her up.

317
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,204
After that she was too
scared to say no again.

318
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,008
Why didn't she
call the police?

319
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,673
I gave her your number.

320
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:44,149
Vanessa just wasn't ready.
She was very depressed.

321
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,516
She kept blaming herself
instead of her boss.

322
00:14:49,324 --> 00:14:50,382
Her boss?

323
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,917
Yeah, that's
who was raping her.

324
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,461
Look, I understand
the need for investigation.

325
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,502
I just don't see
how I can help you.

326
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,629
Well, you were at the club,
weren't you?

327
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:07,573
I was in the VIP room.
I told that to the officers
who interviewed me.

328
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:09,611
You didn't tell them
you were sleeping
with the victim.

329
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:12,338
(SIGHS)

330
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:16,974
Well, now I see.
Someone's been talking
about me behind my back.

331
00:15:17,052 --> 00:15:20,419
Then Iet's talk openly,
in our squad room.

332
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,724
Baby, I'm going now.
You'II call me Iater?

333
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:26,683
Come here.

334
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:29,157
You know I will.

335
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,665
Give me a moment to call
my Iawyer. I'II have him
meet me there.

336
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,798
There's no need to.
You're not under arrest.

337
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,467
And I'd Iike to
keep it that way.

338
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:47,746
My client is more than
happy to assist in
the investigation.

339
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:48,976
He'II answer
your questions.

340
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:50,450
Why don't we Iet
his DNA sample
do the talking?

341
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,647
Oh, hey, take a swab.
It'II match.

342
00:15:54,423 --> 00:15:56,983
I'm sure
you'II find my blood
in the alleyway, too.

343
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,391
Damn cat clawed
the hell out of my ass.

344
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:59,328
Listen, I had sex
with Vanessa that night.
That's not a crime.

345
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,694
Rape and sodomy are.

346
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,565
(SCOFFS)

347
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:07,936
Rape? Detective,
I don't need to force
women to have sex with me.

348
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:10,839
Oh, so you expect
us to believe

349
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,604
that Vanessa Iiked
being half-naked,

350
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:15,111
down on her knees
in a dirty alley?

351
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,738
Yeah, she grew to Iike it.

352
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:18,680
Once you stripped away
that schoolgirl exterior,

353
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,117
underneath Iay
a very adventurous woman.

354
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:26,315
Why'd you go out back?

355
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,052
I don't Iike to
share my girls.

356
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:29,860
I saw Vanessa go
outside with a friend.

357
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,919
I went to make sure
they weren't
having a quickie.

358
00:16:31,997 --> 00:16:33,123
Were they?

359
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:35,063
No, no. Her tastes
had changed.

360
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:36,930
She told him to
get the hell out.

361
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:38,230
BENSON: So,
did you see him Ieave?

362
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:39,793
He got into a cab.

363
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:43,307
Vanessa and I had
a Iittle fun,
and then I went back inside.

364
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,503
So she fought
with her boyfriend,
had sex with you,

365
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:49,604
and then, a third guy
came along and he killed her.

366
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:50,978
Is that what
you're telling me?

367
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,347
Truth is stranger
than fiction.

368
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:00,422
But you're the only one
with a history
of abusing Vanessa.

369
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:01,618
Oh, more gossip?

370
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,923
BENSON: No, we have witnesses.

371
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:08,197
Vanessa told people
about your repeated
sexual assault.

372
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:10,894
I don't recall anyone
watching us having sex.

373
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:14,132
So unless you guys
communicate with ghosts,
you've got nothing.

374
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,639
AII right. My client
has answered all
of your questions.

375
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,302
So, unless
you're arresting him,
we're Ieaving.

376
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:20,366
(CLEARS THROAT)

377
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,314
You'II notify me
if you want to speak
to my client any further.

378
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:29,012
Oh, we'II be speaking
to him again, yeah.

379
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,315
Come on.

380
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,883
Detective Stabler,
any news about Vanessa?

381
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,017
Are you her father?
Yeah.

382
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,391
Hey, I'm really sorry.

383
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:39,930
Thanks. Who are you?

384
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:43,132
Oh, sorry,
Perry Williams.

385
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:44,828
How do you know
my daughter?

386
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:46,871
I was her boss.
Let's talk. Come on.

387
00:17:46,938 --> 00:17:48,963
She was really sweet.
What?

388
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:51,602
Why are you here?

389
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:52,973
WILLIAMS: I'm just answering
a few questions.

390
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:54,671
About what?

391
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:56,338
My relationship
with your daughter.

392
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:58,473
You bastard! You raped
and murdered my daughter.

393
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,074
Hey, hey, I didn't
have to rape her.

394
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:01,618
And I sure
didn't kill her.

395
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,176
He's not worth it.
Let him go. AII right?

396
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:05,279
AII right, all right.
Come on.

397
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,525
Ray, you've gotta
stop coming here.

398
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:10,959
I got nothing
else to do.

399
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,223
What about your job?

400
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:14,492
I don't give a damn
about my work anymore.

401
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,664
You're never going
to make an arrest.

402
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:22,205
It's been three days, Ray.
You gotta give me time.

403
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:25,504
That filth killed my daughter
and you're just gonna Iet him
walk out the door.

404
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:28,205
We don't have enough evidence
to arrest him for murder yet.

405
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,110
You could at Ieast
arrest him for rape.

406
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,979
He's claiming their
relationship was consensual.

407
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,316
That's crazy.
We need the proof.

408
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:39,515
What do you think?
It doesn't matter
what I think, Ray.

409
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:41,786
In your heart,
what do you think?

410
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,795

412
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,003
Just tell me...

413
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:58,599
Did he rape her?

00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:02,773

at him for it.

(SIGHS)

417

get the guy.

418
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,254
Thanks.

419
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:30,035
Go home.

420
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,632
You sound Iike
me talking to Ray.

421
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,940
EIIiot, there's nothing
we can do tonight.

422
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:37,106
We'II start fresh
in the morning.

423
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:39,309
I need to get
that bastard.

424
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:42,012
PIenty of other bastards
out there, EIIiot,
why this one?

425
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:44,488
You know why.

426
00:19:45,924 --> 00:19:47,892
I'm gonna go catch
a few hours of sleep.

427
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:49,959
See you at 7:00.

428
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,430
Hey, it's Stabler.
Sorry to bother you so Iate,

429
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,194
I need you to do
me a big favor.

430
00:19:57,268 --> 00:19:59,133
You gotta run
the tests tonight.

431
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:04,472
I burned a sample
of the greasy residue
in the gas chromatograph.

432
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:05,736
Tell me it nails
Perry Williams.

433
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,300
Hear me out.

434
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:11,109
The grease on the gun
had three component
organic substances.

435
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:13,878
The first two are
Ianolin and talc.

436
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:15,647
Skin care products?
Exactly.

437
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,779
Chemical compositions
identical to the Iotion

438
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:19,880
and face powder
brands Vanessa used.

439
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,925
So the gun
touched her skin.

440
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:25,019
It doesn't explain the flakes
trapped in the Iotion.

441
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:29,726
Cured tobacco, same brand
as the cigarettes we found
in Vanessa's purse.

442
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,234
Vanessa was carrying
the gun.

443
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,066
She tried to defend herself.
Perp took it away
and shot her.

444
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,299
You'd think so,

445
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:41,971
but I decided to take
another Iook at the residue
pattern on Vanessa's hands.

446
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:43,070
Here it is.

447
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:46,844
But that residue
pattern is not consistent
with any defensive posture.

448
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:51,014
Not Iike this.
Not Iike this. And so on.

449
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,351
So you have no match.

450
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:54,288
I think there
might be.

451
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,826
Like this.

452
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:04,925
Fire in the hole.

453
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,440
It's a match.

454
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,645
Vanessa killed herself.

455
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:29,754
Perry Williams raped Vanessa
and it drove her to suicide.

456
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:33,285
She steals the gun,
brings it down to
the alley to kill him,

457
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:34,353
Ioses her nerve.

458
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:38,095
When Perry rapes her again,
it's the Iast straw,
so she kills herself.

459
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,934
This bastards gonna escape,
we got nothing on the rape.

460
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:44,441
You know, maybe Vanessa told
someone in person, other than
the rape crisis counselor.

461
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:46,602
We get an outcry witness,
we got ourselves a chance.

462
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:48,976
Ray didn't know,
none of her friends knew.

463
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:50,912
Hell, no one even
knew she was suicidal.

464
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:52,779
They all say
she was a party girl.

465
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,910
This may explain why.
Vanessa's toxicology report.

466
00:21:55,987 --> 00:21:57,921
It says that her
blood was positive
for Iithium.

467
00:21:57,989 --> 00:21:59,013
What's that used for?

468
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,853
For treating
bi-polar disorder.

469
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:03,291
No wonder she was
flying high one day,
and crashing the next.

470
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:06,888
Promiscuous, going on spending
sprees, explains why everyone
thought she was on drugs.

471
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:08,158
It also explains
her inability

472
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:10,928
to break off from
Perry Williams despite
his treatment of her.

473
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:12,264
So why didn't
the Iithium help?

474
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:15,465
Because the amount
found in her blood
wasn't a therapeutic dose.

475
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,100
My guess is she stopped
taking her meds a week ago.

476
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:20,508
So why didn't anybody
tell us about her diagnosis?

477
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:22,773
This is a woman
who suffered in silence.

478
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:26,645
Now, I gotta tell Ray
his only child killed herself.

479
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:29,644
First you tell me she's
on drugs. Now you tell me
that she's crazy,

480
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:32,781
and I'm telling you
I know my daughter,
and she was never suicidal.

481
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:34,586
If you'd Iike,
you can talk to
our medical examiner.

482
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,320
She can explain how
she came to the findings.

483
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:38,089
Thank you.
You know what,
I will.

484
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:43,125
Did you know that she
was taking medication
for bipolar disorder?

485
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:46,227
She was moody.
I mean, she felt
things very intensely.

486
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:50,400
She was a caring...
Look, my daughter
was not sick.

487
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:54,002
Then Vanessa never mentioned
that she was seeing
a psychiatrist?

488
00:22:58,249 --> 00:22:59,238
(SIGHS)

489
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:02,911
No.

490
00:23:02,987 --> 00:23:04,648
Ray, maybe she was ashamed.

491
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,991
No daughter wants to
disappoint her father.

492
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,257
Vanessa's "problem"
was that bastard
Perry Williams.

493
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,561
He murdered her,
even if he didn't
pull the trigger.

494
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:21,469
But Iegally, Ray,
Iegally he's not
responsible for her death.

495
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,701
Can you give us
the name of her doctor?

496
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:26,471
I don't know.

497
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:30,844
She was using the college
health care service.

498
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,553
Could you all
just please Ieave?

499
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:48,327
Vanessa wanted help
controlling her behavior.

500
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:52,335
The Iithium worked,
and in combination
with psychotherapy...

501
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:56,106
Well, she was making
excellent progress.

502
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:58,574
Did she ever mention
a Perry Williams in therapy?

503
00:23:58,643 --> 00:23:59,769
Yes.

504
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:03,177
He was encouraging her
to drink and stop
taking her meds.

505
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:04,544
STABLER: Why?

506
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:08,252
To make her more vulnerable,
more manic.

507
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,719
He Iiked being with
a hyper-sexual party girl.

508
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:14,082
When she began to stabilize,
he Iost his control over her.

509
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:16,820
That's when she realized
he was abusing her.

510
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,521
Well, why'd she keep
going out with him?

511
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:22,157
Well, he's a handsome,
successful older man.
She was blinded by his charm.

512
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:25,361
Our tox screen shows
that Vanessa had stopped
taking the Iithium.

513
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:29,300
Now you know what can happen
to a manic depressive
when they go off their meds.

514
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:30,772
What did you
do about it?

515
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,070
What could I do?

516
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:34,304
She's an adult Iegally free
to make her own choices.

517
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:35,402
STABLER: She was suicidal.

518
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,471
Not Iast week
when I saw her.

519
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:41,848
You should have
told her father
what was going on.

520
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:46,285
The only way
I could've disclosed anything

521
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:50,794
is if she'd been
homicidal or suicidal
and as I said, she wasn't.

522
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:55,560
Did Vanessa ever mention
confiding in anybody else?

523
00:24:57,134 --> 00:25:01,070
She was keeping
a therapy journal.

524
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:06,466
Vanessa's roommate had
the diary. I can see why
she kept it hidden from Ray.

525
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:09,775
It's graphic sexual stuff,
a catalog of
Perry's perversions.

526
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:12,441
He's a sexual sadist,
he doesn't want a partner,
he wants a victim.

527
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:13,848
I'm not sure
that's enough.

528
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:16,512
We talked to several
of Perry's ex-girlfriends.

529
00:25:16,587 --> 00:25:19,351
He gets off on pain,
they'II all testify to that.

530
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:20,685
Were they raped?

531
00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:22,216
No, but...

532
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:23,624
But then
it's not enough.

533
00:25:23,694 --> 00:25:25,719
Vanessa's body showed signs
of sexual trauma.

534
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:28,424
Well, Perry will argue
that it was rough
but consensual sex.

535
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,899
And we've got her statements
to the psychiatrist

536
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:33,061
and the rape crisis counselor,
that she was forced.

537
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:36,504
AII right, those I can get
admitted under the outcry
exception to the hearsay rule,

538
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:38,974
but I would still Iike
a confession from Perry.

539
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:40,704
AIex, it's all in here.

540
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:42,268
Everything that
he did to her.

541
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,779
"I'm still bleeding
from Iast night.

542
00:25:43,848 --> 00:25:46,476
"I should go to the hospital,
but I'm too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

543
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:50,180
"When I said I couldn't have
sex tonight, he punched me
so hard I couldn't breathe."

544
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:53,184
Let's go after him
for the rape.

545
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,089
But, just in case, tell
Ray to file a civil suit.

546
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:57,123
CIean Perry out.

547
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,357
At Ieast arresting Perry
might give Ray some closure.

548
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:01,865
Maybe you, too.

549
00:26:01,934 --> 00:26:03,595
EIIiot, can I talk
to you for a minute?

550

down in the car.

What you got?

552
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:07,696
Ray Bevins came by
to see me,

553
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:11,300
asked questions
about why we ruled
Vanessa's death a suicide.

554
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:13,003
He accept it?

555
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:16,377
I walked him through
the evidence as gently
as I could, but I screwed up.

556
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,848
I mentioned the oral sodomy.
I thought you told him.

557
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:22,045
No. I didn't want to put
that image in his head.

558
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,111
His daughter on her knees
in some filthy alley.

559

I'm sorry,
but it's in there now.

00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:39,414
He killed a sexual predator
that you said
we couldn't convict.

608
00:29:39,484 --> 00:29:41,952
I will not
condone vigilantism.

609
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:45,984
I am not going to Iet
my compassion for Ray
prevent me from doing my job.

610
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:48,651
Well, I did my job.
I arrested him.
He's all yours.

611
00:29:53,298 --> 00:29:57,894
I want manslaughter
and probation. Extreme
emotional disturbance.

612
00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:01,632
Ray snapped when he found out
his daughter's rapist would go
unpunished for his crime.

613
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:04,436
For someone who snapped,
your client was
thinking clearly enough

614
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:07,740
to obtain a weapon,
Iocate the defendant,
and execute him.

615
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:09,713
That's not
temporary insanity.

616
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:13,842
You know the EED
statute was designed
to downgrade murder charges,

617
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,945
when they are
mitigated by the defendant's
severe psychological trauma.

618
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:20,958
Only when the defendant's
mental state creates a Ioss
of self-control.

619
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:23,324
Ray's actions appear
deliberate and rational.

620
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:26,364
Don't take our word for it,
have your shrink evaluate Ray.

621
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:32,259
Perry Williams
killed my daughter.

622
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:36,967
He took her to
such a dark place that
she couldn't find a way out.

623
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:40,375
So what did you do?

624
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:42,970
Guy I know at the work site
gave me the gun.

625
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:48,578
I went to the club,
said I had an appointment
with Perry

626
00:30:49,254 --> 00:30:50,881
and waited in his office.

627
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:52,257
And what happened after that?

628
00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:55,289
Perry walked in.

629
00:30:56,396 --> 00:31:00,298
I confronted him
with Vanessa's rape.

630
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,096
He denied it, and then...

631
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:08,771
Then he said that she Iiked
what he did to her.

632
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,806
Ray, how did Perry
end up in the alley?

633
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:19,318
I took him there.

634
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,287
I forced him to his knees,
the way he forced
Vanessa to her knees.

635
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:27,350
He begged for his Iife,
he swore that he would
tell the truth to the cops.

636
00:31:28,862 --> 00:31:31,262
I said enough,
you know, enough Iies.

637
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,336
So I put the gun in his mouth,
and I pulled the trigger.

638
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,077
Ray's emotional pain
is genuine

639
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:54,177
and the cause for his mental
trauma is Iegitimate,

640
00:31:54,254 --> 00:31:55,812
but I don't buy
his affirmative defense.

641
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:58,016
Why the hell not?
This is a man who's
Iost his daughter.

642
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:01,151
Well, despite his
emotional distress,
he had the presence of mind

643
00:32:01,228 --> 00:32:03,526
to carefully
plan this murder.
He knew right from wrong.

644
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:06,430
He knew nothing.
This is a guy
drowning in grief.

645
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,992
HUANG: Ray made clear,
Iogical, and deliberate
choices.

646
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,560
He forced Perry
out into that alley

647
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,106
and symbolically re-enacted
his daughter's rape
and murder.

648
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:15,641
He didn't shoot
Perry in the chest.

649
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:20,112
No, he put the gun
in Perry's mouth,
imitating the oral sodomy.

650
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,273
I'II notify Ray's attorney
that we're gonna fight it.

651
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:26,046
She'II probably try for
jury nullification, get them
to acquit out of sympathy.

652
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,450
They should.

653
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:30,149
Look. I'm not mourning
for Perry Williams,

654
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:32,248
but I'm not rolling
over for Ray, either.

655
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,123
I need that report as
soon as you can get it.

656
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:40,828
I could've stopped him.
I should've known
what Ray was gonna do.

657
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:43,828
How?

658
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,303
I'd have done
the same thing.

659
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:46,737
No, you wouldn't.

660
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,070
Wait till
you're a parent.

661
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,238
Don't throw that
crap at me, EIIiot.
You made a mistake.

662
00:32:58,051 --> 00:32:59,541
What?

663
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,314
You Iet Ray in.

664
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,421
You're right, I did.

665
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,827
He got to me,
and now I'm responsible.

666
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,300
I don't remember
Ieaving the nightclub.

667
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,273
EMMETT: What's the next
thing you do remember?

668
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:27,607
Sitting in the park,
by the Iake.

669
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:33,352
Vanessa and I went there
since she was a Iittle girl.

670
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:39,448
She would feed the ducks her
sandwiches when she thought
I wasn't Iooking.

671
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:41,517
But you still had the gun?

672
00:33:42,462 --> 00:33:43,451
Yes.

673
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,124
What were you
going to do next?

674
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:49,697
Shoot myself,
so that I could be
with my daughter.

675
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,235
Thank you.
No further questions.

676
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:02,838
You blame Perry Williams
for your daughter's death?

677
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:06,952
Yeah, he raped Vanessa
and that's why
she killed herself.

678
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,783
CABOT: You sound very
certain of that.

679
00:34:08,855 --> 00:34:11,255
But Vanessa was
emotionally unstable,
wasn't she?

680
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:12,450
BEVINS: He made her that way.

681
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:14,551
Mr. Bevins, she was
under psychiatric care

682
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:17,153
and had been
prescribed Iithium
for a bipolar disorder.

683
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,960
Are you suggesting
that Perry Williams
was responsible for that?

684
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:24,766
He Iowered her self-esteem,
and told her not to
take her medication.

685
00:34:25,372 --> 00:34:28,341
My daughter was
happy and healthy,

686
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:30,535
before she
worked at that club.

687
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,237
As far as you knew.

688
00:34:32,312 --> 00:34:36,078
There was quite a bit
about her Iife that
Vanessa did not tell you.

689
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:38,447
Did she tell you
that she had been
sexually assaulted?

690
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,844
No.

691
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:42,912
CABOT: So her relationship
with Perry Williams

692
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,219
could have been
consensual as he claimed.

693
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:49,393
You call the deceased
a rapist, but you have
no evidence

694
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,828
other than your
personal beliefs.

695
00:34:50,897 --> 00:34:52,330
That's not true.

696
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,062
Detective Stabler told me
that Perry Williams
raped my daughter.

697
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:01,601
Thank you.
Nothing further.

698
00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:07,677
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

699
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:09,271
You're calling
me to the stand?

700
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,647
No, the Defense is.

701
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:13,948
You've just become
their star witness.

702
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:15,785
Excuse me?

703
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:20,154
EIIiot, did you tell Ray
that you knew Perry Williams
had raped Vanessa?

704
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:21,956
No.
He says you did.

705
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:25,193
I told him
Perry was a suspect.

706
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:28,496
Now they're going to
use you to justify
Ray murdering Perry.

707
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:30,502
Yeah? Well, the hell with him.
He got what he deserved.

708
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,333
Well, now it's your turn.

709
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:36,000
You gave premature information
to an unstable man.

710
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:41,042
You sure as hell
better be ready
when I cross-examine you.

711
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:49,416
Detective Stabler,
did you have a conversation

712
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:51,652
with Ray Bevins
about Perry Williams?

713
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:53,185
Yes.

714
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:55,594
Do you remember the content
of that conversation?

715
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:57,097
Not word for word, no.

716
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,895
Do you remember
telling Ray Bevins

717
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:01,435
that you believed
Perry Williams
raped his daughter?

718
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,029
I said we were
Iooking at him.

719
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:07,507
Did you say, quote,
"We're gonna get the guy."

720
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:09,535
Yes, I said that.

721
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:11,010
Who did "the guy" refer to?

722
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,571
STABLER: The killer. It didn't
necessarily mean that I was
Iooking at Perry Williams.

723
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:18,381
But it's reasonable to assume
that Ray believed
you meant Mr. Williams.

724
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:22,822
Now, did you tell Ray
that you were powerless
to arrest Mr. Williams?

725
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,791
At the time,
we didn't have
enough evidence.

726
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,351
Yes or no, Detective.

727
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:30,262
At the time of the murder
did my client believe

728
00:36:30,332 --> 00:36:33,665
you would ever be able
to arrest Mr. Williams?

729
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:36,834
No.

730
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:39,868
Thank you.

731
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:47,478
"We're gonna get the guy."

732
00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:49,608
Detective Stabler,
when you made that
remark to the defendant,

733
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:52,779
was it based on
any official determination
from the NYPD?

734
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:56,482
"Official determination"? No.

735
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:58,958
Was it based on
any forensic evidence?

736
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:02,258
Yes, we had Perry Williams'
DNA on Vanessa's body.

737
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:04,993
DNA proves that sex
took place, not rape.

738
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,159
We had her diary.

739
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:07,998
A person, Detective,
not her writings.

740
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,503
We had the rape
crisis counselor.

741
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:11,198
An eyewitness, Detective.

742
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:16,971
No.

743
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,203
So your statement
to the defendant,

744
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:24,014
that Perry Williams raped
Vanessa was based purely
on your individual opinion?

745
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:27,585
Yes.

746
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:30,023
Then why did
you say that?

747
00:37:30,092 --> 00:37:31,889
Because he needed
something to hold onto.

748
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:34,326
So your sympathy
for the defendant

749
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:37,854
Ied you to give Ray Bevins
unsubstantiated information?

750
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:41,230
Yes.

751
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:46,338
Detective Stabler,
do you condone Ray Bevins'
murder of Perry Williams?

752
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:55,273
Detective?

753
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,051
No.

754
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:06,757
It was wrong.

755
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:12,193
Nothing further.

756
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:23,039
The Iaw is supposed to provide
us with safety and justice

757
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:26,239
but the Iaw failed to get
justice for Vanessa Bevins.

758
00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:28,941
And in his time of grief,

759
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:33,977
Ray Bevins Iearned that
the man who had abused,
humiliated,

760
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:37,548
and raped his daughter
was going to walk free.

761
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:42,590
Now, if it were your daughter,

762
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:47,363
your wife, your mother,
who had been raped

763
00:38:47,436 --> 00:38:52,567
and the police were unable
to arrest their attacker,
how would you feel?

764
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:57,979
Ray Bevins suffered
every parent's nightmare.

765
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:01,882
He did what every parent
knows in their heart
they would do.

766
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:06,080
He acted from
a place of profound grief,
of overwhelming Ioss.

767
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:09,717
He did not have
control of his actions.

768
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:13,853
He tried to get
justice for his daughter
in the only way he knew how.

769
00:39:15,297 --> 00:39:17,788
And now you must make
justice for Ray Bevins,

770
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,328
and return a verdict
of not guilty.

771
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,511
Some of you may believe that
Perry Williams raped
Vanessa Bevins in that alley,

772
00:39:36,385 --> 00:39:39,081
but Perry Williams
is not on trial here.

773
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:41,920
In fact, he never got
his day in court at all.

774
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,153
So in the eyes of the Iaw,
he is innocent
until proven guilty.

775
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:50,564
Even if his guilt
had been established
beyond a reasonable doubt,

776
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:53,192
he could not
have been executed
for his crime.

777
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:56,765
Ray Bevins executed
Perry Williams.

778
00:39:57,706 --> 00:40:01,665
He shot a man,
who was on his knees,
begging for his Iife.

779
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:05,011
Now some of you may think
that he deserved to die.

780
00:40:06,548 --> 00:40:07,708
But you have to
ask yourselves

781
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:10,980
if you would execute
a man whose guilt had
not been proven.

782
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:16,355
We have all felt
the need for revenge
at some point in our Iives.

783
00:40:16,425 --> 00:40:18,893
We have all Iashed
out in pain and anger,

784
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,555
and we have all thought
that justice means
an eye for an eye.

785
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:24,360
But is that justice?

786
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:28,864
Does Perry Williams' family
now have the right
to kill Ray Bevins?

787
00:40:28,937 --> 00:40:32,429
Does Ray Bevins' family then
have the right to retaliate
against Perry Williams?

788
00:40:32,507 --> 00:40:34,236
When would it stop?

789
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,975
An eye for an eye
Ieaves the whole world blind.

790
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,151
LARSEN: Has the jury
reached its verdict?

791
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:53,854
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

792
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:55,920
Will the defendant
please rise?

793
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:04,968
LARSEN: On the count of murder
in the Second Degree,
how does the jury find?

794
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,342
We find the defendant,
Raymond Bevins,
guilty.

795
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:14,980
LARSEN: Thank you for
your service. You're excused.

796
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:35,599
Ray.

797
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:39,167
I'm sorry.

798
00:41:40,342 --> 00:41:42,276
I'm not.
