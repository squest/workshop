1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:00,064
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:04,799
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:06,033
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:08,906
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:12,606
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:14,672
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:16,945
Did she come in
with anyone?

8
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:18,919
Just the paramedic
who dropped her off.

9
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:20,852
How bad?
Passed out drunk.

10
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:22,014
We hooked her up
to the banana bag,

11
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,558
Ieft her to sleep it off
and she starts to choke
on her own vomit.

12
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,218
Is she okay?
Now.

13
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:28,922
But she started to freak
when we cut her clothes off
with the trauma shears.

14
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:30,362
Thought she was
still being raped.

15
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:31,421
How Iong has she been waiting?

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,697
Came in at midnight,
we finished the kit
around 1:30.

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,738
I'm sorry.
It's been a crazed night.

18
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:38,636
Well, she's in here.

19
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:41,937
You dumped a rape victim
in Isolation?

20
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,342
We're having
a crazy night, too.

21
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,553
Hi. Chloe, right?

22
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,982
Is it okay
if I call you Chloe?

23
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,923
I'm OIivia from
Special Victims Unit.

24
00:00:57,993 --> 00:00:59,722
I'm so sorry to have
kept you waiting.

25
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:01,956
Stupid nurse made me
sit here for these.

26
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,691
Nice Iook, huh?

27
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:08,065
So, Chloe, I know
how difficult this is,

28
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,729
but I need you to tell me
everything you remember
about your attack.

29
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:12,796
Okay?

30
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:13,932
Yeah.

31
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,170
You know, about that,
I don't know...

32
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,441
I don't know
what I was smoking.
It didn't happen.

33
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,949
I understand
that you were drinking.

34
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,383
That doesn't give anybody
the right to violate you.

35
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:26,978
Just drop it, okay?
I really just wanna go home.

36
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:28,317
Well...

37
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:32,323
How about I give you
my business card

38
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:35,261
in case you change
your mind, all right?

39
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,129
There's nothing to change.

40
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:39,997
And there's no harm
in taking it, either.

41
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,830
So it happened at a club?

42
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:48,674
I wasn't at a club.

43
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:51,337
Well, there's a stamp
on the back
of your hand. Look.

44
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:53,313
The UV Iight
makes it show up.

45
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:56,350
What part of "drop it"
don't you understand?

46
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,924
Poor girl. I was starting
a new IV on her
when she reported it.

47
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:03,980
So you believe her?

48
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,720
Yeah.
She was hysterical.

49
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:07,091
She was drunk.

50
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:10,620
Had a nasty head contusion,
consistent with an attack.

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,831
Or passing out.

52
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,300
No, it was on the top
of her head,

53
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:15,461
Iike he hit her
with something.

54
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:17,095
Or rammed her
into a wall during.

55
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:20,664
Detective,
we've got a situation
with your rape victim.

56
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,734
She got detained
at discharge,
didn't have any ID.

57
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:24,801
Well, you didn't
tell me that.

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,939
Well, she was trying
to work things out
with Nancy in billing

59
00:02:27,015 --> 00:02:28,812
when a guy comes in,
starts to harass her.

60
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:30,545
Who?
By the way she reacted,

61
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:31,745
I think it could be
her rapist.

62
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,412
Oh, my God, Nancy.

63
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,388
Someone, call security.
Are you okay?

64
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:36,515
Yeah.
What happened?

65
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,616
A guy started
to drag her out
without paying.

66
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,320
I tried to stop him
and he cold-cocked me.

67
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:41,419
Where's Chloe?

68
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:44,954
Oh, he pulled her
out the exit,
kicking and screaming.

69
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,408
Witness saw our girl
being dragged
into a silver car.

70
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,474
Could've been blue.

71
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:39,679
Make? Model?
License?

72
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:40,743
Too dark.

73
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:42,187
What do we know
about the girl?

74
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:43,849
Even Iess. The name,
number, address

75
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,654
she gave to the hospital?
AII phony.

76
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,627
How's your partner doing?
She's killing herself.

77
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:49,129
She was already OT
when she took the call.

78
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,926
She still hasn't slept.
You gotta send her home.

79
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,467
Just give me
a minute.
AII right.

80
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:55,594
You know what's
bothering me, though?

81
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,661
How did the rapist
track her down?

82
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,297
Maybe he followed
the ambulance?

83
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:01,239
MUNCH: Maybe she called him.

84
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,140
I'II dump the hospital LUDs.

85
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:04,610
STABLER: You're thinking
"acquaintance rape"?

86
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:08,012
It explains the 180.
Date rapes are more Iikely
to drop charges.

87
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,914
So she calls him,
says the cops are on the way.

88
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:12,783
He sweet-talks her,
convinces her
to Iet him pick her up.

89
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,617
STABLER: Makes sense.

90
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,748
So does a Iittle privacy.

91
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,498
OIivia,
get some sleep.

92
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,360
Not until I find this girl.

93
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,630
FIN: Security photos
from the hospital camera.

94
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,638
In all the pictures
he's got his hat pulled down,

95
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,936
dark glasses
and he knows to be camera-shy.

96
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,410
She doesn't.
She's staring right
at the camera, terrified.

97
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,845
We know where
the ambulance
picked her up?

98
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:42,246
The hospital faxed me over
the ambulance run sheet.

99
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:44,911
Driver Ieft half of it blank
including the point of origin.

100
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:47,819
Yes, another underpaid,
overworked civil servant.

101
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,323
It wasn't a city ambulance.
Private company.

102
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:51,984
FIN: Well, that's the new scam
clubs are running.

103
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,358
They're hiring private buses
to cart off the ODs.

104
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:56,021
They bypass
police involvement.

105
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:59,430
This girl had a club stamp
on her hand. An elephant.

106
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,198
Let's run it down.

107
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,006
MAN: I don't know
what else to tell you.

108
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:08,633
She was passed out
in the street.

109
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,734
MUNCH: What street?

110
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,938
Canal, in Tribeca.
That's a big street.

111
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,413
Between Church
and Varick.
Who called it in?

112
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,813
Anonymous Good Samaritan.

113
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:17,283
Good Samaritans call 911,

114
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:19,149
they don't call private
ambulance services.

115
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,279
We know you picked
her up at a club.
Her hand was stamped.

116
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:23,017
MAN: She was soused.

117
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:25,616
Probably stumbled out of one,
just can't tell you which.

118
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:27,355
You can't
or you won't?

119
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:28,418
You better search
your memory.

120
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,895
This girl was raped
and abducted.

121
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:30,953
If anything happens to her,

122
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,522
I promise
we're taking you down.

123
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,363
So, one more time,

124
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:35,801
where'd you pick her up?

125
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,667
Air Bar.

126
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,572
VERA: I comply with all codes.

127
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:45,272
Even this new,
pain-in-the-ass
no smoking ban. See?

128
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:47,144
I think the Liquor Board
might be more interested

129
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:48,910
with how many patrons
are rolled out of here

130
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,177
with acute
alcohol poisoning.

131
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:51,275
I don't know
anything about that.

132
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:52,843
Lady, you've got
your own ambulance

133
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,752
waiting for them outside.

134
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,814
I wonder how many
girls Ieave here
with GHB in them?

135
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,688
You know,
a date rape drug
isn't taken voluntarily.

136
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,159
I know clubs
have had people die

137
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:01,889
in the time it takes
to call 911.

138
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,396
That's why I go
that extra mile

139
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:04,523
to protect my clients.

140
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,533
You did a piss-poor job
of protecting this one.

141
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:09,035
Before you poured that girl
into the ambulance Iast night,

142
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:10,662
she was raped
by one of your guests.

143
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:11,763
Now a hot spot
Iike this

144
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,603
has to have
a VIP Iist, huh?

145
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:14,699
You'II need a court order.

146
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,676
Well, the girl
that you allowed
to be raped is missing,

147
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:18,042
so I don't think
we're gonna have
any trouble

148
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:20,274
getting that, do you?

149
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:22,475
Roger, get that ID
they found Iast night.

150
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,677
You knew who she was
the whole time
we were talking?

151
00:06:24,753 --> 00:06:26,812
That's obstruction, Iady.

152
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:28,446
I just put it together.

153
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,889
You just put it
together, huh?

154
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,620
Jenna Sterling, 21.

155
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:34,423
Strong resemblance.
It's not her.

156
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:35,827
It's the ID
she used to get in.

157
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,228
STABLER:
What makes you so sure?

158
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:39,027
CIeaning crew found it
in the same men's room stall

159
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,158
where she passed out.

160
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:41,600
Men's room?

161
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,135
I haven't been
to a men's room

162
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,573
since Daddy dragged us
to Hong Kong

163
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,975
and my Cantonese
was still choppy.

164
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,377
When was the Iast time
that you were at
the Air Bar, Jenna?

165
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,006
Never. But I hear
it's fabulous.

166
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,311
Yeah?

167
00:06:56,384 --> 00:06:57,851
Do you mind?

168
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,547
What is that?
Just a Iight.

169
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,257
No stamp.
STABLER: They do wash off.

170
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:06,350
Where were you
Iast night?

171
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,123
At a gallery opening
in Chelsea.

172
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,390
Can anyone vouch for that?

173
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:10,556
My parents.

174
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,430
I'm graduating from Wellesley
so we went shopping.

175
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,901
Art? That's a nice
graduation gift.

176
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,631
My gift was a co-op.

177
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,866
But we had to have
something for the walls.

178
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,966
Your daddy
is Marvin Sterling,

179
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:24,409
that real estate guy.
Is he home?

180
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,674
No. He flew to Frankfurt
this morning.

181
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:28,773
Is she a friend
of yours?

182
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,215
No. I've never
seen her before.

183
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:31,309
Really?

184
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:32,819
'Cause she got into
the Air Bar Iast night

185
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,878
using your driver's Iicense.

186
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:37,288
You found it?
STABLER: She Iost it.

187
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,849
When?
Like, a week ago,
maybe two.

188
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,795
Jenna's alibi checks out.

189
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:45,890
The gallery puts her
there until midnight.

190
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,025
Well, that was the DMV.

191
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:50,070
Jenna did apply
for a new Iicense
a week ago.

192
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,538
Which is about as Iong
as it's been since
you've slept.

193
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:54,404
Grab a few upstairs.

194
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,709
Hey, guys.
Got an interesting hit
off Air Bar's VIP Iist.

195
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,805
It seems that one
of their patrons

196
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:03,908
has a prior sex assault
charge two years ago.

197
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,111
Who?

198
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,154
Morris Brandeburg,
a.k.a. Bone Kracker.

199
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:08,519
That's a pretty
tough street name.

200
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,854
That's a stage name.
He's a rapper.

201
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,393
Now, her guy was disguised,
but he was definitely white.

202
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,430
They don't get any whiter
than "The Kracker."

203
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:19,656
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

204
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:20,962
Chill, yo.
I gotta Iay it down

205
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,332
while I'm channeling,
you know what I'm saying?

206
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:23,700
Not a single word.

207
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,329
What went down
at the Air Bar Iast night?

208
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,874
PIayers ball, baby.
Off the hizzy.

209
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,206
I was just parlaying,
kicking it, you know.

210
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:33,611
Like in the old days,
when you had sex
in the clubs?

211
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,280
There's no Iaw against that.

212
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,578
Actually, there is.

213
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:37,640
FIN: We're talking
about the time

214
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,913
you Iured
that groupie back here

215
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:41,012
and you and your manager
double-teamed her.

216
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,057
She didn't sign on for him.

217
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:46,890
The manager gets
10% of everything.
I thought she knew that.

218
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,759
Skank was
a sack-chaser

219
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,597
Iooking to hit
a Powerball, all right?

220
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,330
Which she did.

221
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,565
Ho settled,
dropped all the charges.

222
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,267
What did she want?

223
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,002
Cuz, you're skitzing, man.
I don't do J.B.

224
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,944
What made you think
she was jailbait?

225
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:08,744
Shorty she was hanging with.

226
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:09,874
Who?

227
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,550
A Iittle honey
I met at this charity ball.

228
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,180
Her family's rolling
in bank, right?

229
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:16,245
Here.

230
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,219
Jenna Sterling,
back on the radar.

231
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:21,319
This girl was in
the Air Bar Iast night?

232
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,694
No, not that tight-ass biatch.

233
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:25,824
Baby sister, Vienna.

234
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,866
We need to talk
to your sister.

235
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:31,872
Vienna's not home
from school yet.

236
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,908
STABLER:
That'd be high school?
Yeah. She's a senior.

237
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,840
Oh, well, that explains
why she swiped
your Iicense.

238
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,242
What? That doesn't
make any sense.

239
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,803
She's Vienna.
CIubs just Iet her in.

240
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:41,280
VIENNA: Jenna?

241
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:43,010
Wait till you see
what I got.

242
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,984
You bitch,
you stole my Iicense?

243
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,350
Do you know
what a hassle that was?

244
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:47,445
What are you
talking about?

245
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:48,887
Who's she?

246
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:52,017
I don't know.
You were at Air Bar
with her Iast night.

247
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,617
No, I wasn't.

248
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:54,923
Really?

249
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:56,485
What are you doing?

250
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,964
Well, the elephant
says you were.

251
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,898
And they never forget.

252
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,100
Okay, my friend
was having a bad day.

253
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,433
I wanted to show her
a good time.

254
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,666
Well, your friend
was raped.

255
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,907
Now what's
her real name?

256
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,172
Chloe Dutton.

257
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:13,212
Who were you with Iast night?

258
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:14,680
No one.

259
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,649
I wanted to dance, she didn't.

260
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:19,118
When I got off the floor,
she was gone.

261
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:20,313
I thought she went home.

262
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:21,514
STABLER: Where's that?

263
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,454
Central Park West.

264
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:24,889
She wasn't at school today,
was she?

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,017
I don't know.

266
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,288
We don't go
to the same school.

267
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,728
She's only in ninth grade.

268
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,093
How old is she?
Fifteen.

269
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,196
But she's really mature
for her age.

270
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:40,440
Our girl still MIA?

271
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:41,907
She didn't show up
for school yesterday,

272
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,876
but apparently
that's par for the course.

273
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,207
Well, they didn't even
bother to call the parents?

274
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,406
Mother's out of town
staying at some fat farm,

275
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,042
and the housekeeper said
that Chloe's staying
at her father's this week.

276
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:51,176
Her father, Phillip Dutton,

277
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,413
is across town
in merger negotiations.

278
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:54,921
His assistant's trying
to get word to him,

279
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,253
but she swears
it's the mother's week.

280
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:59,225
Let me guess,
an acrimonious divorce.

281
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,351
Is there any other kind?

282
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:01,452
Obviously neither
one of them

283
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:02,553
give a crap
about their daughter.

284
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,063
STABLER: Well, she conned him
for a free night out.

285
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:05,156
Trust me, when
they're working an angle,

286
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,393
teenagers are
very slippery.

287
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,094
Oh, so now she
deserved what she got?

288
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,193
That's not what I'm saying.

289
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,534
Look, all I'm saying is
that this girl was raped
and kidnapped,

290
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:13,506
and nobody in her family
even noticed.

291
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:16,008
Look, OIivia,
you've been at this
for three days.

292
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:17,772
If anything breaks,
we'II call. Go home.

293
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,540
SVU. Benson.

294
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,779
We'II be right there.

295
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,809
Who found her?
Patrol.

296
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:28,856
I'd say just after
she washed up on the bank.

297
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:32,084
Is this your girl?
Yeah.

298
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,818
STABLER:
What did he do to her?

299
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:35,795
No obvious wounds
or Iigatures.

300
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,730
Going by exclusion,
I'd say drowning.
Contusion to the head.

301
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,529
Might have knocked her out
before throwing her in.

302
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:41,863
No, she had
that bump yesterday.

303
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,267
It was from the rape.

304
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,998
How about the cut on her Iip?

305
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,165
That's new.

306
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,771
I was right there.

307
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:51,643
I should have had him.

308
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:55,240
No broken teeth,
no petechial hemorrhaging
of the gums.

309
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:58,575
Wait. There's something
down here.

310
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,454
Some kind of business card?

311
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:05,117
PIease tell me
this guy was stupid enough
to Ieave his name.

312
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:07,491
No. Yours.

313
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,542
After submersion
she hyperventilated,

314
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,008
aspirating water
into the Iungs

315
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,637
Ieading to pulmonary
edema and hypoxia.

316
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:26,702
STABLER: She drowned?

317
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:28,806
Yes, but the question
is where?

318
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,349
Not in the Hudson?

319
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,784
Water from there is brackish,

320
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:34,981
so I should have found
salt water in her Iungs.

321
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:36,182
I didn't.

322
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,884
Well, currents
could have carried her a ways.

323
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,051
It's fresher upstream.

324
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:40,219
Not this fresh.

325
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:41,693
I ran a diatom test

326
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:44,596
which should have found
traces of algae,
plankton, krill.

327
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,724
Nothing.
You said that she
swallowed water?

328
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:50,328
Yes. Containing chlorine,
fluoride and orthophosphates.

329
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:51,701
Tap water.

330
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:56,073
With traces of a chemical
composition consistent
with Sparkly Bowl.

331
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:00,246
The bastard shoved her face
in a toilet.

332
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:03,772
Finger impressions on the back
of her neck to support it.

333
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,047
Parents are here
to ID the body.

334
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,885
Stall them.
I'II try to clean her up.

335
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,359
Mr. and Mrs. Dutton,

336
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,554
we're very sorry
for your Ioss.

337
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,155
We're the primary detectives
on your daughter's case.

338
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,029
How the hell did this happen?

339
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:22,296
You were watching her.
You tell them.
It was your week.

340
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,395
I understand this is
a very stressful time,

341
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,700
but we need
to focus on Chloe.

342
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:27,502
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

343
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:28,599
No one I know.

344
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,007
Of course not.
You were never home.

345
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,510
I was closer to her
than you were.

346
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:35,481
The viewing is done
on closed-circuit
monitor here.

347
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,881
Are you ready?

348
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,249
Why can't we
see her in person?

349
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,355
You should wait to see her
at the funeral home.

350
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,118
It will be easier.

351
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,194
MRS. DUTTON: Oh, God.

352
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,099
Oh, God.

353
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,405
You son of a bitch.

354
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,941
How could you
Iet this happen?

355
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:12,118
We'II need to talk
to her friends.

356
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,057
WOMAN: Chloe was a Ioner.

357
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,789
Do you have any idea why?

358
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:24,263
Her parents divorced,

359
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:26,459
best friend moved away,
puberty...

360
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,297
Cut the Iock.

361
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,269
She was miserable here.

362
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,566
She petitioned
for early graduation

363
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,368
but she didn't have
the grades.

364
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:38,208
Books, gym clothes,
there's no date book
or photos or anything.

365
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,110
There's something here.
A Iittle note.

366
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,739
A secret admirer?

367
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,510
"Chloe, I've done
everything I can
to help you,

368
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:48,578
"but you've screwed me
for the Iast time.

369
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,156
"You're dead to me."
Signed B.T.

370
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:56,961
I'II check the roster.

371
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:59,022
"You're dead to me."

372
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,897
I meant it figuratively.

373
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,936
And yet, she's dead.

374
00:15:03,004 --> 00:15:04,938
Chloe and I were partners
for the science project.

375
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:07,304
It's due in two days
and I've done all the work.

376
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,708
The charts, graphs, report,
water sample collections...

377
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,541
Water?
What was the project?

378
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,104
The effects of acid rain
in the urban setting.

379
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,946
I compared rain water
from various points
throughout the city.

380
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:19,486
Including the Hudson?

381
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:21,885
You don't wanna know
its pH Ievel.

382
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:24,288
What about Manhattan
toilet water?

383
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,589
That water's been treated
so it's not relevant
to my study.

384
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,823
It's relevant
to this investigation.

385
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,023
When's the Iast time
you saw her?

386
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,122
Two days ago.

387
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,827
She promised
we'd work after school
on the oral presentation.

388
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:37,962
I waited outside
and she rides right by
in some stud's sports car.

389
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,768
FIN: Describe him, Bertram.

390
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,274
High school, of course.
Maybe college.

391
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,937
Do you remember anything
about the car,
the make, the model?

392
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,809
Cars aren't really
my thing.

393
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,815
MUNCH: And what
about numbers?

394
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:51,511
Do you remember any part
of the Iicense plate?

395
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:58,552
I-L-Four-Four-Two-D.

396
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,293
I Iive for 42 Ds.

397
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:09,504
We know it's a rental.
What can you tell us
about the renter?

398
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:12,039
Mr. and Mrs. Stark
from Oklahoma.

399
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:13,301
Checked in Monday.

400
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,105
He's in oil.
Very particular.

401
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:18,510
FIN: When's the Iast time
he called down for his car?

402
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,672
Not since Tuesday.

403
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:21,648
Are you sure
he hasn't used the car
since then?

404
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:23,685
Actually,
we wouldn't know.

405
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:26,346
Mr. Stark has chosen
not to use valet service.

406
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:28,116
Your basic pain-in-the-ass.

407
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,919
Yeah. I mean,
we try to keep
the guests happy.

408
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:31,152
So we informed Mr. Stark

409
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:32,989
that he was welcome
to get his own car.

410
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:34,756
He took his key back.

411
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,991
The first few days
I drove myself everywhere.

412
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:39,124
Really? Well, most
tourists take taxis.

413
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:40,190
You ever seen those guys?

414
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:42,065
It's Iike they're on
a suicide mission.

415
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:43,968
Zane says
there's plenty to see

416
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,870
within walking distance.

417
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,068
You make any exceptions
the Iast few days?

418
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:50,043
Hell, no.
They've been keeping
me busy

419
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:51,238
at the convention anyway.

420
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:52,541
STABLER: A shame
you're missing
the night Iife.

421
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,377
He hasn't taken you
out at all, huh?

422
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:58,818
No, not when there's clients
to wine and dine.

423
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:01,014
Well, where'd you take
these clients two nights ago?

424
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:05,150
Some supposed hot spot
where the drinks were warm
and the waitresses cold.

425
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:06,854
PIace got a name?

426
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:11,197
I'm sure it does, but damned
if I can tell you what.

427
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,325
Well, how'd you get there?

428
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:17,395
We had a few before we went,
so I can't quite recollect.

429
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:23,102
Why do they need
to Iook through our car?

430
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,236
Probably just a mix-up.

431
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:25,609
Can I get that
for you, Mr. Stark?

432
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,545
I got it, I got it.

433
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,381
Probably find
a spare tire in there.

434
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:31,578
May I?

435
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:34,878
What's that?

436
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:36,014
Hell if I know.

437
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,522
These are hospital issues
just Iike the pair
they gave Chloe.

438
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:40,788
Who in the hell is Chloe?

439
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:41,988
Sir, you're gonna have
to come with us.

440
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:44,760
For what?
You cheating son of a bitch!

441
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,266
What have you done now?

442
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:47,392
BENSON: Hold on.

443
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,329
We just had
the nicest conversation
with your wife.

444
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:53,840
Boy, once you get
that woman started.

445
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,501
What'd that cow say?

446
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:57,545
That you've got a problem
keeping it in your pants.

447
00:17:57,612 --> 00:17:59,876
BENSON: And you Iike
them young.

448
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,438
This young.
Get that out of my face!

449
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:03,006
Is this how you Iike it,
you Iittle freak?

450
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:04,712
What the hell
is going on here?

451
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:07,050
I've never seen that girl.
I'm being railroaded.

452
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:08,817
Who'd want to set up
a nice guy Iike you?

453
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,087
ZANE: You don't know how
cutthroat the oil business is.

454
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:15,188
Or maybe the ball and chain
finally went off her nut.

455
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:19,700
Well, Dora says
that you didn't come back
to the hotel Tuesday night.

456
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:23,295
AII right.
I cheat on my wife.

457
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:25,339
But where I come from,
that's not a police matter.

458
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,567
So who'd you cheat with?

459
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:28,609
I don't know her name.

460
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,705
The boys and me
went to one of them titty bars

461
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,837
that never closes.

462
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:34,438
We went straight
from there to the convention.

463
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:35,642
Ask the boys.

464
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:36,775
Oh, we will.

465
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,011
Names and numbers.

466
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:41,180
And if you're
feeling generous, DNA sample.

467
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:43,588
Hey, I donate all the time.

468
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:46,218
AB Negative.
The rarest type there is.

469
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:48,091
They call me the Tulsa gusher.

470
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:57,068
Witnesses put Stark at
Peek-a-Boobs all night.

471
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:58,401
What about 3:30
the day before

472
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:00,236
when that science geek
saw Chloe in his Jag?

473
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,332
Couldn't have been Stark.

474
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:03,468
He was too busy
putting a room full
of conventioneers

475
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:05,069
to sleep
with a Iong-ass speech.

476
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:06,375
OIivia?

477
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:08,777
Chloe's rape kit came back.

478
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,044
Stark isn't a match?

479
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:11,551
To any of them.

480
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,316
There's more
than one doer?
Try four.

481
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,048
She was gang-raped.

482
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:17,318
Okay, we know
one of our perps

483
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:19,485
got hold of Stark's Jag.
The question is how?

484
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:21,825
It was parked at a week-Iong
excuse for a bender.

485
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:23,194
A couple of drunken
fellow oil men

486
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:24,664
could have easily
Iifted the keys.

487
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,200
Do you know
how many people crammed
into that hotel

488
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:27,462
for the convention?

489
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:30,198
MUNCH: Maybe this
will help narrow it down.

490
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:33,437
I plowed through the LUDs
from the hospital.

491
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:36,443
Found an outgoing call
to a cell phone
registered to...

492
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,535
STABLER: Vienna Sterling.

493
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:40,376
Who swore that she
never talked to Chloe again
after the club.

494
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:41,710
Odd. It was
a seven-minute call.

495
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:43,341
Well, what are
all the other names?

496
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:46,216
At 3:40 a.m.,
Chloe calls Vienna
from the hospital.

497
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,949
That's Iess than an hour
before I got there.

498
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,650
At 3:47,

499
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:53,125
Vienna calls Andrew Kenworthy
who then calls
Davis Harrington at home,

500
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:54,856
then his cell,
then five more times at home

501
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,090
until he finally picks up.

502
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:56,324
Well, that sounds
pretty desperate.

503
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,457
Indeed.

504
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:01,094
Davis then calls Vienna,
who calls Seth Wolfford III.

505
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:04,333
And then they ping-pong
back and forth
throughout the day.

506
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:08,741
Sounds Iike we got
three of our four guys,
Andrew, Davis and Seth.

507
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:10,335
Pick them up.

508
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:12,937
MUNCH: Andrew Kenworthy?

509
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:14,209
Damn it!

510
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:15,773
A Iittle advice?

511
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:17,284
Keep your eye on the ball.

512
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:18,547
Who the hell are you?

513
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:21,647
Detective Tutuola.
You need to come with me.

514
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:23,021
For what?

515
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:24,992
The rape and murder
of Chloe Dutton.

516
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:26,722
Who?
Come here.

517
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:31,628
Can you believe
the attitude on her?

518
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:34,169
I mean,
the girl's a sales clerk.

519
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:37,400
Hello? A Iittle help, please.
These weigh a ton.

520
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,769
Vienna?

521
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,941
Well, there went
our Iast chance.

522
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,312
They've all Iawyered up.

523
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:49,374
Well, we still have
one unaccounted for.

524
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,817
I don't suppose
anybody gave him up?

525
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:52,353
What, and incriminate
themselves?

526
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:53,410
Not one of them talked.

527
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:54,615
Or gave up their DNA.

528
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,748
Well, they're not
going to now,

529
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:57,816
not with their
$1,000-an-hour attorneys.

530
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,485
Yeah, well,
screw their money.
Ask for a remand.

531
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:02,122
Remand?
I might have Vienna
here on obstruction,

532
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:04,166
but I don't even have enough
for an indictment on the boys.

533
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,701
What're you talking about?
We've got two of them
on the club's VIP Iist.

534
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:07,895
Well, it doesn't put them
in the men's room.

535
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,961
Three words, AIex,
"Max Factor heir."

536
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,904
These kids have the means
to flee the country.

537
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:14,943
Not without a passport,
which my client
will gladly surrender.

538
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:16,444
CABOT: Well, that's awfully
big of you, Trevor.

539
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:19,037
On the condition he be allowed
to Ieave the state, today.

540
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:20,275
For what?

541
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,681
Congressman Sayres,
maybe you've heard of him?

542
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:25,744
He's expecting me in DC
to start my internship.

543
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,948
Yes, the calling to serve
is strong in this Iad.

544
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:29,651
He'II do well there.

545
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:32,216
Here's where Seth
will be staying.

546
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,095
Arlington.

547
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:39,266
You can go.

548
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:43,927
What was that about?

549
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:45,803
STABLER: What are you doing
rolling over for Langan?

550
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,399
He has a client
headed to Virginia.

551
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:48,807
Thanks to you.

552
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:50,675
Virginia recently became
the first state

553
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,737
to allow DNA collection
upon arrest.

554
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:54,442
Conviction not required.

555
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:56,849
BIatantly violating
constitutional rights.

556
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:57,943
It will be overturned.

557
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,614
As well it should be,
but hopefully not today.

558
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,989
What are the odds
Seth commits a felony
in Virginia?

559
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:06,318
Let me make
a phone call.

560
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:10,992
SERGEANT: He's in here.

561
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,297
Your car is ready,
Mr. Wolfford.

562
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,894
FIN: Traffic's Iight
and it's a fine day
for an extradition.

563
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,700
You set me up.

564
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:21,334
I assure you,
a Iocal bank was indeed robbed
and a guard was shot.

565
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,468
It wasn't me and you know it.

566
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,570
One of the perps
was a six-foot tall
white man.

567
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,808
Makes you
a viable suspect.
That's bull.

568
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:28,509
That's racial profiling.

569
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:31,052
Sucks, don't it?
This is insane.
I'm innocent.

570
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,109
Well, maybe the bank job,

571
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:33,280
but in accordance
with the Iaw,

572
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:35,221
Arlington PD
ran your DNA

573
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,519
through the national
data bank.

574
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:39,254
And you're a dead match
for one of Chloe's rapists.

575
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:41,455
They had no right
to take my DNA.

576
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,226
Yeah, well,
write to your congressman.

577
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,466
This is preposterous.

578
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:48,935
Your friend Seth
gave him up.

579
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,234
A court order for his DNA
is on the way,

580
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:53,935
which you know
is going to match.

581
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,067
DAVIS: The sex was consensual.

582
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:56,406
ANDREA: Davis, shut up.

583
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:59,448
There is no such thing
as consensual sex
with a 15-year-old.

584
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:00,539
I didn't know.

585
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:02,811
The girl was in a bar
being served alcohol.

586
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:05,319
My client had no reason
to doubt she was 21.

587
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:07,686
You can't use
a dispositive defense.

588
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:09,384
Statutory does not
require intent.

589
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,323
Look, I had nothing to do
with the murder.

590
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:13,828
And you have no evidence
proving he did.

591
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:15,090
I have a motive.

592
00:23:15,164 --> 00:23:16,358
A rape conviction
might have tarnished

593
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:18,161
the silver spoon
he was born with.

594
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:19,462
I don't know who killed her,

595
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:22,129
but I swear to God,
it wasn't me.

596
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,339
Convince me.

597
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:29,167
Start from the beginning.

598
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:34,645
I was out with Andrew
and Seth that night.

599
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,912
It all started
when we ran into Max.

600
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:38,476
Who's Max?

601
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:39,851
He's a friend
of Andrew's.

602
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,519
He said he had
just done this girl
in the bathroom

603
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:44,149
and she was open for more.

604
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:45,716
You mean she'd passed out?

605
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:48,491
I was too drunk
to appreciate her condition.

606
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:52,056
AII I know was
she was passed out
by the time we Ieft.

607
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:55,396
Tell me more about this Max.

608
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:58,673
He's a cool guy, filthy rich.

609
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:01,209
I think his father invented
Krazy GIue or Post-Its

610
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:03,211
or something huge Iike that.

611
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,803
Where can we
find him?

612
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,644
Like I said,
he was a friend of Andrew's.

613
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,149
Ask him.

614
00:24:09,218 --> 00:24:11,982
Max Van Horn. I only met him
a few weeks ago.

615
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:13,180
Okay, so what do you
know about him?

616
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:14,279
Not much.

617
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:16,722
He Iet it drop once
that his father works
for the CIA.

618
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:17,816
I thought his father
was an inventor?

619
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:19,884
I don't know
about that.

620
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:22,192
What kind of car
does Max drive?

621
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:24,732
A black Porsche
and a silver Jag.

622
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:29,468
So, Max must have picked up
Chloe from school that day.

623
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,506
He met her a few days
before at Vienna's.

624
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:33,371
That'd be
your girlfriend Vienna?

625
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:34,466
Yeah.

626
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:39,437
So then this Max
snatched her up
from the hospital,

627
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:41,278
so you guys could kill her
to save your own asses.

628
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,409
No. I had nothing
to do with the murder.

629
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:44,510
It must have been Max.

630
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:46,020
Well, we've got
a problem here

631
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:47,385
because Vienna
didn't call Max

632
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:49,424
at 4:00 in the morning,
she called you.

633
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:51,221
To warn you
that Chloe was gonna
turn you guys in.

634
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:54,126
No, to scream at me
for cheating on her.

635
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:55,629
Cheating?

636
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:57,131
Cheating, really?
She didn't have a problem

637
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,962
with the bigger picture,
Iike the rape?

638
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:01,127
You don't know Vienna.
It's all about her.

639
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:02,727
Oh, what is it
with you people?

640
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:03,863
What is wrong with you?

641
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:06,134
Do you have a conscience?

642
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,802
You raped and killed
a Iittle girl!

643
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:10,368
I didn't kill her.

644
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:12,141
We've got panicked
phone calls

645
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:15,843
between you, Vienna,
Davis and Seth,

646
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:17,647
but not one
to good old Max.

647
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,812
He's not
in the picture, son.

648
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:20,219
Why is that?
Explain that to me.

649
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,450
Because I didn't
have to call Max.

650
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:24,220
He was crashed on my couch.

651
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:27,421
And when I told him
what V said, he booked.

652
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:29,396
Where can we find him?

653
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:34,635
BENSON: He's gotta
come home some time.

654
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:37,638
STABLER: Not if one
of his friends
tipped him off.

655
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:38,798
These are not
the kind of guys

656
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:41,536
who would go out on a Iimb
for each other.

657
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,202
You got a point.

658
00:25:44,146 --> 00:25:46,910
What do you think it is,
the money?

659
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:48,347
Not all rich kids
are Iike this.

660
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:50,009
Yeah, but these are
trust fund babies.

661
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:51,552
Everything handed to them.

662
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,781
No character,
no conscience.

663
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,057
You're either born
with a conscience
or you're not.

664
00:25:57,527 --> 00:26:00,690
Oh, no, no, no.
It's all about
how you're raised.

665
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,365
We've got someone approaching.

666
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:11,233
Max Van Horn!

667
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:12,639
Hey, Max.

668
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:17,444
It's the valet guy
from the hotel.

669
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:19,072
Son of a bitch.

670
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:23,408
Now, do you prefer
Max Van Horn

671
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:25,954
or your Iegal name,
Mitch Wilkens?

672
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:27,250
Just... Just Mitch.

673
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:28,723
Where'd you get Max?

674
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,757
I thought it sounded rich.

675
00:26:31,828 --> 00:26:35,457
You know, Iike those guests
whose bags I schlep every day.

676
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,432
I just wanted to be
one of them.

677
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,797
BENSON: So you stole
their cars?

678
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,665
I only borrowed them.

679
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:44,137
And the first time
was a couple of weeks ago,
you know?

680
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,175
I took out a Porsche,
just for a spin,

681
00:26:46,242 --> 00:26:48,574
but, there was this Iine
outside this club.

682
00:26:48,645 --> 00:26:52,843
I mean, you should have seen
the Iooks I was getting.
It was my in.

683
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:55,817
That was the night
I met Andrew and Vienna.

684
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:58,714
So what happened?

685
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:01,823
We clicked.

686
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:05,326
Even exchanged numbers.

687
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:09,393
The problem is,
I had to keep up the image.

688
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:11,491
And the best way to do that
is by raping a 15-year-old.

689
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,627
They set me up!

690
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:15,432
BENSON:
Your new best friends? Why?

691
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:18,133
I don't know.
Maybe they're rich and bored

692
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,199
and that's how they
get their kicks.

693
00:27:20,276 --> 00:27:21,937
I mean, they probably sensed
I wasn't one of them.

694
00:27:22,012 --> 00:27:23,912
STABLER:
How'd they set you up?

695
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:25,914
Andrew asked
if I would pick up

696
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:27,711
one of Vienna's friends
and we'd all go out.

697
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:29,376
Did you pick Chloe up
at school?

698
00:27:29,452 --> 00:27:31,943
I picked her up
across the street.

699
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:34,619
I mean, you saw her.
Would you think she was 15?

700
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:37,091
Maybe not, but I wouldn't
have gang raped her
in the bathroom.

701
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,391
Andrew pulled me in.
I said, "No way."

702
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:43,591
They gave me a hard time.
They called me a wuss.

703
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:47,100
They pressured me into it.
Really?

704
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,728
Because we heard
that you started the party.

705
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:50,204
It's a Iie!

706
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:56,874
But, you know, of course,
they're gonna
get away with it.

707
00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:57,970
'Cause they're rich.

708
00:27:58,048 --> 00:27:59,811
So help us out here, Mitch.

709
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:02,477
Who was with you
when you killed her?

710
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:04,948
I didn't kill her.

711
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:14,625
AII I know is
Andrew got a phone call
at, Iike, 4:00 in the morning.

712
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:16,757
You know, he said
things had turned south,

713
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,266
he needed the Jag
to take care of it.

714
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,029
So how do we know
that you didn't go with him?

715
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:24,096
Because I panicked
and I took the first bus
to my mom's in Jersey.

716
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:26,301
That's a bad story,
because we've got
a picture of you

717
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:28,276
dragging Chloe
out of the hospital.

718
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:30,278
That's not me.
There are witnesses, Mitch.

719
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:33,042
Wait...
I know this coat.

720
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:34,811
That guy... That guy, Seth.

721
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:37,182
Seth... Seth Wolfford.

722
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:43,717
Seth was the first one
to roll.

723
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:44,885
That's why he got a deal.

724
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:46,451
Do you think we gave it
to the wrong boy?

725
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:48,190
Does this Mitch
have a record?

726
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:49,288
No. CIean as a whistle.

727
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:52,061
If he's telling the truth,
you've gotta yank Seth's deal.

728
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,602
That's why
I don't Iike to make deals

729
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,797
until everyone's
done their job.

730
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:57,897
We'II check out
his story.

731
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,406
Mitch showed up
at 5:00 that morning.

732
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,778
Oh, he was so upset.

733
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:06,873
About what?

734
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,508
He said he'd made
some new friends

735
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:10,644
and that they'd gotten
him into trouble.

736
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,210
Did he tell you
what the trouble was?

737
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:14,153
Something about a car.

738
00:29:14,224 --> 00:29:16,021
He had taken one
for a joyride

739
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:17,787
thinking that he could
get it back in time,

740
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:21,661
but those boys
took advantage of him
and disappeared with it.

741
00:29:22,265 --> 00:29:26,099
Mrs. Wilkens,
did your son tell you
he was involved in a rape?

742
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:27,695
What?

743
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:30,094
Oh...

744
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,468
That can't be true.

745
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,271
BENSON: There's no question.

746
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:36,671
We have his DNA.

747
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,248
I knew
there was more.

748
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,318
You have to understand.

749
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:44,819
He tries so hard
to impress people.

750
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:47,482
He's so easily influenced.

751
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:50,856
The girl he raped
was found murdered
the next day.

752
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:53,395
Well, I know he had nothing
to do with that. He was here.

753
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:57,297
We saw him Iater that day
at the hotel, with the Jag.

754
00:29:58,368 --> 00:29:59,562
How did he get it back?

755
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:01,399
That boy drove it here.

756
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:04,065
He took Mitch in to work.
What boy?

757
00:30:04,774 --> 00:30:06,833
I think his name was Seth.

758
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:10,846
(MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO)

759
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:12,245
You know,
if you'd tell me

760
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:13,339
what you were
Iooking for,

761
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:15,850
it'd save my maid
a Iot of work.

762
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:20,215
Damn it,
this is harassment!

763
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:23,249
Give me that,
you Iow-Iife piece...

764
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:25,590
Think Iong and hard
about your next word, Seth.

765
00:30:25,662 --> 00:30:28,995
Harassing a police officer's
a sure way
to get that bail revoked.

766
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:31,625
Lookee what I found.
Oh.

767
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:33,726
Just Iike the hospital
security photos.

768
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:35,327
Oh, my God.

769
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:37,669
You're framing me again.

770
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,106
Nice shades.
Those aren't mine.

771
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:41,666
Detectives...

772
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:47,915
I got traces of blood.

773
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:53,387
Why, Seth, what pretty
blue water you have.

774
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:00,457
That was hell.

775
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,327
Seth's attorney
give you a tough time
on cross?

776
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:03,490
Langan was a cakewalk.

777
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:05,363
That media circus
was another story.

778
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:06,868
STABLER: Rich,
pretty boy defendant.

779
00:31:06,936 --> 00:31:07,925
Sells a hell
of a Iot of papers.

780
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:09,335
This kid's an idiot.

781
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:10,804
He should have taken
a plea Iike his buddies.

782
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:13,001
What he got to Iose?
He was the only one
facing murder.

783
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,941
Arrogance. He thinks
he can beat the rap.

784
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:17,502
And he still swears
he was on his daily 10-K

785
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,480
during the time
of that murder.

786
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:21,517
POLICEMAN: That's them,
over there.

787
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:24,878
BENSON: Can I help you?

788
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:26,080
Yeah.

789
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:28,487
I know who killed
Chloe Dutton.

790
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,792
Excuse me?

791
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,293
You arrested the wrong boy.

792
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,995
That's the one who did it.

793
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:37,327
That's Mitch Wilkens.

794
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,662
Yeah.

795
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:40,430
That's probably
what he calls himself now.

796
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:43,267
But his real name
is Eric Wayne Proctor.

797
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,537
And how do you
know this?

798
00:31:45,608 --> 00:31:47,235
Because he murdered my son.

799
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:50,471
Okay, maybe we should
have a seat.
Yeah.

800
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:51,604
No.

801
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:54,113
It said in there
you cut him a deal.

802
00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:56,743
That means he could get
two years this time.

803
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,946
What do you mean
"this time"?

804
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:02,147
Twelve years ago,
he Iived down the street
from us.

805
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:03,886
He and his mother.

806
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:07,022
Eric Ied my Iittle boy,
Tommy, into the woods.

807
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:09,998
Eric was 10.

808
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:13,031
My Iittle guy was only three.

809
00:32:15,605 --> 00:32:18,631
Take your time.
Why don't we have
a seat here?

810
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:28,212
Eric tortured my son.
He molested him.

811
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:31,311
He poured gasoline on him.

812
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:33,983
They said that

813
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:39,456
when he set my guy on fire,
he was still alive.

814
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:42,287
Was this Eric ever convicted?

815
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:45,630
Yeah, but not as an adult.

816
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:49,035
He went
to a juvenile facility,

817
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:51,005
for kids, and that's all
the information I got on him.

818
00:32:51,074 --> 00:32:52,905
So you haven't had
any contact with him

819
00:32:52,976 --> 00:32:54,603
since the trial
over a decade ago?

820
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:55,905
No, sir.

821
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,147
How can you be sure
that this is the same person?

822
00:33:00,216 --> 00:33:02,946
Because you never forget
the face of the monster

823
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:04,611
who killed your son.

824
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,358
STABLER: They couldn't
publish the killer's name

825
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:11,290
because of his age,
but I'm telling you,

826
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:12,453
it was the most
gruesome murder

827
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:13,586
in Bedford,
New Hampshire's history.

828
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:15,187
We talked
to the Iocal police.

829
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,629
They said that
he was always a psycho.

830
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,530
He's been collared five times
for breaking and entering.

831
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:21,297
His juvenile records
were sealed and then expunged
when he was released.

832
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:22,395
When did he get out?

833
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:23,939
BENSON: Three years ago,
when he was 19.

834
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:25,531
He was supposed to be in there
till he was 21,

835
00:33:25,608 --> 00:33:26,734
but he got out early
for good behavior.

836
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:28,037
Of course he did,
because he's a sociopath.

837
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:30,636
He gets a clean slate,
a new name
and then he moves here.

838
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:31,975
Where he kills again.

839
00:33:32,048 --> 00:33:33,208
CABOT: You're going
on a hunch.

840
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:34,840
AII you have is
his prior bad act,

841
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:36,714
which I can assure you
is not admissible in court.

842
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:37,878
AIex, I'm telling you,

843
00:33:37,954 --> 00:33:38,978
you've got the wrong kid
up for this murder.

844
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:40,716
If we've screwed up,
then fix it,

845
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,691
preferably before the end
of Seth's trial.

846
00:33:46,562 --> 00:33:48,189
BENSON: I'm sorry.
Which did you prefer?

847
00:33:48,264 --> 00:33:49,697
Was it Max or Mitch?

848
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:51,927
Or was it
Eric Wayne Proctor?

849
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,662
I think I had
the most fun as Max.

850
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:55,260
So, Eric, tell me,
you had three jerks

851
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,600
to choose from.
Why frame Seth?

852
00:33:56,672 --> 00:33:58,640
I didn't frame anybody.

853
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:02,240
But if I had,
Seth did have the most money,

854
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,643
the best Iooks,
the brightest future.

855
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:06,704
Who could resist?

856
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,512
Well, Seth denies
that the hat,

857
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:10,950
the coat and the sunglasses
are his.

858
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,378
You planted them.

859
00:34:12,455 --> 00:34:14,286
Now how could I get
into his house?

860
00:34:14,357 --> 00:34:16,791
The same way you got
into Stark's Jag.

861
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,486
You stole the key
and you made a copy.

862
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:20,222
A boy gets quite
an education in juvie.

863
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:21,854
You're right.

864
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:23,865
But I didn't do this.
Oh, you're good.

865
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,867
You got your own mother
to alibi for you

866
00:34:25,935 --> 00:34:29,063
and to tell you the truth,
we believed her.

867
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,137
She's a bigger sociopath
than you.

868
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,802
Everyone assumes
she did something awful to me.

869
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:36,071
But she didn't.
You're a Iiar.

870
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,772
She's never
abused me once.
You're a Iiar.

871
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:39,246
Not physically
or psychologically.

872
00:34:39,315 --> 00:34:40,543
You're a Iiar.

873
00:34:40,616 --> 00:34:43,210
That woman did something
terrible to you, boy.

874
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:44,548
I wish.

875
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:47,683
Poor old thing.
She got hate mail,
death threats,

876
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:50,089
people spit on her
in the street.

877
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,027
She stuck it out there
just to see me.

878
00:34:57,133 --> 00:35:00,432
Now that's Iove.
No. That's denial.

879
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:02,471
You think that your mother
can't be broken?

880
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:04,768
You think you're in
total control of her?

881
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:06,399
You just watch me.

882
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:08,273
Bring it on, bitch.

883
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:11,173
(LAUGHS)

884
00:35:14,383 --> 00:35:17,546
As I said,
there's nothing to break.

885
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:21,454
But do go easy
on the old girl.

886
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,788
I've put her
through so much already.

887
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:29,361
He ruined your Iife.

888
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:32,595
You Iost your job,
your friends, your husband.

889
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:35,398
You stood by him.
He's murdered again.

890
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,334
Only this time
he dragged you into it.

891
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:39,396
You perjured yourself,

892
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:41,568
you obstructed justice
and you could go to jail.

893
00:35:41,644 --> 00:35:44,807
I didn't Iie.
He didn't kill that girl.

894
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,075
Her name was Chloe.

895
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,946
She was only 15.

896
00:35:48,017 --> 00:35:50,508
Of course, that's five times
older than his first victim.

897
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:52,451
Eric was only
a baby then.

898
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:54,114
He didn't know
what he was doing.

899
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,784
He thought
it was a game.
A game?

900
00:35:56,859 --> 00:35:58,952
This is not a game.
Your son is sick!

901
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:01,258
No! They cured him!

902
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:03,899
Nine years
he spent in that prison.

903
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:05,900
It was a juvenile facility.

904
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:08,994
It was his entire childhood!

905
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,005
He had counseling
that whole time.

906
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:13,837
He did so well
that they Iet him out early.

907
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,377
He played them.

908
00:36:15,444 --> 00:36:18,038
He showed them
exactly what they
wanted to see,

909
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:20,639
just Iike he does with you.

910
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:22,741
Oh, you don't know him.

911
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:27,288
He's a good boy.
He's got a job.

912
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,049
He Iives in
a beautiful brownstone.

913
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:33,027
And he Ied Tommy Leggatt
into the woods to his death,

914
00:36:33,095 --> 00:36:36,587
just Iike he Ied this girl
into the men's room
to be gang raped.

915
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:38,634
But he didn't kill her.

916
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:44,228
Mrs. Wilkens,
a mother knows her son.

917
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:48,506
Now you know that that's him,

918
00:36:49,178 --> 00:36:52,705
dragging her from the hospital
to her death.

919
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:58,114
Before he dumped her body
into the river,

920
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:00,712
he shoved her face
into the toilet

921
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,781
and he held it there
until she was dead.

922
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:05,793
That's how much regard
he has for human Iife.

923
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:09,194
And when he gets out,
he's gonna kill somebody else.

924
00:37:10,566 --> 00:37:12,329
You're wrong.

925
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:14,096
He didn't do this.

926
00:37:15,204 --> 00:37:16,694
Oh, my God.

927
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:20,705
EIIiot, Iook at this.

928
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:22,908
The bracelet.

929
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,844
She was wearing it
when she was dragged
out of the hospital,

930
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:27,178
but not when she washed up.

931
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,683
He took it.

932
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:35,647
Mrs. Wilkens,
where'd you get the bracelet?

933
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:52,635
CABOT: Mrs. Wilkens,
you'II have
to speak up, please.

934
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,938
Where did you get
the bracelet?

935
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,808
MRS. WILKENS:
My son gave it to me.

936
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:57,903
CABOT: When?

937
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:02,007
It was a Friday.
It was the first week of May.

938
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:07,083
That was one day
after Chloe Dutton was killed.

939
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:11,152
Did you see your son
the day before,

940
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:13,127
the actual day of the murder?

941
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:15,523
No.

942
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:19,898
Why did you tell
Detectives Benson and Stabler
that you did?

943
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:24,167
My son asked me to.

944
00:38:26,442 --> 00:38:28,910
What exactly
did he ask you to do?

945
00:38:29,712 --> 00:38:34,172
He said that some boys
had found out about his past

946
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:38,481
and they were going to
use it against him.

947
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:41,352
He said that they
had done something bad

948
00:38:41,424 --> 00:38:45,190
and they were going to
make everyone believe
that he had done it.

949
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:48,393
Did you believe him?

950
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,133
No.

951
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,168
No.

952
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:04,641
Why not?

953
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,947
Every mother knows her son.

954
00:39:15,725 --> 00:39:18,216
That bracelet that he gave

955
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:21,662
to me,

956
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:25,326
he took off
the dead body
of Chloe Dutton.

957
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,835
I'm so sorry.

958
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:34,501
Eric should never
have been Iet out
after he killed Tommy Leggatt.

959
00:39:34,577 --> 00:39:36,135
Objection! Your Honor...

960
00:39:36,212 --> 00:39:38,874
That judge had no choice,
but you do.

961
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:41,979
He's sick.

962
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:44,611
If you ever Iet him out again,
he will kill again.

963
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:47,155
Mrs. Wilkens...
No! Listen to me!

964
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,890
There's no fixing him.

965
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:52,320
He was born bad,

966
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:55,490
and he's gonna die bad.

967
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:59,125
There's just...
There's nothing anyone can do.

LARSEN: Has the jury
reached a verdict?

969
00:40:11,747 --> 00:40:12,839
We have, Your Honor.

970
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:15,076
On the count of kidnapping,
how do you find?

971
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:18,245
We find the defendant,
Mitchell Wilkens, guilty.

972
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:23,085
On the count of murder
in the first degree
how do you find?

973
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,490
Guilty.

974
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:27,525
LARSEN: Sentencing will be
imposed June 4th.

975
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:28,961
The jury is excused.

978
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:43,908
Mitch.

979
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:48,249
This is a capital
offense, Mitch.

980
00:40:48,317 --> 00:40:50,376
Looks Iike you're
going away forever.

981
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:51,579
Don't worry. I'II write.

982
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:52,643
Well, we did a Iittle digging.

983
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:55,986
You don't own that brownstone
where you were Iiving.

984
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:58,390
You never paid rent,
you had no Iease.

985
00:40:58,461 --> 00:41:01,555
It's owned by an elderly woman
called Emily Owens.

986
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,827
No family, most of
her friends have died.

987
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,868
And we can't find her.

988
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:09,532
Eric,

989
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,229
everybody including
your own mother

990
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:15,072
believes you're beyond
redemption.

991
00:41:15,478 --> 00:41:17,139
That's not true.

992
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,080
This woman deserves
a proper burial.

993
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:22,640
You know
that's the right thing.

994
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,009
Where is she?

995
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,416
Gee, I don't know.

996
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,050
I guess I'm going away
for a while

997
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:33,651
so I should
probably give notice.

998
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,561
BAILIFF: Let's go.

999
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:39,264
Do Iet me know
if you find her.
