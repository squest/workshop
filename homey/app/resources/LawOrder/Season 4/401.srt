NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:04,732
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,806 --> 00:00:05,932
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,977
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:12,502
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,276
These are their stories.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING

00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:20,713
Is there anyone
sitting here?

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,383
Want to go somewhere
a Iittle more private?

10
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,121
Lead the way.

Police! Everybody,
stay right where you are.

Everybody remain

Hey! Hey! That means
you don't move, sir.

00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:47,146
Police! Everybody zip up
and stand against the wall.

18
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,705
Where you going,
sweetheart?

19
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:50,615
I swear, she just
brought me back here.

Yeah?

22
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:54,316
We have a warrant to
search the premises

23
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,381
and to arrest anybody engaged
in illegal activities.

24
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:58,483
That's all of you.

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,790
You gonna fine that guy?
How come you're not
arresting him, too?

26
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:02,853
What's the problem?
Says some guy attacked her.

27
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:04,023
He tried to rape me.

28
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,829
Sweetheart, when they don't
pay you, it's not rape,

29
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:08,733
it's theft of services.

30
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:11,602
Look, I'm not Iying, okay?
That guy was nuts.

31
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,607
Point him out,
and I'II haul
his ass in with yours.

32
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:16,701
He tried to rape me.
I'm not moving
until I make a report.

33
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:20,646
This is a huge mistake.
I had no idea what
kind of a club this was.

00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:31,518
AImost raped.

40
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:34,289
You know the policy.
She cries rape,
she's all yours.

41
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:35,556
Thanks, Eddie.
EDDIE: You're welcome.

42
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,858
Look, this guy
tried to attack me.

43
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:38,593
Miss Chantilly,
first things first.

44
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:41,636
Look, why don't we work
with your real name.

Lisa Perez.

46
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:45,238
Lisa Perez, me and you
are gonna have a problem

47
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:46,968
if you're making something up
to avoid charges.

48
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:49,306
He tried to strangle me.
Look.

49
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:52,037
I don't see anything

50
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:54,048
and if you weren't raped
and there's no evidence
of assault,

51
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:55,481
then there's not
a Iot we can do.

52
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,608
What do you mean
there's no evidence...

53
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:57,982
Detectives, you better
come see this.

54
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:10,221
Oh, my God.

55
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,756
That's Randy.

56
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:17,337
I told you guys.
I told you.

LISA: Why are you making me
sit through 10 Iineups?

58
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,255
Dude was gone when
the storm troopers
busted in.

59
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:13,988
I told you that 300 times.

60
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:16,762
Tell us 300 more times.
We Iove the sound
of your voice.

61
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,389
Hey, I am a victim.

62
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,956
Why are you gonna
disrespect me?

63
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:22,526
Now, Iook,
Detectives Munch
and Tutuola

64
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:25,095
are gonna get you coffee
while you wait
for the sketch artist.

65
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:27,698
That's your answer?
Coffee is your answer?

66
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:29,209
If you get something
in your mouth,

67
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:30,574
maybe you'II shut up
for five seconds.

68
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:34,479
Okay, you know what?
I want everybody's
name and badge number.

69
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,407
Hey, don't touch me
Iike that!

70
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,782
She's spunky.

71
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,377
You get an I.D.
on the victim?

72
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:41,922
Yeah, Randy Colligan,

73
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,357
a.k.a. Godiva, 23,
worked at the club
a Iittle over a year.

74
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:46,792
Two prostitution priors.

75
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:48,624
Anything conclusive
from the rape kit?

76
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:50,392
No fluids from
the preliminary.

77
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:53,161
Our guy probably used
a condom, and it Iooks
Iike she was strangled.

78
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,203
Trace evidence
at the crime scene
is gonna be a joke.

79
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,330
I don't even want to know
how many different DNA strands
are on that bathroom floor.

80
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,839
Well, this guy was ballsy.

81
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:01,773
Public place, plenty
of potential witnesses.

82
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,367
He tries to
rape one woman.

83
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:05,037
When she's too much trouble,
he just finds another.

84
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:06,910
My friends are getting killed
all over the place

85
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:08,643
and y'all are
taking a break?

86
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,241
Somebody please
find the sketch artist

87
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,183
and set her up as far away
from me as possible.

88
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:13,243
(CLEARES THROAT)

89
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,988
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You got the eyes all
messed up.

90
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,150
Miss, can you please
stop knocking my arm?

91
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:19,284
Sit down, Lisa.

92
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,386
Forget this.
You're not gonna try
to find this guy.

93
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:22,555
You don't care about me.

94
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,293
Okay, okay, the persecution
rant, it's getting really old.

95
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,891
My friends get
raped all the time.

96
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:28,230
Who's investigating that?

97
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,998
BENSON: Nobody,
if your friends don't
report the crime.

98
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,666
We get punished because
we don't act Iike society's
version of a woman.

99
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,232
We're at risk,
and nobody cares.

100
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,778
You're at risk
because you put
yourself at risk.

101
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:38,904
So do you, Detective.

102
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,140
Yes, to help
people Iike you.

103
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:43,116
Oh, no. The only people
who help us is us.

104
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:45,209
And Sister Peg.

105
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:46,948
I should've
Iistened to her.

106
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:49,684
She told us some whack job
was trying to choke girls.

107
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:52,420
The nun who hands out
clean needles to junkies?

108
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:54,359
How did Sister Peg
know about this?

109
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:56,897
I thought you were the cop
with all the answers.

110
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:59,160
That's good enough.
We done?

111
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,064
STABLER: Sister Peg?

112
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:05,766
Morning, Detectives.
Vice?

113
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,104
Special Victims. Stabler.
This is Benson.

114
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:10,303
That must go over
well with the church.

115
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:13,142
We've settled
on a "Don't ask,
don't tell" policy.

116
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:14,408
You investigating a rape?

117
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:18,441
Rape-homicide of a sex worker
at a nightclub called Onyx.

118
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,956
Did you warn Lisa Perez
about a man who was trying
to strangle prostitutes?

119
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,786
Yes.
How'd you hear about him?

120
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,291
Some of my girls.

121
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,123
I keep a bad trick Iist.

122
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:30,858
Sort of an internal memo
about johns to avoid.

123
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:33,526
"White guy goes
by Jack Psycho.

124
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,536
"BIack guy,
scar over his eye,
tried to kill me."

125
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:37,935
This is the bad trick Iist?

126
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,371
It's better than nothing.

127
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:41,306
They're traumatized.
I don't interrogate.

128
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,173
Well, do you
call the police?

129
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:46,179
My policy is no cops.
No offense.

130
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,215
None taken. This Iook Iike
the guy you heard about?

131
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,517
Well, I'II show it around,
Iet you know. Got a card?

132
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,349
Probably be better if we
talked to them ourselves.

133
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,479
I can't do that.

134
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:56,080
Well, we're not
gonna arrest them.

135
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:57,749
I believe you,
but they won't.

136
00:05:57,826 --> 00:06:00,192
I start handing them over
to police, they stop coming,

137
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:01,819
and I can't do my job.

138
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,825
What exactly
is your job?

139
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:08,801
Trying to keep them smart
and safe, Iike you.

140
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:17,938
Well, your homicide victim
was a Iong-time sex worker,
that's most evident.

141
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:20,742
Hep B, hep C, PID.

142
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,875
Twenty-three years old,
probably would've been
infertile had she Iived.

143
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:25,249
How'd she die?

144
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,118
Hanging her with the belt
was done post-mortem.

145
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:31,283
Cause of death was
strangulation, but there's
no fingerprint bruising.

146
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,792
Looks Iike he used
his forearm.

147
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:34,226
How can you tell?

148
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:37,162
Check out this
crescent-shaped
indentation on her neck.

149
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:40,690
He must wear a jacket
with a flat metal
button on the cuff.

150
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,464
Pins her against
the wall or the floor,

151
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:45,768
presses down with the forearm,
Ieaves an imprint behind.

152
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,967
Once rigor sets in,
the indentation remains.

153
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,237
MUNCH: A rapist who wears
a jacket. That ought to
narrow it down.

154
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:51,642
Best I can do for now.

155
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:53,044
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

156
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:56,049
Rape kit was negative
for fluids. No blood
under the nails,

157
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,982
found three distinct hairs
other than her own.

158
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:01,146
She's a pro. AII that
proves is she had sex.

159
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:03,520
That was the captain.
They found another body.

160
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,819
How fortuitous.

161
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:08,659
How'd you Iike to ride to
the crime scene with two
handsome members of the NYPD?

162
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,197
My Iucky day.

163
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:22,366
This is a real party zone.
Needles, pipes, condom
wrappers, empty forties.

164
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,309
Neighborhood's
a known track.

165
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,745
She was probably a pro
just doing some business.

166
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:28,544
Nobody cares
if you scream.

167
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:29,640
MELINDA: Detectives.

168
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:30,706
FIN: Got something?

169
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,810
Give me a boost, will you?

170
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:37,086
I'm Iight as a feather.

171
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:38,557
Thank you.

172
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:40,386
Is that Iipstick?

173
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:41,520
Yeah.

174
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:44,064
And a nicely
preserved thumbprint.

175
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,095
Shawn Becker.

176
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,897
Convicted of assault
and attempted rape in '94,

177
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,302
released from Attica
three weeks ago.

178
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:54,273
His PO has been out
of contact with him
for the past four days.

179
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,435
We got a radio car
sitting on his residence.

180
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,138
Didn't take him Iong
to get back in the saddle.

181
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,647
Key witness against him
was an ex-girlfriend.

182
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:02,012
She's since moved
out of state.

183
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,347
And yes, you guessed it,
she's a blonde.

184
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,546
So he's Iooking
for a surrogate
to take it out on.

185
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,885
She hung him out to dry,
and he's doing
the same thing.

186
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:10,151
You've all
gotta be so Iiteral.

187
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:13,524
While Vice is handing out
his mug to the working girls,

188
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:15,290
I want you all
to do the same.

189
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:16,489
STABLER: You know where
we're heading off to?

190
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:17,656
Sister Peg.

191
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,529
Guy is on a mission.

192
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:22,900
Maybe now she'II be willing
to break their confidence
to save their Iives.

193
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,935
Thanks, this will
be a big help.

194
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,769
And now we need yours.

195
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,900
We need to talk
to the women
who've seen him.

196
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:30,672
Can't do that.
I'm sorry.

197
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:32,337
STABLER: And you care
about these girls, huh?

198
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:35,871
In the past year
I was mugged four times,
once at knifepoint.

199
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,316
You tell me, Detective.
Do I care about them enough?

200
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:41,480
What you're doing is great,
but explain how
you're helping anybody

201
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:43,183
by preventing us
from arresting this guy.

202
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:44,816
I have to keep my word.

203
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:47,487
But when he kills five,
10, 20 more times,

204
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:48,859
what's your word
gonna mean then?

205
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,557
Just give us
a Iocation.

206
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:52,190
We don't even
need a name.

207
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,102
A few of the girls used
to work out of a hotel
on 37th and 10th.

208
00:08:58,172 --> 00:08:59,196
They don't anymore.

209
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:02,675
They said a guy
hanging out around there
was getting rough with them.

210
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:07,672
MAN: Police?
STABLER: Yeah.

211
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:09,714
That was quick.
I just called you guys.

212
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,513
Why?
Somebody heard
a gun go off.

213
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:12,883
Room 502.

214
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:14,922
Have you seen him?
That's him,
that's the guy.

215
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,286
Had a Iady with him.

216
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:17,949
Shots fired,
detectives on scene,

217
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:20,859
send units to 515
West 37th Street.

218
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:23,262
NYPD, open up!

219
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:24,889
WOMAN: I shot him.

220
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:26,961
Ma'am, drop the gun now!

221
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:28,929
Put down the gun!

222
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:31,193
(SOBS)

223
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,405
Shawn Becker.

224
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:44,816
He's dead.

225
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:48,520
Couldn't happen
to a nicer guy.

226
00:09:55,363 --> 00:09:57,888
I didn't intend to kill him.
I just wanted him to stop.

227
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:01,231
The guy was scum,
so don't worry about that.
Okay?

228
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:04,032
Thank you for helping me.

229
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,369
Can you tell us
what happened?

230
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,470
Look, we know that this guy
was targeting prostitutes.

231
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:13,343
So we're not here
to jam you up for that.

232
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:15,705
(SIGHS)

233
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:20,246
Well, I was working
in the bar next
to the hotel,

234
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,289
and he came in,
and he sat down
next to me.

235
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,525
But to tell you the truth,

236
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:28,756
I had warning bells going off
the minute that he sat down.

237
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:30,863
But I needed the money.

238
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:34,500
Well, guess I was
asking for this, right?

239
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,403
Nobody asks to get raped.

240
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:39,736
You don't have to
patronize me, Detective.

241
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,832
I mean, I appreciate
the support and everything,

242
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:43,537
but I know the risks.

243
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:45,511
Occupational hazard, right?

244
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:48,505
Debra, what happened
when you got up
to that hotel room?

245
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:53,645
Well, I told him that
we needed to settle up
before we got started

246
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,355
and then he just hit me.

247
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,782
Like that was
his plan all along.

248
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:02,696
And he kept hitting me.

249
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,128
And then he threw me
on the bed,

250
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:07,790
and he raped me.

251
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,397
And then he pulled out a gun.

252
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:11,631
And what did you do?

253
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:14,140
I just kept fighting.

254
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,235
And then he dropped the gun,
and I picked it up

255
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:21,077
and I just pulled
the trigger three times.

256
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:26,180
And then the cavalry arrived.

257
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:28,548
You are very Iucky.

258
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:30,215
I know. I know that.

259
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,454
So then you probably know
that you might not be so
Iucky next time, right?

260
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:37,898
Isn't this the part where you
try to convince the seasoned
hooker to mend her ways

261
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,900
and become a contributing
member of society?

262
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,833
My card.

263
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:47,839
On the back is a number
for victims' services.

264
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,277
Thank you.

265
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,840
Everything confirms
self-defense.

266
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:59,375
Guy beat the crap out of her
so hard the hospital admitted
her with a concussion.

267
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:01,649
The tearing and the contusions
from Debra's rape kit

268
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:03,020
are consistent
with sexual assault.

269
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,389
We know for a fact
that Becker was a rapist
and a killer.

270
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,725
So as far as we're concerned,
killing him was
a public service.

271
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,457
I'm inclined to agree.

272
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:11,896
Anything else?

273
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,797
CRAGEN: Just tying up
Ioose ends.

274
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:16,302
Nothing came up
when we ran her name
through the system.

275
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,565
Munch and Fin are running
the ballistics on the gun.

276
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,971
I'II make my recommendation
not to press charges.

277
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,509
Nice work.

278
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,773
STALEY: Well, you know the gun
you gave me off

279
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,647
your rapist-homicide
has another body on it.

280
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:31,980
MUNCH: What body?

281
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:33,782
Unsolved homicide
from Iast December.

282
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:34,879
Are you sure?

283
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:36,856
Firing pin impressions
and breech face marks

284
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:40,087
on the slugs
are exact matches
in both homicides.

285
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:44,325
This gotta be an unregistered
H&K P7 M8 auto.

286
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,162
Expensive.
Probably a dealer gun.

287
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:50,267
Any prints on
the unfired bullets?

288
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:52,101
Magazine was empty.

289
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,970
Captain, we may have
a small problem.

290
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,033
Problem? What problem?
This is a good thing.

291
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:00,012
Now we know your dead guy
capped somebody else about
six months ago.

292
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:02,174
Our dead guy was in
Attica six months ago.

293
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,812
Previous victim
was Leonard Graves.

294
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,379
Had quite a nice rap sheet.

295
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:12,620
Possession with
intent to distribute,
carrying a concealed weapon.

296
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,490
Three shots to
the head and robbed,

297
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:16,291
22 ruled it
a drug-related homicide.

298
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:19,162
Aside from the gun, there's no
immediate connection between
Becker and Graves.

299
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,258
Well, maybe there is none.
Dealer guns get
passed around.

300
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,304
Graves had it first,
got shot by his own piece.

301
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:26,067
Becker bought it off
the street six months Iater.

302
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,870
And he gets
killed with it, too?
That's a big coincidence.

303
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:31,741
You know the statistics
on people killed by their
own weapon?

304
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:34,611
Look, this gun could've been
making the rounds for years,

305
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,310
and I'm not all that
interested in chasing
after it.

306
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,853
Now, what is
the straight-Iine
explanation here?

307
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,651
Debra Weldon owned the gun
all along, and she killed
the both of them.

308
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,157
Why do we think
it was Becker's gun
in the first place?

309
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,454
'Cause that's
what she told us.

310
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:47,892
And she's the one
who shot him.

311
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:50,021
Guys, we have
a big problem.

312
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:52,156
Debra Weldon was
raped by Becker.

313
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,962
She didn't make that up.

314
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,663
AII right,
then Iet's concentrate on
who killed Leonard Graves.

315
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:59,331
I want a fresh Iook
at that case
with our new theory.

316
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:01,671
We're not gonna get
it from Debra Weldon
or whatever her name is.

317
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:02,800
Why not?

318
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:05,209
Hospital says our hooker
took off minutes after
talking to the police.

319
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,440
Fake name,
fake address,
fake social.

320
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:09,779
The fake name's no surprise.
It's typical pro behavior.

321
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,582
It's also the behavior
of somebody with something
to hide.

322
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,248
OIivia, EIIiot,
get on homicide at the 22.

323
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:18,849
Find out who Iooked good
for the Graves murder.

324
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,157
John, Fin,
check with cab companies,
dump the E.R. phones,

325
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,095
and find our
mystery hooker.

326
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,666
Graves was just a bad guy.

327
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,326
PIenty of reasons
someone would
want to kill him.

328
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:29,460
What's this
credit card statement?

329
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,198
It came about
a month after
he kicked.

330
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:35,265
We pulled the receipts,
every one of them
signed Mrs. Leonard Graves.

331
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:36,867
There is no
Mrs. Leonard Graves.

332
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,742
Only description we got
from the merchants,
she was a blonde.

333
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:40,872
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
She was smart.

334
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,074
Only kept it
a couple of days,

335
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,912
didn't charge up enough
to alert the credit card
company.

336
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,850
She's running all over town
with this credit card,

337
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,717
no one once
asks for I.D.?

338
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,915
You gave me your credit card
to buy Kathy's birthday
present,

339
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,788
nobody asked me for I.D.

340
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:53,349
It's 'cause you
Iook Iike a cop.

341
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:54,655
What'd she spend
the money on?

342
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,253
I do not Iook
Iike a cop.

343
00:14:57,798 --> 00:15:01,495
40 bucks on groceries,
15 bucks at the nail salon...

344
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:05,403
Make-up counter at Saks,
$150 at the Porter Hotel,
Midtown.

345
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:07,168
Treating herself.

346
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,467
And somebody else.

347
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:12,512
Biggest expenditure,
$400 at FAO Schwarz.

348
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:20,278
MUNCH: Mrs. Kerber, we traced
a call from Mercy Hospital

349
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:23,551
to your residence
at 3:25 this morning.
Did you take that call?

350
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:25,387
Yes, from Maggie.

351
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,723
She was mugged,
is that what you're
investigating?

352
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,160
How'd you know Maggie?

353
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,357
Oh, I baby-sit
her son, nights.

354
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:32,660
Is this her?

355
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,701
Oh, yes.

356
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,237
Isn't it awful how
that man beat her?

357
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:38,567
What'd she
call you about?

358
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,664
Well, she wanted
to pick up Joey early.

359
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:43,869
Came over about
5:00 this morning,
paid me, and they Ieft.

360
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:45,003
Where to?

361
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,740
Oh, they're going
on a Iittle vacation.

362
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,281
You know,
Maggie's always
doing that.

363
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,442
She's such
a wonderful mother.

364
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:52,880
Full name's
Margaret Peterson.

365
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:55,582
We got her address,
but Iike we expected,
nobody home.

366
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,921
Mrs. Kerber actually believes
that Maggie works nights
in a diner.

367
00:15:57,993 --> 00:16:00,928
What diner waitress can afford
$100 a night for a babysitter?

368
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,861
Did a Iittle
research on VICAP.

369
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:06,992
Looked at murders in known
prostitute areas where
a credit card was stolen.

370
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:08,434
From those we pulled
only the cases

371
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:11,870
whose charges
included hotel rooms
and children's items.

372
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,703
STABLER: Philip Malakowski
in Manhattan,

373
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,141
Michael O'Connell
in Queens,

374
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,509
John Donatov, Brad Horton
in New Jersey.

375
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,445
AII of them
unsolved homicides.

376
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,710
We can pin all of these
on Maggie Peterson?

377
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:23,910
That's what
it's Iooking Iike.

378
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:25,613
One self-defense
murder I can buy.

379
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,279
But six of them?

380
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:29,324
This Iady's
a serial killer, Captain.

381
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:34,095
Three of these victims
fall under our jurisdiction.

382
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:36,858
Becker, Graves
and Malakowski.

383
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:39,230
But it Iooks Iike we've got
a bigger picture to consider,

384
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,563
so Iet's hear
about everybody.

385
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:43,331
Well, other than the credit
card purchases, there's not
much of a pattern.

386
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,737
Both Becker and Graves
did time.

387
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:48,674
Donatov had a soliciting
collar in Jersey four years
ago.

388
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:49,802
The other three were clean.

389
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,243
Cause of death varies.

390
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:52,905
Two were bludgeoned,
one was stabbed,

391
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:55,245
one had his throat slit,
the Iast two were shot.

392
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:58,115
Now, most serial killers
use one method.

393
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,019
She's either using weapons
of opportunity or trying
to throw us off her trail.

394
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,252
I'm not entirely comfortable
Iabeling the suspect a serial
killer.

395
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:06,794
Well, how many guys
she got to whack
to make you comfortable?

396
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:09,023
I'm just not sure
that she fits
the typical profile.

397
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:11,793
There is no profile
for the female serial killer.

398
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:15,132
The FBI studied 36 guys,
Iike, 20 years ago.

399
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:18,434
Historians now believe
that many unsolved murders
were committed by women

400
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:21,408
who got away with it simply
because no one thought
a girl could kill.

401
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,603
Maggie Peterson certainly
is a multiple killer,

402
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,646
but there's one fact
that nobody's mentioning.

403
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:27,107
She was raped.

404
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:29,742
Her actions could be
the product of pronounced
rape trauma syndrome.

405
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:32,343
What, you're saying
she has a flashback
and cuts a guy's throat?

406
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,820
It could be more
about a trigger.

407
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:37,120
The guy does something
that reminds her
of a past assault,

408
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:40,389
and it provokes
the same feelings of fear,
anger, helplessness...

409
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:42,191
So whether or not the guy's
going to attack her,

410
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:44,562
she thinks
that she's in danger,
and she fights back.

411
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,158
Then goes on
a shopping spree. No.

412
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:48,964
She's celebrating
her kills.

413
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:50,766
AII right, these are
all great theories,

414
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,204
but we know nothing
until we find her.

415
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,673
So Iet's follow the money.

416
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:55,573
Shawn Becker was
her Iast victim.

417
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:57,077
Did he have any cards?

418
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,613
No one's given
a recent con a Visa.
We checked.

419
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,376
Which means
sooner or Iater

420
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,645
she's got to find herself
another source of income.

421
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:11,487
Special Victims.
We took the call
about your homicide.

422
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,427
Well, we got a victim,
but he ain't that special.

423
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:18,455
Got a report about somebody
bleeding all over the inside
of his Seville.

424
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,798
Appearance paints a nice
picture of how it went down.

425
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,397
Pants undone.
Rolled by a pro.

426
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,334
She rolled him good, too.

427
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:31,803
Looks Iike about
six stab wounds.

428
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:37,911
No cash.
Lots of credit cards.

429
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,544
We know she only
Iikes to take one.

430
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,920
Name's Vincent Bertram,
Iived on West End.

431
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:46,119
We get his credit report,
find out which one's missing.

432
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:49,891
Hope Maggie's in the mood
for another hotel getaway.

433
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,126
Vincent Bertram's
credit report.

434
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,634
The guy was carrying
more debt than all of
our salaries combined.

435
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:57,069
Spends all his cash
getting service in his car.

436
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,004
Now, it says that he owns
five credit cards.

437
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,065
We only found four
in his wallet, right?

438
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:03,304
Here. American Express
is missing.

439
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,869
That's a wise choice.
You get frequent
flyer miles with that.

440
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:07,471
What did the M.E.
have to say?

441
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:11,110
The cause of death
was between two
and four hours ago.

442
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:12,653
Pre-release.

443
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:13,813
Is that significant?

444
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,413
No. That's just cold.

445
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,291
30 minutes ago,
$400 charge on the Amex
to the Lancaster Hotel.

446
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:22,592
Go on. I'II tell ESU
to meet you there.

447
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:26,226
STABLER: Margaret Peterson!
Police! Get your
hands up. Get them up.

448
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:27,825
COP 1:
Stay right there, ma'am.
COP 2: AII right, clear.

449
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:29,336
COP 3: Put the baby down.

450
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:30,837
No. No guns, please.
No guns.

451
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:32,372
(BABY CRYING)
Okay? Okay.
You're scaring him.

452
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,839
BENSON: Hand him over to me,
nice and easy.

453
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:34,933
I'm not
gonna do it.

454
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,910
Maggie, no one will get hurt
if you hand him over.

455
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:38,502
Hand him
over to me, Maggie.

456
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,414
No, no. Don't hurt him!
Don't hurt him!

457
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:45,976
Maggie Peterson,
you're under arrest for
the murder of Vincent Bertram.

458
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,146
Joey! Joey!

459
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:48,450
You have the right
to remain silent,

460
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,852
anything you do
or say can be held...

461
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,452
BENSON: Where's ACS?

462
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:55,860
They can't pick the kid up
for a couple of hours.

463
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:56,193
She keeps asking for him.

464
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,733
Might make her
more amenable to
a confession.

465
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:00,330
Let's find out.

466
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:02,234
Could I make
a suggestion?

467
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:04,102
I'd just Iike to
speak with her first.

468
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,265
Why?

469
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:06,706
To do a mental
status exam.

470
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:08,107
Just do it
afterwards.

471
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:10,111
If she thinks
we're concerned about
her mental state,

472
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:11,578
we Iose an advantage.

473
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,705
We want her scared.

474
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:13,908
I disagree.

475
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,047
Who knows how
traumatized she is.

476
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:17,847
If she feels Iike
she's being ganged up on,

477
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,581
then she could just
shut down completely.

478
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:20,917
I'II just do
a brief exam

479
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,857
and then the two of you'II be
better equipped to question
her once I'm done.

480
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:26,827
This is new territory
for everybody.
I agree with the doc.

481
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:29,729
Do the recon,
Iet us know
where she's at.

482
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:33,094
Let's talk a Iittle
about your relationships.

483
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:34,864
Did you get along
with your parents?

484
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:37,905
No. No, I didn't.

485
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:41,173
Either of them?

486
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:42,677
My mother died
when I was six,

487
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:45,805
and my father was
not a very nice man.

488
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:48,349
How so?

489
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,916
He was abusive.

490
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:54,321
After my mother...

491
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,516
He started drinking.

492
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,389
When he drank,
he got violent.

493
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,457
Have you ever had
hallucinations?

494
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:05,329
Saw things that weren't
there or heard voices?

495
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,301
No, nothing Iike that.

496
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,930
Have you ever felt
someone was out to get you?

497
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:12,236
No. Well, yes,

498
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:14,332
but then again,
I was right about that,
wasn't I?

499
00:21:18,214 --> 00:21:21,775
Have you ever felt that
someone could put thoughts
into your head

500
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:23,512
or take away
your own thoughts?

501
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:28,383
God, do people
really think that?

502
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:31,291
No, I've never
felt that way.

503
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:35,962
Have you ever experienced
a situation in which you
found yourself

504
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:38,432
in another place
and you couldn't remember
how you got there?

505
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,468
Yes, often.

506
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:49,868
How did you know that?

507
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:51,503
When have you
experienced this?

508
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:58,248
When I go with these men.

509
00:21:59,555 --> 00:22:00,817
I'II be in a...

510
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,086
A hotel room or someplace

511
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:08,820
and, I don't know,
I just blank out,

512
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:15,100
and the next thing I know,
I'm on the street,
walking home.

513
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:17,799
Can you remember the first
time that you blacked out?

514
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:21,601
Yeah. I was a kid.

515
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:25,544
That's what I'd do
when my dad would
start hitting me.

516
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,148
I'd just float away

517
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:33,651
and pretend
I wasn't there.

518
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:41,029
I never thought
about this before.

519
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:45,223
About what?

520
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:48,493
How I keep doing it.
How I...

521
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:50,296
I meet these men,
and I Iet them hurt me.

522
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:52,068
And then I...

523
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,037
Keep coming back
for more.

524
00:22:58,814 --> 00:22:59,838
(SIGHS)

525
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:01,678
Why do I do that?

526
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:07,479
So what's your diagnosis?

527
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:09,421
She's not psychotic.

528
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:13,258
But she does seem
to suffer from PTSD
and dissociative episodes.

529
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:15,354
So you're still thinking
it's a rape trauma?

530
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:17,388
No. She's Iying.

531
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:19,058
She's just telling me
what I want to hear.

532
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:20,861
Why don't you
go in next.

533
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:21,925
AIone?

534
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:23,995
I need to see her interacting
with one other person,

535
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:25,870
not being interrogated
by both of you.

536
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:28,102
Keep her talking.
Just Iet her direct
the conversation.

537
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:31,075
And give her
just enough rope
to hang herself.

538
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:34,977
(SIGHS)

539
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,784
So did Dr. Huang
tell you about me?

540
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:42,824
STABLER:
He says you act Iike
you've been traumatized.

541
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:47,857
You disagree?

542
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:49,623
Yeah.

543
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,195
Well, what about your rape?

544
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:55,396
It happened.
I can't change that.

545
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:57,437
You're a cop.

546
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,804
Don't things happen to you
that other people
might find traumatic?

547
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,899
I guess.

548
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,841
So you deal with it
and you move on.

549
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:04,209
Like me.

550
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:09,914
You know, Maggie,
there are an awful Iot of
dead bodies connected to you.

551
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:11,009
I heard.

552
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,748
You cut out of the hospital,
you give everybody
a false name.

553
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:16,348
Well, I thought you guys
were gonna arrest me
for hooking.

554
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:21,520
Let's talk about
Vincent Bertram.

555
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:23,559
How'd that happen?

556
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:27,101
You really want
to talk about that?

557
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:32,300
Or maybe you're more
interested in all the moments
Ieading right up to it.

558
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:34,842
So you get in his car.

559
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,902
You get paid. You go to work,
and you stab him to death.

560
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,608
Am I...
What am I missing here?

561
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:43,345
Do we really have to
talk about this? Really?

562
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:47,949
It is getting warm in here.

563
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:51,250
What do you want
to talk about?

564
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,852
Whatever you
wanna talk about.

565
00:24:55,931 --> 00:25:00,265
AIthough guys Iike you,
you don't usually Iike
me to talk.

566
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:02,529
Guys Iike me?

567
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:05,506
I am a professional,
Detective Stabler.

568
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,770
I know men.

569

(GIGGLES)

570
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:10,434
Why don't you sit
back down over there.

571
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:12,879
But you...

572
00:25:12,948 --> 00:25:14,939
You're different
from most of the others.

573
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:17,281
Am I now?
And how am I different?

574
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:20,720
Well, you try to be
nice and normal.

575
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:24,225
But there's a part of you
that will never be that guy.

576
00:25:25,361 --> 00:25:27,192
I mean, Iook at your body.

577
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:29,060
Who are you
trying to impress?

578
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,157
Maybe my wife.
Oh, no.

579
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:36,727
No. That entire package
is for everyone else.

580
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:40,398
You're a tease,
Detective Stabler.

581
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:46,144
Everything about you says,
"Look at me,
Iook at what you can't have."

582
00:25:46,949 --> 00:25:48,507
Well, I... I Iike that.

583
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:51,718
I aspire to that.

584
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:54,119
You should Iisten to yourself.
You sound just Iike a shrink.

585
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:57,389
Like I said, I know men.

586
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,893
So you must enjoy your job.

587
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:00,520
I'm good at it.

588
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:02,121
You're not afraid
of getting hurt?

589
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:06,032
You walk around afraid,
you're never gonna
get what you want.

590
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:13,801
I'm not afraid, Detective.

591
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:16,743
Are you?

592
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:24,784
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

593
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:36,927
Wow!

594
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,730
Thought we'd call you out
of there before she took
all her clothes off.

595
00:26:39,803 --> 00:26:42,237
What is she playing at,
some kind of multiple
personality defense?

596
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:45,331
Well, not quite.
It's called
a cocktail personality.

597
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:47,569
She senses other
people's vulnerabilities,

598
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:49,407
she reads their personalities

599
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:51,242
and then she performs
accordingly.

600
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:53,214
It's the classic
sign of a sociopath.

601
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:57,276
So she reads my personality
and decides to seduce me?

602
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:00,517
Well, for her, it's all about
how to best manipulate
the situation.

603
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,356
You're the virile cop,
and so she's trying to appeal
to your physical nature.

604
00:27:04,427 --> 00:27:06,395
I'm the good doctor

605
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:08,795
and so she's trying
to appeal to my desire
to help her.

606
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,457
But she was raped.

607
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,728
Are you saying
she manipulated
that situation?

608
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:15,566
In a sense. She might be
targeting these violent men

609
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:17,664
in order to make herself
the sympathetic victim.

610
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:19,208
But she never
feels Iike the victim

611
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:21,573
because she always feels
Iike she can
control every man.

612
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:23,613
So Iet's take away
her control.

613
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,977
You're right.

614
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:28,379
And the best way to do that
is by exposing her Iies.

615
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:30,776
That way, she'II have
nowhere to hide.

616
00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:32,321
Tell her what we know.

617
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:45,223
Sit down on the chair,
Maggie.

618
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,295
Where's EIIiot?

619
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,666
Just us girls now.

620
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,432
Sit!

621
00:27:59,783 --> 00:28:02,479
That act of yours
was a whole Iot
of fun to watch,

622
00:28:02,552 --> 00:28:04,679
but you should know
that it's not gonna
work with me.

623
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,351
What act?

624
00:28:08,024 --> 00:28:09,286
You can pretend
to be a victim,

625
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,553
you can pretend
to be a whore,

626
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:13,687
you can pretend to be
whatever it is you
want to be.

627
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:16,095
It's a joke.
Maggie, you're done.

628
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,360
Where's my son?

629
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:19,994
No. See, that's not
gonna work either.

630
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,965
I do not believe
that you are
talking to me this way.

631
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,099
I was raped.
More times than
I can remember.

632
00:28:26,176 --> 00:28:28,838
Right. And your mom died,
and your dad beat you.

633
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:32,472
Your mom's alive.

634
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,746
No dad on the birth
certificate. You never
knew him, did you?

635
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:37,753
Was your mom a pro, too?

636
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:40,255
Where's my son?
I need to see him.

637
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:41,620
Your son?

638
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:44,820
You're never gonna
see that kid again.

639
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:47,556
You murdered seven men
for a hotel room
and a manicure.

640
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,598
They raped me!

641
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,964
You want the whole world
to think that you're a victim?

642
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,631
Well, Maggie,
you're getting your wish,

643
00:28:57,707 --> 00:28:59,868
because the state's
gonna kill you.

644
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:03,205
(SHOUTS)

645
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:07,076
Don't touch me.

646
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,139
(GRUNTING)

647
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:13,785
Maggie Peterson's DNA
was found in trace evidence

648
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:16,792
in both the Malakowski
and Bertram murders.

649
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,260
We also exhumed
the remains of
Leonard Graves.

650
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,921
Got a match
on two hairs.

651
00:29:20,997 --> 00:29:22,988
Well, it sounds Iike
a tight case.

652
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:25,967
But I'm guessing
you didn't ask
me here to brag.

653
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:28,868
I'm making my recommendation
to the capital committee.

654
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,370
Seeking the death penalty
against a woman for the first
time in New York State.

655
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:36,002
That ought to get
some headlines.

656
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,239
Well, just based
on the evidence,

657
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:39,577
it is clear to me
that this is
a death penalty case.

658
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:41,674
And you want
my blessing?

659
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:44,851
You know my position
on capital punishment, AIex.

660
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:47,822
George,
you evaluated her.

661
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,822
I want your opinion
as a psychiatrist.

662
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:54,125
Do you honestly believe
that all these men raped her,

663
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:56,392
and each murder
was in self-defense?

664
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,727
No, I don't.

665
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:00,599
Do you think she is
Iegally insane?

666
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,468
She may have any number
of psychiatric disorders,

667
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:07,607
but she knew what
she was doing was wrong.
She just didn't care.

668
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:09,975
And if given the chance,
will she kill again?

669
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:12,313
In a second.

670
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:15,044
She is a calculating predator.

671
00:30:16,686 --> 00:30:18,017
I Iove a good fight.

672
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:20,681
I can't believe that turned
into a women's rights debate.

673
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:23,385
We don't have the right
to execute a woman just
because she's a woman?

674
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:26,394
The majority of the Capital
Committee agreed with your
recommendation.

675
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:29,488
We get Lewin to sign it,
we make the world
a safer place.

676
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,431
And you're Iabeled
the enemy of feminism.

677
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:33,128
Hey, as far as
I'm concerned,

678
00:30:33,203 --> 00:30:35,899
this is a coup for women's
rights everywhere.

679
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:37,872
Maggie Peterson has the right
to a needle in the arm

680
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:40,068
just Iike any other
cold-blooded killer.

681
00:30:40,143 --> 00:30:42,111
So she should just
take it Iike a man.

682
00:30:44,347 --> 00:30:46,713
Gender has nothing
to do with it.

683
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:50,082
The fact that she murdered
four people in this
jurisdiction alone does.

684
00:30:50,153 --> 00:30:52,348
But she's only
charged with three.

685
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:55,288
Yeah. The fourth was
ruled self-defense

686
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:57,485
against a known
rapist and murderer.

687
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,822
I have a real
problem with this.

688
00:30:58,895 --> 00:31:01,887
That one incident does not
change the circumstances
of the other murders.

689
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:05,025
Do you think
that the first woman
New York State executes

690
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:08,002
should be a single mother,
prostitute, rape victim?

691
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:09,834
Serial killer.

692
00:31:09,906 --> 00:31:12,033
She knew those guys
were violent.
That's why she chose them.

693
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:13,735
To feel morally justified.

694
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,241
You're saying
she asked for it.

695
00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:20,373
Being the victim of a violent
crime does not mitigate
capital punishment.

696
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,112
Neither does being a woman
or being a mother.

697
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:26,155
If this was a man
we were talking about,
who was abused as a child

698
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:28,452
and then murdered
four women,

699
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:30,515
would we even be
having this discussion?

700
00:31:30,593 --> 00:31:32,356
If you were seeking
the death penalty?

701
00:31:32,662 --> 00:31:33,651
Of course we would.

702
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,695
I don't think so, Nora.

703
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:38,825
Because executing a man
wouldn't offend
the female constituents

704
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:41,097
who put you in office.

705
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,333
Whom we choose
to execute is always
a political decision.

706
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:48,004
But I'm not
gonna kill anyone,
male or female,

707
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:51,069
if there's a possibility
that they acted
in self-defense.

708
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:53,642
You don't Iike it,

709
00:31:54,684 --> 00:31:56,549
you can always run
against me next term.

710
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,184
Dr. Erica OIsen.

711
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:08,059
I'm the chief
of emergency services
at St. Andrew's.

712
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:13,493
This is a medical chart you
completed after treating
Maggie Peterson in the E.R.

713
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:14,900
Defense one.

714
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:16,802
Will you read the first
highlighted portion?

715
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:20,672
"Fractured cheekbone,
facial Iacs,
multiple contusions."

716
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:24,877
And please read
the highlighted portion
of your physician's notes.

717
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:29,114
"Bilateral bruising,
injuries consistent
with an assault.

718
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:30,652
"Patient refused
police notification."

719
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,017
Objection.

720
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:34,556
Why are we hearing
about the defendant's
medical history?

721
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:37,125
I'd Iike to know that,
too, Miss Greer.

722
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:40,120
What is the date on
that chart, Dr. OIsen?

723
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:42,255
March 12, 2000.

724
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:47,399
Defense directs the court's
attention to People's four,
already in evidence,

725
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,371
the document which
clearly establishes
the discovery

726
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,409
of Mr. Philip Malakowski's
body by police,

727
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:55,807
also dated
March 12, 2000.

728
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:57,673
So now we know.

729
00:32:57,847 --> 00:32:59,906
Your objection's overruled,
Miss Cabot.

730
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:04,884
I wasn't surprised
when the police told me

731
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:06,979
Vincent may have been
killed by a prostitute.

732
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:11,220
That was somewhat
of a hobby for him.

733
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,559
GREER:
It didn't bother you?

734
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:16,189
If it meant he'd
stay away from me?
Honestly, no.

735
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,056
Why?

736
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:22,731
Because I got tired
of explaining the
black eyes to my friends.

737
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:26,639
Objection. Vincent Bertram
isn't on trial here,
his murderer is.

738
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:30,110
GREER: My client
maintains that she
killed these men

739
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,205
to keep them from
raping or killing her.

740
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:37,953
Now if they have a history
of violent behavior,
the jury should hear it.

741
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:40,487
Overruled.

742
00:33:41,524 --> 00:33:43,048
GREER: Defense three.

743
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:48,086
A domestic incidence report
filed by Mrs. Bertram
in August of Iast year.

744
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:52,297
Now, you called the police
on your husband.

745
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:56,596
What did he do?

746
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:02,872
That night was
unusually bad.

747
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,343
He'd been drinking.

748
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:11,714
He pulled me out of bed
and started to hit me,

749
00:34:13,222 --> 00:34:15,315
then tear off my nightgown.

750
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:18,892
Somehow I got away
and got to the phone.

751
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:22,997
The police showed
up just in time.

752
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,191
He would have raped me

753
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,797
or killed me. I know it.

754
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,943
So, Maggie,
you're a prostitute?

755
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:38,402
MAGGIE: Yes.

756
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:44,583
And you admit to being
responsible for ending
the Iives of Leonard Graves,

757
00:34:44,654 --> 00:34:46,918
Philip Malakowski
and Vincent Bertram.

758
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:49,249
Yes.

759
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:51,287
How do you feel
about all that, Maggie?

760
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,123
MAGGIE:
About being a prostitute?

761
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:56,663
Well, I'm not proud of it.

762
00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:02,328
But I do what I have to
in order to make a Iife
for myself and my son.

763
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,834
About killing those men,
I am sorry they died.

764
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,639
But if I hadn't
protected myself,

765
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,808
they would have killed me.

766
00:35:12,815 --> 00:35:14,840
And my son would be alone.

767
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:17,285
I thought about him.

768
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:20,485
It was the only thing
that I could do.

769
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:23,784
GREER: Nothing further,
Your Honor.

770
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:31,231
You're not proud of
being a prostitute.

771
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:37,804
But you do it anyway
in spite of these
alleged attacks.

772
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:40,107
I don't have a choice.

773
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:42,704
I didn't grow up privileged,

774
00:35:43,045 --> 00:35:44,979
with parents who'd
send me to Iaw school.

775
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:48,045
I'm simply trying
to survive.

776
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:50,852
You say you were
in danger with these men,

777
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,751
that your Iife
was threatened.

778
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:54,050
Yes.

779
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:57,581
But the threat wasn't so great
it stopped you from stealing
their credit cards.

780
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,594
You still found
time to do that.

781
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:01,789
Well, I was only
thinking of my son.

782
00:36:01,864 --> 00:36:03,957
Of how I could
make his Iife better.

783
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,267
CABOT: Everything you do
is for your son?

784
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:09,531
MAGGIE: He's the most
important thing in my Iife.

785
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:11,869
He's the only good thing
that I've ever done.

786
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:15,807
He's my Iittle prince.

787
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:18,506
So every day
you wake up,

788
00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:20,341
you drop your son off
at the babysitter's,

789
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:22,247
and you go to work.

790
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:24,343
You knowingly put
yourself in danger.

791
00:36:25,354 --> 00:36:28,482
You knowingly place
yourself in situations
you cannot control,

792
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:30,492
where you admit
you could be killed.

793
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:34,254
Is that how you
Iove your son?

794
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,766
Is that how you take care
of the most important thing
in your Iife?

795
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,994
I accept the risk.

796
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:42,537
I accept it on
behalf of that boy.

797
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:46,136
I would die for him.

798
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:49,670
You can question my past,

799
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:52,405
you can question my Iife
and my profession,

800
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:58,977
but do not ever question
how much I Iove my son.

801
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:11,393
How the hell did you miss
the domestic incidence report?

802
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:13,162
It wasn't on
his rap sheet.

803
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:14,794
The wife never
filed charges.

804
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,667
Being a batterer does
not make him a rapist.

805
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:19,230
Don't count on the jury
to make that distinction.

806
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:21,776
Look, we've got the weekend
to poke holes in this defense.

807
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:24,972
PIease tell me
the E.R. doc's got a history
of Iying on the stand.

808
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:26,205
Something?

809
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:30,309
Well, not unless she Iied
about it for Maggie's charts
from two years ago.

810
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:33,480
Okay. So we offer

811
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:36,356
one count, man two,
eight-to-10.

812
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:37,653
No way.

813
00:37:38,227 --> 00:37:39,524
Are you paying attention,
AIex?

814
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:40,857
We are screwed.

815
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,125
Do you honestly believe
she killed all of those men
in self-defense?

816
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,962
Who cares what
I believe if she walks?

817
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:46,934
We just give her
exactly what she wants.

818
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:49,164
She convinces the world
she's the victim,

819
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:50,805
she's the perfect mother,

820
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:52,204
she's everybody's
favorite hooker...

821
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:53,572
How old did she say
that her son was?

822
00:37:53,643 --> 00:37:56,771
STABLER: She said he
turned two-and-a-half.
Why?

823
00:37:56,846 --> 00:38:00,577
Which means that
he would've been born
in April 2000.

824
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,708
So?

825
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:03,012
So Iook at
the medical report.

826
00:38:04,954 --> 00:38:06,785
It's dated
March 2000.

827
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:08,653
Para zero,
grav zero.

828
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:10,615
No pregnancies.
No children.

829
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:12,661
Doctor would've known
if she'd been
eight months pregnant.

830
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:14,559
Unless she wasn't.

831
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,222
We have her DNA
from the rape kit.

832
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:17,527
The child is
in ACS custody.

833
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,364
They'II give us
permission for a sample.

834
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:21,903
Where the hell did
she get this kid?

835
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:23,700
She kills to get
what she wants, right?

836
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:26,241
She wanted to be
a mother.

837
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:35,109
Meeting on a Sunday?
Level of desperation
must be pretty high.

838
00:38:35,184 --> 00:38:36,412
Not desperate.

839
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:38,817
Simply fulfilling
my Rosario obligation.

840
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:43,855
So the kid's not hers.
Why does it matter?

841
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,986
Do you want to tell her how
you got your child, Maggie,
or should I?

842
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,864
I don't know what
you're talking about.

843
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:53,834
Let me jog your memory.

844
00:38:54,503 --> 00:38:58,098
Eighteen months ago,
26-year-old Erin Byers
went grocery shopping.

845
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:01,901
Her body was found
in the store parking Iot,
strangled.

846
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:04,938
Her stolen car turned
up a week Iater, intact.

847
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:08,776
Her six-month-old
son was never found.

848
00:39:09,418 --> 00:39:12,046
You'II never be able
to introduce this.

849
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,282
Actually, it was your client
who opened the door.

850
00:39:15,224 --> 00:39:16,987
Everything she does
is for her child.

851
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,151
Right?

852
00:39:18,227 --> 00:39:19,660
The judge will
call a mistrial.

853
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:22,823
Fine.
I'II just re-file and tack on
the kidnapping charges,

854
00:39:22,898 --> 00:39:24,365
plus the murder
of the mother.

855
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:27,862
Do you think a jury
is going to believe

856
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:31,600
your "I kill men
because they beat me"
story now?

857
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:36,236
Do you think the D.A. is going
to give you another pass on
the death penalty? Try it.

858
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:38,704
Where's Joey?

859
00:39:38,781 --> 00:39:41,648
With his father who
thought he was dead.

860
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:44,147
GREER: Is there
an offer on the table?

861
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,179
Murder two on all counts,
concurrent sentences,
15-to-20.

862
00:39:48,257 --> 00:39:49,349
What about
the new charges?

863
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:50,824
We'II talk about
that after I file.

864
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:52,884
You'II never get
a better deal than this.

865
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,622
I'm not pleading guilty.
I did not kill that woman.

866
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:01,129
I found Joey.
She threw him away.

867
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:02,636
It's over.

868
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:05,799
This whole motherhood facade,
this Iie you have told
yourself

869
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,400
and the whole world
is going to be exposed.

870
00:40:20,022 --> 00:40:21,148
I have to think about it.

871
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:23,815
Fine, you can think
about it all you Iike.

872
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:25,793
But if you don't
tell me by tomorrow
morning at 9:00,

873
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:27,556
I'm gonna make up
your mind for you.

874
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:33,801
Is Corrections producing
the defendant,

875
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:35,803
or are we making the jury
wait all day?

876
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:37,600
We may have a plea,
Your Honor.

877
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:40,301
Call down to the pens

878
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:43,868
and see when Miss Peterson
will be gracing us with her
presence.

879
00:40:45,414 --> 00:40:47,405
Yes. Waiting on
Defendant Peterson.

880
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:50,780
There's a problem.

881
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,165
OFFICER: We didn't Ieave
her alone that Iong.

882
00:41:11,073 --> 00:41:15,237
She used her stockings
Iike a noose, and just sat
down till she died.

883
00:41:20,683 --> 00:41:24,380
"Last will and testament.
I Ieave all my
worldly belongings

884
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:27,251
"to my beloved son.
Without him, I am nothing."

885
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:30,887
There's a number for
a safety deposit box.

886
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,655
Says there's
10 grand in there.

887
00:41:32,728 --> 00:41:35,993
Her Iast act,
and this is when she decides
to be selfless?

888
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:37,763
Look at her.

889
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,960
Every hair in place,
perfect make-up.

890
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,562
She gets to go out
Iike a beauty queen,

891
00:41:42,638 --> 00:41:45,539
and everybody thinks
she's sacrificing herself.

892
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:46,700
It's a performance.

893
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,210
Performance of her Iife.
