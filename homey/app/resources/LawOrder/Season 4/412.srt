00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:04,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:05,998
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:09,043
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:12,638
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,341
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:18,781
AII right,
I got the pick.
I got the pick.

8
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:20,446
Switch! Switch!

9
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:23,113
I got you.

10
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,419
What you got?
What you got?

11
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:26,188
LYNN: Help me!

12
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:27,956
Help me!

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,055
Help me, please!

14
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:31,224
My God.

15
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:32,766
Help me!

16
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:34,768
Lynn, what's wrong?

17
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:36,201
He's not breathing.

18
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,898
My baby's not breathing.

19
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:39,736
Tuck, call 911.
AII right.

20
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:40,866
Hurry up!

21
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:42,000
Jawan!

22
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:43,476
Oh, my God!

23
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:46,070
(SOBBING)

24
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:48,480
Baby's name
is Jawan Hauser,
10 weeks old.

25
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,075
EMS brought him in
a couple of hours ago.

26
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:52,177
How's he doing?

27
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:54,119
On a respirator,
his pulse is weak.

28
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,747
Kid was probably
oxygen deprived.

29
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:58,190
We won't know the extent
of the brain damage
until he wakes up,

30
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,352
if he ever does.

31
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:00,588
We talking shaken baby?

32
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:02,823
Body scan's negative
for healed fractures.

33
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,058
Head CT normal.

34
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,066
No bruising
or retinal hemorrhaging.

35
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:08,295
So, you must have
brought us in here
for a reason.

36
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,803
I was concerned
when he came in.

37
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:12,669
EIevated heart rate,
shallow respirations,
dilated pupils.

38
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,231
Sounds Iike an OD.

39
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:16,800
You're right.
Tox screen's positive
for cocaine.

40
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,903
Someone doped this kid up.

41
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:10,597
Cocaine?

42
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:12,360
And you think
I gave it to my baby?

43
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:13,731
We're not jumping
to any conclusions.

44
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,326
Because I'm black,
Iive in the projects,

45
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:16,893
so I must be
doing drugs, right?

46
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:18,735
Why don't we calm down?
That's not what we're saying.

47
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,638
My mother was a junkie.

48
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:22,734
I never touched that dope
in my Iife.

49
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,608
I worked my ass off
cleaning houses

50
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,977
to keep me and Jawan
in that apartment.

51
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,885
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

52
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,119
I picked up Jawan
from his daycare after work,

53
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:39,751
brought him home.

54
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,228
I fed him,
but he wasn't very hungry

55
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,559
because he went
right to sleep,

56
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,327
so I put him
in his crib.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,494
When I checked on him,
he was hardly breathing.

58
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,935
Is Jawan dead?

59
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:51,632
No. No. No.

60
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,004
But the doctors say
that the cocaine Iooks Iike

61
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:55,872
it was mixed in
with the baby formula.

62
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:57,639
Oh, God.

63
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,373
How did that happen?

64
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,539
Well, we need
to find out fast.

65
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,845
Where'd you buy
the formula?

66
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:03,942
At the store.

67
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,486
Which store?

68
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,513
I don't remember.

69
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,649
Lynn, you gotta
Iisten to me.

70
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,454
You do not want
to be responsible

71
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,859
for that poison being fed
to another baby.

72
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:19,792
It was my fault.
I borrowed it.

73
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:21,992
From the people
that you clean for?

74
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,197
I was short on money,
so I had to.

75
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:26,797
I swear, I was gonna
give it back.

76
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:29,643
Oh, my God.

77
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,544
You have to call them.
They have a 4-month-old boy.

78
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,618
Thank God
I got your message.

79
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,348
Tommy and I
just got back
from the park.

80
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:42,447
I was about to
feed him.

81
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,185
Baby Growth
is the brand we use,

82
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,521
but you said
someone poisoned it?

83
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:47,221
I can't believe
she would do
something Iike that.

84
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,160
Well, we can't take
any chances.

85
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:51,529
My God, if I had
given it to Tommy...

86
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,192
I keep all the formula
in here.

87
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:55,168
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
we're gonna need to do that.
Sorry.

88
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,761
Do you remember how many
cans you had Ieft?

89
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,635
Six. I buy it by the case.

90
00:03:58,707 --> 00:03:59,901
BENSON: I count five.

91
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:01,465
Lynn must have taken
the missing can.

92
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:02,874
LAURA: I never noticed.

93
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,378
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
it's urgent that we know

94
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:07,779
where and when you bought
this baby formula.

95
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,976
My husband got it
a couple of days ago.

96
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,178
Gentry's Market on Columbus.

97
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,189
We took every can
of formula
off the shelves at Gentry's,

98
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:17,088
tested each one.
AII clear.

99
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,750
What about the ones
in Pfeiffer's pantry?

100
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:20,089
Four, perfectly
normal Iiquid,

101
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,253
and the other one
had the same chemistry

102
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,058
as the stuff fed
to Jawan Hauser.

103
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,655
Cocaine-Iaced
baby formula.

104
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,032
I wouldn't call it formula.
It's 90% pure Iiquid cocaine.

105
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,298
That purity probably came
from south of the border.

106
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:32,169
I've never seen it
smuggled this way before.

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,504
Take a Iook, solder plug.

108
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:35,770
That's where
they drained the formula

109
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:37,311
and refilled it
with Iiquid coke.

110
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,313
Seal it up,
glue the Iabel back on,

111
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:41,508
ship a couple of cases
to los Estados Unidos,

112
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,982
nobody's any the wiser.

113
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:44,848
They gotta have Iabs
on both sides
of the border

114
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,716
to turn it into Iiquid,
then back into powder.

115
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,585
And how'd this end up
on some store shelf?

116
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:51,751
I can't help you there,
but the manufacturer can.

117
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:54,294
Baby formula's closely
regulated by the FDA.

118
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,592
Each can has a Iot number
and expiration date on top.

119
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:59,828
You can find out
where it was made
and purchased.

120
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:00,925
I called the FDA.

121
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:03,732
They're gonna issue
a CIass I recall,
highest priority.

122
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:06,399
AII the FDA can do
is ask the company
to pull the product.

123
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,271
Not when it involves
infant formula.

124
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:10,573
Then they have the authority.
How're we doing?

125
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,772
Every can of Baby Growth
in the market

126
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,405
and every clean can
at the Pfeiffers'

127
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,211
was made
at the Atlanta plant.

128
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,546
And the two bad cans?

129
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:18,950
Lot numbers
weren't even close.

130
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,282
Why? Because
they were manufactured

131
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,347
at the Baby Growth plant
in Mexico. Juárez.

132
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:25,052
Cartel country.

133
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:27,026
So, our friends
get it down there,

134
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,893
replace the Spanish
Ianguage Iabels
with ones in English,

135
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:31,158
and then they smuggle it
up here.

136
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,427
Yeah, the question is
how did those two cans
from Mexico

137
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,763
end up in
the Pfeiffers' closet?

138
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,269
Well, what do we know
about the Pfeiffers?

139
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:39,068
She's home with the baby.
The husband's name is Derek.

140
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,129
He's a stockbroker,

141
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,075
works at a firm
called Chandler Hinton
down on Wall Street.

142
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,236
Well, that wouldn't be
the first time

143
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:45,870
some big shot,
hard up for cash,

144
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,006
moonlighted in
the drug biz.

145
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,574
Derek Pfeiffer sounds
Iike our perfect candidate.

146
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:51,846
Credit report in the dumper.

147
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,218
Filing for bankruptcy
when he miraculously erases

148
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,257
$300,000 in debt.

149
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,951
Sudden windfall?
Benson.

150
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:00,290
Yeah, Iike the kind you get
from a big drug shipment.

151
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:01,852
Who says crime doesn't pay?

152
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,022
Yeah.

153
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:06,130
That was the hospital.

154
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:08,726
Jawan Hauser died
a half-hour ago.

155
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,566
That's depraved
indifference murder

156
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:13,698
for whoever smuggled that coke
in those formula cans.

157
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:14,833
Go talk to Pfeiffer.

158
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,208
If you don't Iike
what he has to say,
bring him in.

159
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:26,083
I really appreciate
you guys getting that stuff
out of my house

160
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:27,314
before something bad
happened.

161
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,654
That's no problem.
We just gotta figure out
how it got in your house.

162
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,352
That's easy.
I bought it.

163
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:35,555
Problem is, there
wasn't another bad
can in that store,

164
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,495
which means
the only two cans
of Iiquid cocaine

165
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,466
on the Upper West Side
were in your pantry.

166
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,104
I wish
I could help you guys.

167
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:45,833
MUNCH: Take any trips
out of the country
Iately, Derek?

168
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:48,273
Say, Iike, down Mexico way?

169
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:50,642
I have clients
all over the world.

170
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:53,875
That's okay,
you don't have to tell us.
We can check with Customs.

171
00:06:56,851 --> 00:07:00,309
I just got back
from Mexico City
on company business.

172
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,618
Look, it's not good
for me to be seen here

173
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,249
talking to you guys
Iike this in the office.

174
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:06,816
What a coincidence.
We were gonna suggest

175
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:07,953
that you come down
to our office

176
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,553
and continue
this discussion.

177
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,592
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

178
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,826
Sure you are.

179
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:16,268
Or you'II be seen
wearing steel when we
drag you out of here.

180
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,128
Is this really necessary?

181
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,072
I have five client meetings
this afternoon.

182
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,337
Believe me,
that's the Ieast
of your problems.

183
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:24,969
STABLER: Uh-oh.

184
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:26,070
What's the matter?

185
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,239
I smell a rat.

186
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:28,441
Big time.

187
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,349
Sergeant Tucker, to what
do we owe this visit
from Internal Affairs?

188
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,478
FIN: Don't forget to salute
or you'II get a 30-day rip.

189
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:34,544
What are you doing?

190
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,249
Standing here
talking to a friend.

191
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,416
His name Derek Pfeiffer?

192
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:38,516
What's it to you?

193
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:40,322
Mr. Pfeiffer's
coming with me.

194
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,692
We got a dead kid
on our hands.

195
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:43,526
That baby is no Ionger
your concern.

196
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,122
Narcotics dime us?

197
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,134
AII you need to know
is your captain
signed off on it.

198
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,794
Mr. Pfeiffer, my name
is Sergeant Tucker.

199
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,202
You need to come
with me, sir.

200
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,274
Our captain told you
where we were?

201
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:00,478
What's the deal
with Tucker?

202
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:01,776
Sergeant Tucker
from IAB?

203
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,839
Yeah, did you send him?

204
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,817
Send him?
What's going on here?
Where's Pfeiffer?

205
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,183
Tucker took him
right out
of our hands.

206
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:08,119
Said he had your okay.

207
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:11,785
Let's take a ride.

208
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:15,320
Captain Cragen,
Detective Stabler.
How can I help you?

209
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,057
You Iying son of a bitch.

210
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:19,224
Now, it's not enough
you go behind my back
to steal our case.

211
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,200
Now you want my people
thinking I'm in your pocket.

212
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,736
Get off me now.

213
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:23,896
You don't need
what he can do to you.

214
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:25,599
Just relax.

215
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:28,799
I should Iock you up.

216
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,572
Do it. Then explain it
to your bosses.

217
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,203
You need anger
management, Captain.

218
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,009
And you need to kiss my ass.

219
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:35,049
Where's Derek Pfeiffer?

220
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,447
We questioned him
and Iet him go.

221
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:37,883
He's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

222
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,544
Any of your people
go near him,

223
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:40,918
and you'II go
before a trial board.

224
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:42,149
Good, and then
you can explain

225
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,191
why an infant died
on your watch.

226
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,726
I want to know
what the hell's
going on here.

227
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,556
I don't have to
tell you squat.

228
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,722
IAB investigating
means a dirty cop's
involved.

229
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:50,786
I want a name.

230
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:51,854
Go to hell.

231
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,062
So, now what's
our next move?

232
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:59,003
Pick up Derek Pfeiffer.

233
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:00,631
You really wanna
take on IAB?

234
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,471
Tucker doesn't tell us
how to do our jobs.

235
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:05,707
Look, EIIiot,
you're following an order
from your CO.

236
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,408
If it gets ugly,
that's what you tell them.

237
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:11,509
If we hurry,
we can catch Pfeiffer
just Ieaving work.

238
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,719
Hey, Special Victims,
what's up?

239
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,848
Came in as a 34.

240
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,189
Suit, not breathing,
in a bathroom
on the 20th floor.

241
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,421
That's where Pfeiffer works.

242
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:34,605
BENSON: Damn it.
It's Pfeiffer.

243
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:40,339
Somebody beat us to him.

244
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,478
MUNCH: Whoever killed Pfeiffer
must've followed him in

245
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,316
and got him
before he closed
the stall door.

246
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:48,446
Cable he was
strangled with

247
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:50,354
could've came
from any office
in this building.

248
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,518
Perp could've
brought it in to
make it Iook that way.

249
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,084
This is Keith Gerard.

250
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:56,289
He's Mr. Pfeiffer's
immediate boss.

251
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:57,922
Detectives Munch
and Tutuola.

252
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,057
Sorry for your Ioss.

253
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,725
I don't know
how this happens
in a business Iike this.

254
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:02,702
Building's been
Iocked down tight
since 9/11,

255
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,204
all visitors signed in
and escorted by security.

256
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,764
Probably 10 other ways
to get in,
nothing's foolproof.

257
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,833
Possible one
of Pfeiffer's clients
had it in for him?

258
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:11,469
If Iosing money
were enough
to set someone off,

259
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:12,706
we'd all be dead by now.

260
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,077
Derek's desk. Feel free.

261
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,672
Anything unusual about
his behavior Iately?

262
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,445
Derek was under
a Iot of stress.

263
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:18,951
You mean because of
the market going south?

264
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,612
No, I mean he got demoted.

265
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:21,677
What happened?

266
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,383
His biggest accounts
Iost millions.

267
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,551
The investors
called for his head
and they got it.

268
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:26,753
He used to run the floor.

269
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:28,022
And then
you stepped in.

270
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:30,121
Believe me, that's not
how I wanted it to happen.

271
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:31,187
You mind telling us
where you've been

272
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:32,562
for the Iast
couple of hours?

273
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:34,295
Sure. Meeting with
the managing partners.

274
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,461
Well, we're gonna
need their names

275
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,060
and a Iist
of Pfeiffer's accounts.

276
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,231
I'II have my assistant
get it for you.

277
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,472
This has gotta be a hit.

278
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:45,876
They knew Pfeiffer
was talking to us
and they shut him up.

279
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:48,472
That means his wife's
a target, too.

280
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:52,316
Derek never would have
been involved with drugs.

281
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:54,048
We think that
your husband smuggled in

282
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:55,646
the baby formula
from Mexico.

283
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,350
No, you're wrong.

284
00:10:57,425 --> 00:11:00,189
Did you know your husband
was demoted at work?

285
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:01,417
No.

286
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:04,158
Did you know
he filed for bankruptcy?

287
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,566
I knew we were in debt,

288
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,068
but Derek said
he paid everything off.

289
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:14,369
Bonus for closing
a big deal, he told me.

290
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:16,369
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
did your husband

291
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,674
ever talk to you
about work?

292
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:22,045
No, he said he didn't want
to bring the job home

293
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:24,676
because he worked
so many hours.

294
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:27,448
Are all those hours
at the office?

295
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,752
He used to entertain clients,

296
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:33,123
three nights a week,
at the Bear and Bull.

297
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,594
Did you ever meet
any of his
business associates?

298
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:39,360
No, I told you,
Derek didn't want us
in that world.

299
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,368
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

300
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:44,200
Mrs. Pfeiffer, if your
husband was murdered

301
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:46,001
because of his
involvement with drugs,

302
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:49,009
the people who
killed him may think
you know something.

303
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:51,204
Oh, my God.

304
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,747
Are you telling me
Tommy and I are in danger?

305
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:56,249
Two detectives are
on their way over here.

306
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,285
They're gonna stay with you.
It's for your own safety.

307
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,376
No.

308
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:02,146
No, we'II go to
my sister's.

309
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,418
I'II feel more
comfortable there.

310
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,823
Has somebody
threatened you?

311
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:10,253
Mrs. Pfeiffer?

312
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:19,372
After you were here,
a man knocked on the door.

313
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:23,035
Said Derek sent him
to pick up the formula.

314
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:25,306
I told him
I gave it to you,

315
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,506
and he got really upset.

316
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:29,812
I asked him how he got
past the doorman,

317
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:33,149
and he showed me his badge.

318
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:37,752
It's an IAB operation,

319
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,816
and I warned you
to back off.

320
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:40,883
Your detectives...

321
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:42,327
Were following my orders.

322
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,091
Now who else at IAB
was in on this?

323
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:46,099
Don't even try
and pin this on me here.

324
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:49,193
Only five people
in this squad
knew about this case.

325
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,637
Three of us are here,
and the other two
are cleaning up your mess.

326
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,106
Now, I still got
a few friends on this job

327
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:56,268
who wear stars
on their shoulders.

328
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:59,336
You wanna tell them
how this went down,
or should I?

329
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,214
Twice, over the Iast year,

330
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:06,583
Narcotics tried to infiltrate
your baby formula
cocaine ring.

331
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,383
Undercovers got made
both times.

332
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,923
By your dirty cop.

333
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,253
Narcotics thought
it was one of theirs.

334
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,849
That's why they
turned it over to us.

335
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,394
BENSON: And you have
no idea who it is?

336
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,554
We're not sure.

337
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,860
You're not sure
about much, are you?

338
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,661
You know, our D.A.
could've made a deal
with Pfeiffer

339
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,826
to give up your dirty cop

340
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:22,494
if you hadn't crapped
all over our case.

341
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,060
It's our case, Detective.

342
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,162
Not anymore.

343
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,106
Your people can't handle
this kind of work.

344
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:30,838
My people do
this kind of work every day.

345
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,675
A baby died
of cocaine poisoning,

346
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:35,147
and we're damn well
gonna find out
who's responsible.

347
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,205
Now, you wanna help us, fine,

348
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,878
otherwise get the hell
out of our way.

349
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,117
AII right.

350
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:44,851
What do you need?

351
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:49,053
Fake IDs, vehicles,
drugs and buy money,
for starters.

352
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:55,995
You don't make a move
without telling me.

353
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,200
Checked everyone
on the security Iog
at Chandler Hinton.

354
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:03,437
AII visitors accounted for
and nothing useful
from the canvass.

355
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,035
Pfeiffer's phone records
any help?

356
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,773
Well, the only thing
that stands out

357
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,078
is that whenever Pfeiffer
was at the Bear and Bull,

358
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,846
he always called home
from a pay phone instead
of using his cell.

359
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,318
Sounds Iike
he doesn't want
anyone to know

360
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:14,581
who else he's calling.

361
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:15,713
CIassic paranoia.

362
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,985
Could be where he does
his other business.

363
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,321
Hey, there's plenty
of drug activity

364
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,827
down at some of those joints
in the financial district.

365
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:23,761
Coke to fuel
the high stress jobs.

366
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,992
You're the one with
undercover experience.

367
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,160
I go Iooking to score
in one of them
Wall Street bars,

368
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,466
I might as well
put a sign on my back
that says "cop."

369
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:34,668
But EIIiot here,
he Iooks Iike the clean-cut
corporate type.

370
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:36,642
Well, if that's
a compliment,
I'm game.

371
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,542
AII right.
OIivia and Fin
will ghost you.

372
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:39,637
Munch and I
are backups.

373
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,272
We need to get you
a cover story.

374
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:43,078
Baby formula scheme's
down the toilet,

375
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,710
so they're gonna be
Iooking for a new way
to bring in the product.

376
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,413
You wanna get
their attention real fast,

377
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:49,479
you gotta be the solution.

378
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,491
And I gotta be
vulnerable.

379
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,292
Never flash
your buy money.

380
00:14:54,362 --> 00:14:57,160
If they offer to buy,
you know the test.

381
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,559
Snow seals.

382
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,261
There's a quarter gram
of coke in each one.

383
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,996
And take this.

384
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,367
What are you gonna do,
page me?

385
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:06,929
It's a wire.
If they frisk you,
they'II never suspect it.

386
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:08,635
Got it from a buddy
in TARU.

387
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:09,903
We got backup inside.

388
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,945
I'II be out here
recording. Cool?

389
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:14,306
Yeah.

390
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:21,187
(SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

391
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,086
How's it going?

392
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,252
What can I get you?

393
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:28,920
Give me a beer,
that Iast one on the end,

394
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,624
and give the Iady
whatever she's having.

395
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:32,893
BARTENDER:
Scotch on the rocks?

396
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:33,991
Yeah.

397
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:35,057
You got it.

398
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,160
Thank you.

399
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:38,205
You're welcome.
How you doing?

400
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,705
I'm not bad.
How are you?

401
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:41,897
Better now.

402
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,843
BARTENDER: Here we go.
That'II be 12 bucks.

403
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:49,773
(LAUGHS)
Sorry about that.

404
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,446
(CHUCKLING)

405
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,978
That any good?

406
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,052
I'II tell you what,
why don't you
just take a Iittle taste

407
00:15:58,126 --> 00:15:59,388
and you tell me?

408
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:02,624
I can turn you on
to something
a Iittle fresher.

409
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:04,765
Have a taste.

410
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,028
What's your name?

411
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:08,965
Donna.

412
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,973
He's talking to somebody
at the end of the bar.

413
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,236
Probably the resident dealer.

414
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:20,210
And he's coming back.

415
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:23,912
I'm good. That's for you.

416
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:27,513
Gentleman down
the end of the bar
would Iike a word with you.

417
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,384
He interested?

418
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,449
Says he'II make it
worth your while.

419
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:45,604
He's following some guy
into the bathroom.

420
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:50,870
Whoa.

421
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,648
This your idea
of a conversation?

422
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:57,014
You trying to sell
this crap on my turf?

423
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:58,109
Who the hell are you?

424
00:16:58,186 --> 00:16:59,175
Who am I?
Yeah.

425
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:00,846
I'm the guy whose spot
you're parked in.

426
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:03,857
And I gotta tell you, pal,
I don't Iike competition,
okay?

427
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,722
Wait a minute.
This guy said
you were interested.

428
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,694
This is a big
misunderstanding.

429
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:10,288
Hey, I don't want
a problem here,
man, really.

430
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:12,526
So, what's your name?

431
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:13,727
Here.

432
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:17,970
Greg EIIiot.

433
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:21,604
So, Greg, where are you
serving out of?

434
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,104
Building where my office is.

435
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,808
And how much?
How much...

436
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:29,874
How much quantity?

437
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:34,178
Three hundred grams
every two weeks, about.

438
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:37,591
That's... That's impressive.

439
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:38,648
Yeah.

440
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:39,751
What are you paying
your supplier?

441
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:40,852
Ninety.

442
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,021
Ninety.

443
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:45,565
I'II tell you, Greg,
my people could do better.

444
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,037
My customers Iike
what they're getting.

445
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:51,538
The stuff I got,
it's top quality.

446
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:55,639
Okay, I'm Iistening.

447
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,938
Good. Good.

448
00:17:57,012 --> 00:18:01,881
Why don't you meet me
tonight at the entrance
to the seaport, say, 8:00?

449
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,477
And bring your money.

450
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:21,127
Who's he?

451
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,563
Shut up.

452
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,834
Nice to meet you, too.

453
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,307
He's clean.

454
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:33,545
Still didn't answer
my question.

455
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,683
You got the money?

456
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,876
Wow!

457
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:40,851
Wow, you wanna show me
the product?

458
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:06,146
It's a Iittle better
than mine.

459
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:08,876
Seventy a gram,
introductory offer.

460
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,349
Then we renegotiate.

461
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:12,477
No, you gotta do
better than that.

462
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:15,318
Why don't you taste it?

463
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,915
Taste it, because they do
random drug tests
where I work.

464
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:18,982
I don't do this stuff.

465
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,925
AII right.
AII right. AII right.

466
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:23,226
Seventy a gram.
Permanent price.

467
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,762
Permanent price. Done.

468
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,808
Hey. Hey.
Take the money.

469
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,309
What're you doing?

470
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:37,402
You guys, Iook. Hey.

471
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,741
He's got a gun,
Captain.

472
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,371
FIN: Wait a minute.

473
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:41,574
Everybody, hang tight.

474
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,311
Show me a badge.

475
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,611
Oh.

476
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:46,711
He's got a gold shield.

477
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,585
STABLER: Look, guys,
Iet's talk about this.

478
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:50,557
Now he's got
EIIiot's wallet.

479
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,355
What do you say?
You gonna read me
my rights?

480
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:55,521
You don't got
any rights.

481
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:01,965
Well, I guess we just
found our dirty cop.

482
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:14,571
This doesn't Iook
Iike any police station
I've ever seen.

483
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,982
You think
I'm gonna do business
with some dumbass punk?

484
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:18,042
Are we just gonna
sit here

485
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,382
while they beat
the crap out of him?

486
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:21,252
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd be dead by now.

487
00:20:21,324 --> 00:20:22,723
What is this?
Some sort of initiation?

488
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:25,488
The guy with the shield
just wants to show
he's the alpha dog,

489
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:27,586
to mark his spot.

490
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:29,028
Your call, Captain.

491
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:31,430
You see a gun come out,
move. Don't wait.

492
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,765
I hope you didn't
bring me here
just to kick my ass.

493
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,868
Gregory EIIiot,
married, four kids,
house in Forest Hills.

494
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:46,370
You still got
that gambling problem,
Greg?

495
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:49,779
What's that?
Your homework assignment?

496
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:55,518
Director of Station Operations
for GIobal Package Express.

497
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:56,580
What's that mean?

498
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,219
I run our worldwide
shipping stations.

499
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:02,389
What are you doing?
Putting together my résumé?

500
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:03,693
Must be
a Iot of travel.

501
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,461
Yeah, I do my share.

502
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:08,594
I think you're just
the guy we're Iooking for.

503
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:12,736
Guys, I just sell the stuff,
small quantities.

504
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:13,866
I don't move it.

505
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:15,035
You do now.

506
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,102
I'm telling you,
I'm selling this

507
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,147
for an old friend of mine,
that's it.

508
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:21,206
You want Ioyalty,
get a puppy.

509
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:24,344
I got you with enough blow
for an A-1 felony.

510
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,388
That's Iife
without parole.

511
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:28,150
You don't think my company
doesn't have safeguards

512
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:30,021
to prevent people
from doing this sort of thing?

513
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:31,719
Then you're gonna have to
think outside the box,

514
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:33,785
Iike they teach you
in business school.

515
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:36,263
You got till
tomorrow to decide.

516
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:38,328
Phone number's
on there.

517
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:39,527
Who's answering?

518
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,431
Call me Kendall.
Oh, one more thing.

519
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:43,494
Yeah.

520
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,669
That's for the attitude.

521
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:53,678
Can I have
my wallet?

522
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:05,590
How's the patient?

523
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:07,185
Couple of scratches.
He'II Iive.

524
00:22:07,263 --> 00:22:08,560
CRAGEN: What'd you find out?

525
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:10,428
Brad Kendall's
got 13 years on the job,

526
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:11,989
nine in Manhattan Narcotics.

527
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:14,434
He's got more decorations
than you can hang
on a Christmas tree.

528
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:16,767
Sounds Iike he was
a good cop once.

529
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,136
Nothing Iower
than a commendation,

530
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:19,572
even got a combat cross.

531
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,576
MUNCH: He walked in
on a gas station robbery,

532
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:23,077
perps shot at him
and missed.

533
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:24,237
He killed them both.

534
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:26,440
Decade of watching
drug dealers
make the big bucks,

535
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:27,982
guess he wanted
a piece of the action.

536
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,848
If I had went Kendall's route,
I could've been
a rich man by now.

537
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,820
He matches
Laura Pfeiffer's description

538
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:35,288
of a cop who came Iooking
for baby formula.

539
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,952
We know if Kendall
ever made an appearance
there before?

540
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:39,324
I spoke to all the doormen
in the building.

541
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:41,056
It was only that one time.

542
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,496
Which means Pfeiffer
normally delivered
the cocaine to him.

543
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:44,897
Probably at
the Bear and Bull.

544
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,559
Okay, what about
Kendall's butt boy?

545
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,034
Frank Barry.

546
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:51,596
Thirty. In and out of prison
on a string of drug collars,

547
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,471
mostly for possession.

548
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,976
Never carried enough weight
to be charged
with intent to sell.

549
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:57,478
Well, he and Kendall
are soldiers.

550
00:22:57,546 --> 00:23:00,481
There's no way they got
the brains or the muscle
to run an operation Iike this.

551
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,710
We don't even know
how big this thing is.

552
00:23:02,785 --> 00:23:05,310
But there's no way
that Pfeiffer's
their only mule.

553
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:06,912
Well, Kendall
gave you 24 hours.

554
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:08,684
That means he's hard up
for product.

555
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:09,850
If he doesn't
get some soon,

556
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:13,088
the people that buy
from him are gonna cop
from somebody else.

557
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:14,924
Get back to Kendall.

558
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:17,591
Turn up the heat this time,
but meet in a public place.

559
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,759
We don't want
a rerun of tonight.

560
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:32,509
Why here?

561
00:23:34,383 --> 00:23:36,442
This is where
I do business.

562
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,716
You know, I don't remember
us talking money

563
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:41,689
while you were
kicking my ass.

564
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:44,317
I'm Ietting you
stay out of jail.

565
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:46,623
There's nothing
to talk about.

566
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:52,098
Oh, no?
Well, what's to stop me
from going to the cops

567
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:54,568
and telling them
you're shaking me down?

568
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:57,462
I'm a hero cop.

569
00:23:58,374 --> 00:24:00,001
I mean, who do you think
they're gonna believe?

570
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:03,010
Then you must think
I am some dumbass punk, huh?

571
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,271
You know what I think?

572
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:08,108
You're trying
to stay in business.

573
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:10,784
What, you got
a crystal ball or something?

574
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:14,311
You need me so bad
you're blackmailing me
to work for you.

575
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,790
That smells
of desperation to me.

576
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:20,560
I'II tell you what,
hero cop, you're right.

577
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:21,653
Lock me up.

578
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:26,961
What do you want?

579
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:29,334
A third of the profits
of whatever I ship,

580
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:31,771
after you tell me
why I'm the answer
to your problems.

581
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:33,741
What's the difference?
It's business.

582
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,778
I don't do business
with Iiars or screw-ups.

583
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:42,677
(CHUCKLES)

584
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:44,844
I'II take it to my people.

585
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,909
I don't know
what that means.

586
00:24:45,988 --> 00:24:47,512
What does that mean,
take it to your people?

587
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,387
What, you can't close
the deal?

588
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:52,450
I mean, doesn't sound
Iike you're very high up
in the food chain.

589
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:55,053
Maybe I should be talking
to someone who has
a Iittle more juice.

590
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,223
No, you're dealing with me.

591
00:25:00,603 --> 00:25:01,695
Okay.

592
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:04,469
Have it your way.
You go "talk to your people."

593
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,905
See if they can afford me,

594
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:09,376
and I'II Iet you know
of my decision.

595
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:13,538
Try the veal,
it's great.

596
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:22,154
Okay, I'II call you back
with the details.

597
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:27,958
What do they want you
to do?

598
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,998
Bring in 10 boxes
of terracotta tiles

599
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,532
made of cocaine base.

600
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,569
Four kilos per box,
each worth $80,000.

601
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:37,765
My cover story,
I'm retiling my kitchen.

602
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,307
Where's it coming from?

603
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,433
Mexico City.

604
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:44,712
Gotta find a reason
to get me on down there.

605
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,714
Mexico's a Iittle
out of our jurisdiction.

606
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:49,250
Not to mention,
out of our Ieague.

607
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:51,946
Okay, you tell Kendall

608
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,818
you can't make the trip
on such short notice

609
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:55,220
without arousing suspicion.

610
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,260
Somebody in Mexico City
will make the pickup for you.

611
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:58,954
Where's the drop?

612
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:02,357
My alter ego's house
in Forest Hills.

613
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,464
Delivery company
drops off the tiles,

614
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:06,092
Kendall will come
and pick them up.

615
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:08,296
We'II have to involve DEA.

616
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:09,497
They can get us
a cover house

617
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:11,234
and handle
the pickup in Mexico.

618
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:14,106
Kendall could be working
with DEA people.

619
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:18,108
Well, that's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

620
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:27,821
That's the Iast one, sir.

621
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:29,415
Thanks a Iot.

622
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:47,672
This is the most
we've been able
to bring in at one time.

623
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:49,678
I guess you're saying
you're a satisfied
customer then.

624
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:52,306
That'II be $267,000.

625
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:54,111
You wanna count it?

626
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:57,183
I don't know. Do I need to?

627
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:00,282
Now Iet's move these.

628
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:04,385
Honey, are those the tiles?

629
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,227
No, it's a mistake.

630
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:10,528
They're the wrong ones.
This guy's gonna
exchange them.

631
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,034
He's got ours in his van.
Hey, this is my wife Dana.

632
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:14,434
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

633
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:15,801
Baby, you gotta get
in the shower.

634
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:17,737
We have to be
at Vanessa and GIen's
in Iess than two hours.

635
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:19,297
Oh, are these the tiles?
STABLER: I don't want to go...

636
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,742
Hey, hey, hey.
What's he doing back here?

637
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,479
Yo, I must've
not signed for it.
He must've made a mistake.

638
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:26,708
I'II deal with this.

639
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:28,444
KENDALL: Son of a bitch.

640
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:30,114
Back off!

641
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:37,557
Police, Kendall, freeze!

642
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:39,959
Freeze! Drop the gun!

643
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,622
Drop your gun.

644
00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:43,757
Drop your gun.
Drop your gun!

645
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,198
Drop it!

646
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:55,034
Drop the...

647
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:02,980
You okay?
Call the bus.

648
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:05,749
FIN: 10-13, Manhattan SVU.
We got an officer shot.

649
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:10,384
We're at 6432 99th Street,
Forest Hills, send a bus.

650
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,722
What happened?
He turned around.

651
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:13,319
I had no choice.
The son of a bitch
just turned on me.

652
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:14,420
Okay.
He turned on me.

653
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:15,725
Okay. Take it easy.
He turned on me.

654
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,232
I had no choice.

655
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,528
He wanted me to shoot him.

656
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,967
Son of a bitch
wanted me to shoot him.

657
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:25,236
Why'd he make me do that?
Why?

658
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,569
He didn't have the guts
to do it himself.

659
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:33,707
EIIiot, I need your gun.

660
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:35,410
I know the drill.

661
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,368
STABLER: Upon realizing
he was the target

662
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:53,766
of our sting operation,

663
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:55,668
Detective Kendall
pulled his weapon

664
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,764
on Detective Benson
and myself.

665
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:58,830
What happened next?

666
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:00,136
He ran. I followed.

667
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,370
AIone?

668
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:03,745
Detective Benson
wasn't armed.

669
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:06,304
Undercover operation,
it was her call.

670
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:07,849
But you were armed.
My call.

671
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:09,384
I didn't trust Kendall.

672
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:11,579
Are you sure you don't want
your union delegate here?

673
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:12,678
I've got nothing to hide.

674
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:15,224
Now how many more times
are we gonna go over this?

675
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:18,351
Detective Kendall
never fired his weapon,
but you did.

676
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:22,490
After I identified myself
as a police officer

677
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:25,193
and ordered Detective Kendall
to drop his weapon,

678
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:27,259
he turned
and pointed it at me.

679
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,464
Just Iike I told you before.

680
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:32,904
And how many times
did you fire your weapon?

681
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:34,034
Two.

682
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:37,472
Because you saw him
raise his weapon.

683
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:40,414
To shoot me.

684
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,376
There's nothing else
I could've done.

685
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:52,056
I'm officially notifying you
you're on modified assignment,

686
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:56,292
restricted to your office
until our investigation
is completed.

687
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,492
You're not to make
any arrests

688
00:29:57,567 --> 00:30:00,161
or interrogate any suspects
until then.

689
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:02,227
Is that clear, Detective?

690
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:09,938
The bastard makes me
shoot him,

691
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:11,480
and I'm the one
under investigation.

692
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:13,482
EIIiot, maybe you ought to
take a few vacation days.

693
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,518
Not until I find out
who bankrolled Kendall.

694
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,485
I killed him,
I killed our only Iead.

695
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,181
EIIiot, the Iab found
dandruff flakes

696
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:21,849
on the computer cable
used to strangle
Derek Pfeiffer.

697
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:23,654
Matches Kendall's DNA.

698
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:26,422
So Kendall whacked Pfeiffer
to shut him up,

699
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:28,361
probably on orders
from the top.

700
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:30,922
With Kendall gone,
we may never find out
who that is.

701
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,525
Well, Kendall
arranged that shipment
of tiles somehow.

702
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:35,127
Anything on the phones?

703
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,729
Just a few Iocal calls
to family members.

704
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:37,830
Nothing suspicious.

705
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:40,671
We also took
a prepaid cell off him,
untraceable.

706
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:42,370
What about his gofer,
Frank Barry?

707
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,572
We haven't found him yet,
but he's too Iow
on the totem pole

708
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:46,547
to have access
to the top guy.

709
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:48,447
Maybe Laura Pfeiffer
can fill in the blanks.

710
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:49,576
BENSON: How?

711
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:51,210
We found the bad formula
in her kitchen,

712
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:53,278
we're thinking
Derek brought it in.

713
00:30:53,356 --> 00:30:54,345
But when I called customs

714
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:55,721
to check on his trips
to Mexico,

715
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,487
we found out
she traveled there, too.

716
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,584
When?

717
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:00,925
In the Iast three weeks,
five round trips
with her baby,

718
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:02,521
all on different flights
than her husband.

719
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,965
Doesn't make sense
they would travel
separately every time.

720
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:07,832
It does if you're
smuggling cocaine
in baby formula cans

721
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:09,804
and you wanna stay
under the radar.

722
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:11,738
Mother traveling with a baby.

723
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:14,675
Customs wouldn't have given
a couple of extra cans
of formula a second thought.

724
00:31:14,744 --> 00:31:16,302
No wonder she refused
our protection.

725
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:17,676
She's the mule,
not Derek.

726
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:18,907
But Derek's the one
that got whacked,

727
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:20,415
so he's gotta be in on it.

728
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:23,884
So question is,
did he or his company
arrange his business trips?

729
00:31:23,953 --> 00:31:26,478
Let's go ask his boss,
Keith Gerard.

730
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:28,783
I'II go with you.

731
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:34,124
He was servicing
a Mexican client,

732
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:35,824
billionaire entrepreneur
who's afraid to fly.

733
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:36,991
So we go to him.

734
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,556
Fax this to Chicago.
Yes, sir.

735
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:41,001
Do you usually send a guy
to your billionaire clients

736
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,197
who spends his day
making cold calls?

737
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:45,833
Look, Derek was
the company's scapegoat

738
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:47,501
against the bear market.

739
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:48,566
He shouldn't have Iost
his position,

740
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,340
so I tried
to throw him a bone.

741
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:52,278
You wanna tell me
what this has to do
with his death?

742
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:55,806
Derek was smuggling cocaine
on your time and your dime.

743
00:31:58,121 --> 00:31:59,554
Running drugs?
Are you kidding me?

744
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:01,351
AIong with his wife and son.

745
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:05,959
I knew it couldn't be true.
You're wrong.

746
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,291
BENSON: And why's that?

747
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:09,297
Derek and Laura
don't have any children.

748
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,766
If Tommy isn't
the Pfeiffers' child,

749
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:16,532
then who does he
belong to?

750
00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:18,130
Somebody who needs
the cash so bad

751
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:20,698
that they're willing
to rent their kid out
as a drug mule.

752
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:22,745
And Tommy,
or whatever his name is,

753
00:32:22,812 --> 00:32:24,336
he can't be the only one.

754
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:25,938
So you're thinking
whoever's running this

755
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:27,915
has a ring of mothers
with babies

756

bringing the coke in.

757
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:30,343
Well, it's gotta be.

758
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,355
Even if Laura Pfeiffer
brought in three cans
on each of her trips,

759
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:36,119
it's not enough of a profit
to warrant the risk.

760
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:37,216
We know where she is?

761
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:38,282
Yep.

762
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:40,929
She's staying
with her sister,

00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:39,718
It's okay.

782
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,154
Come here.

783
00:33:41,224 --> 00:33:42,691
(BENSON GASPS)

784
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:46,691
Come here. It's okay.

785
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:00,839
Neighbors hear anything?
FIN: Nada.

786
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,070
CSU found the pillow

787
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:03,806
the shooter used
to muffle the gunshots.

788
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,245
Any chance
this is Kendall's work?

789
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:06,474
Unless it's his ghost.

790
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:09,177
M.E. places time of death
at four to eight hours ago.

791
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:11,720
Well, somebody's cleaning up
the Ioose ends
Kendall Ieft behind.

792
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:12,982
If that had been
the cartel,

793
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:14,614
they would've
killed everybody
just to make a point,

794
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,952
including the baby.

795
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:18,926
Guys, Tommy
was Laura's nephew.

796
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,019
I found his birth certificate

797
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:21,859
in the dining room credenza
next to this.

798
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:23,831
PIane ticket
to Mexico perhaps?

799
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,889
Rio, one-way.

800
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:26,901
Probably so Laura
couldn't be extradited.

801
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,698
This guy's one
cold-blooded customer.

802
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:29,795
He killed
this baby's mother,

803
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:30,964
he'II do the same
to the others.

804
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,770
So we're on borrowed time,
and the perp's already
two steps ahead of us.

805
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:34,867
Call EIIiot.

806
00:34:34,944 --> 00:34:36,912
Have him start checking
every murder
in the Tri-State

807
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:38,003
since Kendall was killed.

808
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:41,073
We're Iooking
for any victims
with an infant.

809
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:43,843
Yeah. Got it.

810
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,778
Can you tell me
what time it happened?

811
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:47,152
Whacking mothers
with infants.

812
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:48,349
Right. Right.
Are you sure...

813
00:34:48,424 --> 00:34:49,755
Yeah, that's what I said.

814
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,316
Any children?
BENSON: Two victims.

815
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,918
No, I'm not kidding.
We think there's
gonna be more.

816
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:54,223
I'm not trying
to be difficult.

817
00:34:54,297 --> 00:34:55,491
Thanks a Iot.

818
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:57,089
Odafin Tutuola.

819
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,460
Tutuola. You need me
to spell it for you?
Come on.

820
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:02,333
Call me when you find out.
Thanks.

821
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:03,963
Got another one.

822
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,065
Where?
Mount Vernon.

823
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:07,336
Hooker.
Any kids?

824
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,139
They don't have that yet.

825
00:35:09,212 --> 00:35:10,406
What do you mean,
they don't have it?

826
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,005
Munch, I need information.

827
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:14,106
I'm stuck here.

828
00:35:14,183 --> 00:35:16,447
You guys are the ones
who are out there
trying to find this guy.

829
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,577
You think
I'm just gonna watch?

830
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:18,677
You need to take a break.

831
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:19,914
You should call
Mount Vernon back

832
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:22,685
and find out
if the victim had kids.

833
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,349
I brought you
some dinner.

834
00:35:25,428 --> 00:35:26,554
Now is not a good time.

835
00:35:26,629 --> 00:35:27,653
You've got to eat.

836
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,493
I gotta find this guy.

837
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:32,659
It's after midnight.
Come home, get some rest.

838
00:35:32,735 --> 00:35:34,202
Kathy, I can't Ieave.

839
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,467
OIivia, state police
just found Kendall's
sidekick Frank Barry.

840
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,768
STABLER:
Munch, wait a minute.

841
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:41,708
Hug the kids. I Iove you.
Thanks for dinner.

842
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:43,901
Where?

843
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,311
Body washed up
on Jones Beach.

844
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:47,975
Same MO?
One to the back
of the head.

845
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:52,279
OIivia, grab your coat,
we got another one. Queens.

846
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:04,993
Hey, Donny,
called your people

847
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:06,091
as soon
as it came in.

848
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:07,193
They're in
the Iiving room.

849
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,034
OIivia Benson,
Lieutenant Philly Panzaretti,
Queens Homicide.

850
00:36:10,106 --> 00:36:11,664
Hey, nice to meet you.
What've we got?

851
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:13,038
Two victims.

852
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:14,838
Francisco and BIanca FIores.

853
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,436
Lived here
with their Iittle girl,
eight months old.

854
00:36:17,513 --> 00:36:18,537
How's the baby?

855
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:19,740
Screaming when
patrol showed up,

856
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:21,077
but otherwise, okay.

857
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,516
EMS took her to EImhurst
to make sure.

858
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:26,419
CRAGEN: Shooter used a pillow
to muffle the gunshots.

859
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,889
Looks Iike the same MO
as the Staten Island murders.

860
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,653
Except the perp
broke into that house.

861
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:32,421
There's no sign
anyone forced
their way in here.

862
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:34,963
So, whoever it was,
the victim knew them.

863
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:36,464
Looks Iike somebody
worked from home.

864
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:37,794
Mr. FIores was a gardener.

865
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:40,233
His truck's parked out back.
Wife did his billing.

866
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:41,600
Judging from this place,

867
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,902
Mr. FIores wasn't
making any extra money
running drugs.

868
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:46,874
Or he just hasn't
spent it yet.

869
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:47,967
What'd you find?

870
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:50,205
An invoice made out
to Keith Gerard.

871
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:53,279
Mr. FIores
Iandscapes his house.

872
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,839
That's no coincidence.

873
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:56,942
He's running
this drug operation
from that brokerage house,

874
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:58,043
he's the top dog.

875
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,520
Renting babies from people
Iike Mr. and Mrs. FIores

876
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,558
who work for him
and need the money.

877
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,856
And now
he's gotta kill them all
so they can't finger him.

878
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:08,760
Detective Benson,
Captain Cragen.

879
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:10,458
We need to speak
to Mr. Gerard now.

880
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:11,591
I'm afraid
he stepped out.

881
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:12,691
Do you know
where he went?

882
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:15,498
He said he was going
to the corporate
daycare center.

883
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:16,595
Where is that?

884
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,299
Right downstairs
on the second floor.

885
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:19,363
What's going on here?

886
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:20,568
You Iisten.
Listen very carefully.

887
00:37:20,643 --> 00:37:22,668
If Gerard calls,
you do not tell him
we're here.

888
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:24,269
You got it?

889
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:44,021
There's Gerard.

890
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,761
With his next victim.

891
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,029
(SCREAMING)

892
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:48,595
Drop your weapon.

893
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:49,695
PIease don't hurt my baby.

894
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:51,171
Shut up.
Drop it.

895
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,004
Get back.
Get back now or she's dead.

896
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:55,338
It's over. It's over.

897
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:56,571
We can all walk away
from this.

898
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:58,238
I'm Ieaving the building
with her and the kid.

899
00:37:58,314 --> 00:38:00,339
CRAGEN: You're gonna have to
show us some good faith,

900
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,542
all right?

901
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:03,346
Just Iet them go.

902
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:05,718
Just Iet them go.

903
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:07,085
You're gonna watch her die.

904
00:38:07,156 --> 00:38:08,453
CRAGEN: This is between us.

905
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:09,616
What, you think
I'm an idiot?

906
00:38:09,692 --> 00:38:12,183
Just don't hurt them
and there's a way out.

907
00:38:12,261 --> 00:38:13,592
A way out?

908
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:17,632
Okay, all right,
Iook, Iet them go.

909
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,861
You can walk
out of here alone.

910
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:22,092
No cops?

911
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:23,160
No cops.

912
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:38,145
Get off,
you're hurting me.

913
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,687
Yeah. That's tough.

914
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:42,285
I can make you
both rich.

915
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:44,019
Yeah? You better save it
for the fancy Iawyer
you'II need

916
00:38:44,093 --> 00:38:46,152
to appeal
the death penalty.

917
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:54,694
D.A.'s office
isn't gonna drag you
before the grand jury,

918
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,533
and IAB cleared you.

919
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,640
In two days, how?

920
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:02,905
Incentive.

921
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:05,674
Spare themselves
the embarrassment
in the press.

922
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:14,051
What did it cost you?

923
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:17,152
Not nearly what it was worth.

924
00:39:22,298 --> 00:39:24,163
I'II see you tomorrow.

925
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,601
BENSON: Good night, Captain.

926
00:39:28,671 --> 00:39:29,729
How'd it go?

927
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:30,897
We got them all.

928
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:33,572
Ten other mothers.

929
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:37,444
Gerard paid
each mother 20 grand
to rent those babies.

930
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:39,976
Good job.

931
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,311
They making you
see the shrink?

932
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,818
Yeah.

933
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:45,046
You been there?

934
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:46,520
Not yet.

935
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:53,152
I thought I was okay, too,
when I shot that guy.

936
00:39:54,063 --> 00:39:56,463
But even a Iowlife
Iike Kendall's
gonna stay with you.

937
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:58,159
I gotta get home.

938
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:01,430
Thanks.

939
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:07,098
How Iong has that sandwich
been sitting there?

00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:08,541
I got busy. It's all yours.

941
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:09,669
You sleeping?

942
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:10,734
Yeah.

943
00:40:15,484 --> 00:40:17,918
Seeing that shrink,
did that help?

944
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:22,419
Not much.
