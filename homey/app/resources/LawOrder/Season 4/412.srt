00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:03,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:04,998
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:08,043
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:11,638
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:13,341
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:17,781
AII right,
I got the pick.
I got the pick.

8
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:19,446
Switch! Switch!

9
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:22,113
I got you.

10
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,419
What you got?
What you got?

11
00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:25,188
LYNN: Help me!

12
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,956
Help me!

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,055
Help me, please!

14
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:30,224
My God.

15
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:31,766
Help me!

16
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,768
Lynn, what's wrong?

17
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:35,201
He's not breathing.

18
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:36,898
My baby's not breathing.

19
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,736
Tuck, call 911.
AII right.

20
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:39,866
Hurry up!

21
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,000
Jawan!

22
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:42,476
Oh, my God!

23
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:45,070
(SOBBING)

24
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:47,480
Baby's name
is Jawan Hauser,
10 weeks old.

25
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,075
EMS brought him in
a couple of hours ago.

26
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:51,177
How's he doing?

27
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:53,119
On a respirator,
his pulse is weak.

28
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,747
Kid was probably
oxygen deprived.

29
00:00:54,824 --> 00:00:57,190
We won't know the extent
of the brain damage
until he wakes up,

30
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,352
if he ever does.

31
00:00:58,428 --> 00:00:59,588
We talking shaken baby?

32
00:00:59,662 --> 00:01:01,823
Body scan's negative
for healed fractures.

33
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:03,058
Head CT normal.

34
00:01:03,132 --> 00:01:05,066
No bruising
or retinal hemorrhaging.

35
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:07,295
So, you must have
brought us in here
for a reason.

36
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,803
I was concerned
when he came in.

37
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:11,669
EIevated heart rate,
shallow respirations,
dilated pupils.

38
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:13,231
Sounds Iike an OD.

39
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:15,800
You're right.
Tox screen's positive
for cocaine.

40
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:17,903
Someone doped this kid up.

41
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:09,597
Cocaine?

42
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:11,360
And you think
I gave it to my baby?

43
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:12,731
We're not jumping
to any conclusions.

44
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,326
Because I'm black,
Iive in the projects,

45
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:15,893
so I must be
doing drugs, right?

46
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:17,735
Why don't we calm down?
That's not what we're saying.

47
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:19,638
My mother was a junkie.

48
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,734
I never touched that dope
in my Iife.

49
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,608
I worked my ass off
cleaning houses

50
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,977
to keep me and Jawan
in that apartment.

51
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,885
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

52
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:37,119
I picked up Jawan
from his daycare after work,

53
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:38,751
brought him home.

54
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:41,228
I fed him,
but he wasn't very hungry

55
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:42,559
because he went
right to sleep,

56
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:44,327
so I put him
in his crib.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,494
When I checked on him,
he was hardly breathing.

58
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,935
Is Jawan dead?

59
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,632
No. No. No.

60
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:53,004
But the doctors say
that the cocaine Iooks Iike

61
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:54,872
it was mixed in
with the baby formula.

62
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:56,639
Oh, God.

63
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:58,373
How did that happen?

64
00:02:58,447 --> 00:02:59,539
Well, we need
to find out fast.

65
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:01,845
Where'd you buy
the formula?

66
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:02,942
At the store.

67
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,486
Which store?

68
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:07,513
I don't remember.

69
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,649
Lynn, you gotta
Iisten to me.

70
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:11,454
You do not want
to be responsible

71
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,859
for that poison being fed
to another baby.

72
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:18,792
It was my fault.
I borrowed it.

73
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:20,992
From the people
that you clean for?

74
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,197
I was short on money,
so I had to.

75
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:25,797
I swear, I was gonna
give it back.

76
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:28,643
Oh, my God.

77
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,544
You have to call them.
They have a 4-month-old boy.

78
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,618
Thank God
I got your message.

79
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,348
Tommy and I
just got back
from the park.

80
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:41,447
I was about to
feed him.

81
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:43,185
Baby Growth
is the brand we use,

82
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,521
but you said
someone poisoned it?

83
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:46,221
I can't believe
she would do
something Iike that.

84
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:48,160
Well, we can't take
any chances.

85
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:50,529
My God, if I had
given it to Tommy...

86
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,192
I keep all the formula
in here.

87
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:54,168
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
we're gonna need to do that.
Sorry.

88
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:55,761
Do you remember how many
cans you had Ieft?

89
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,635
Six. I buy it by the case.

90
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:58,901
BENSON: I count five.

91
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,465
Lynn must have taken
the missing can.

92
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:01,874
LAURA: I never noticed.

93
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:04,378
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
it's urgent that we know

94
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,779
where and when you bought
this baby formula.

95
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,976
My husband got it
a couple of days ago.

96
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:11,178
Gentry's Market on Columbus.

97
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:14,189
We took every can
of formula
off the shelves at Gentry's,

98
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:16,088
tested each one.
AII clear.

99
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:17,750
What about the ones
in Pfeiffer's pantry?

100
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:19,089
Four, perfectly
normal Iiquid,

101
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:20,253
and the other one
had the same chemistry

102
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,058
as the stuff fed
to Jawan Hauser.

103
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,655
Cocaine-Iaced
baby formula.

104
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:27,032
I wouldn't call it formula.
It's 90% pure Iiquid cocaine.

105
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:29,298
That purity probably came
from south of the border.

106
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:31,169
I've never seen it
smuggled this way before.

107
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,504
Take a Iook, solder plug.

108
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,770
That's where
they drained the formula

109
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:36,311
and refilled it
with Iiquid coke.

110
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,313
Seal it up,
glue the Iabel back on,

111
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:40,508
ship a couple of cases
to los Estados Unidos,

112
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,982
nobody's any the wiser.

113
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:43,848
They gotta have Iabs
on both sides
of the border

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,716
to turn it into Iiquid,
then back into powder.

115
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,585
And how'd this end up
on some store shelf?

116
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:50,751
I can't help you there,
but the manufacturer can.

117
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:53,294
Baby formula's closely
regulated by the FDA.

118
00:04:53,362 --> 00:04:55,592
Each can has a Iot number
and expiration date on top.

119
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:58,828
You can find out
where it was made
and purchased.

120
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,925
I called the FDA.

121
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:02,732
They're gonna issue
a CIass I recall,
highest priority.

122
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:05,399
AII the FDA can do
is ask the company
to pull the product.

123
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:07,271
Not when it involves
infant formula.

124
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:09,573
Then they have the authority.
How're we doing?

125
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,772
Every can of Baby Growth
in the market

126
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:13,405
and every clean can
at the Pfeiffers'

127
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:15,211
was made
at the Atlanta plant.

128
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:16,546
And the two bad cans?

129
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,950
Lot numbers
weren't even close.

130
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,282
Why? Because
they were manufactured

131
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:22,347
at the Baby Growth plant
in Mexico. Juárez.

132
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,052
Cartel country.

133
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:26,026
So, our friends
get it down there,

134
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:28,893
replace the Spanish
Ianguage Iabels
with ones in English,

135
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:30,158
and then they smuggle it
up here.

136
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:32,427
Yeah, the question is
how did those two cans
from Mexico

137
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,763
end up in
the Pfeiffers' closet?

138
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,269
Well, what do we know
about the Pfeiffers?

139
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:38,068
She's home with the baby.
The husband's name is Derek.

140
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,129
He's a stockbroker,

141
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,075
works at a firm
called Chandler Hinton
down on Wall Street.

142
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:43,236
Well, that wouldn't be
the first time

143
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:44,870
some big shot,
hard up for cash,

144
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:47,006
moonlighted in
the drug biz.

145
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,574
Derek Pfeiffer sounds
Iike our perfect candidate.

146
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:50,846
Credit report in the dumper.

147
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,218
Filing for bankruptcy
when he miraculously erases

148
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,257
$300,000 in debt.

149
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,951
Sudden windfall?
Benson.

150
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:59,290
Yeah, Iike the kind you get
from a big drug shipment.

151
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:00,852
Who says crime doesn't pay?

152
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,022
Yeah.

153
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:05,130
That was the hospital.

154
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:07,726
Jawan Hauser died
a half-hour ago.

155
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:09,566
That's depraved
indifference murder

156
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:12,698
for whoever smuggled that coke
in those formula cans.

157
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:13,833
Go talk to Pfeiffer.

158
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:17,208
If you don't Iike
what he has to say,
bring him in.

159
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:25,083
I really appreciate
you guys getting that stuff
out of my house

160
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,314
before something bad
happened.

161
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,654
That's no problem.
We just gotta figure out
how it got in your house.

162
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:31,352
That's easy.
I bought it.

163
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:34,555
Problem is, there
wasn't another bad
can in that store,

164
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,495
which means
the only two cans
of Iiquid cocaine

165
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:39,466
on the Upper West Side
were in your pantry.

166
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,104
I wish
I could help you guys.

167
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:44,833
MUNCH: Take any trips
out of the country
Iately, Derek?

168
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:47,273
Say, Iike, down Mexico way?

169
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:49,642
I have clients
all over the world.

170
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:52,875
That's okay,
you don't have to tell us.
We can check with Customs.

171
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:59,309
I just got back
from Mexico City
on company business.

172
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:02,618
Look, it's not good
for me to be seen here

173
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:04,249
talking to you guys
Iike this in the office.

174
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:05,816
What a coincidence.
We were gonna suggest

175
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:06,953
that you come down
to our office

176
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,553
and continue
this discussion.

177
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:10,592
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

178
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,826
Sure you are.

179
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:15,268
Or you'II be seen
wearing steel when we
drag you out of here.

180
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,128
Is this really necessary?

181
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,072
I have five client meetings
this afternoon.

182
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:22,337
Believe me,
that's the Ieast
of your problems.

183
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:23,969
STABLER: Uh-oh.

184
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,070
What's the matter?

185
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:26,239
I smell a rat.

186
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,441
Big time.

187
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:30,349
Sergeant Tucker, to what
do we owe this visit
from Internal Affairs?

188
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,478
FIN: Don't forget to salute
or you'II get a 30-day rip.

189
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:33,544
What are you doing?

190
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,249
Standing here
talking to a friend.

191
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,416
His name Derek Pfeiffer?

192
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:37,516
What's it to you?

193
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,322
Mr. Pfeiffer's
coming with me.

194
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:40,692
We got a dead kid
on our hands.

195
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:42,526
That baby is no Ionger
your concern.

196
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:44,122
Narcotics dime us?

197
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,134
AII you need to know
is your captain
signed off on it.

198
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:47,794
Mr. Pfeiffer, my name
is Sergeant Tucker.

199
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,202
You need to come
with me, sir.

200
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,274
Our captain told you
where we were?

201
00:07:58,113 --> 00:07:59,478
What's the deal
with Tucker?

202
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:00,776
Sergeant Tucker
from IAB?

203
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,839
Yeah, did you send him?

204
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,817
Send him?
What's going on here?
Where's Pfeiffer?

205
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:05,183
Tucker took him
right out
of our hands.

206
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:07,119
Said he had your okay.

207
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,785
Let's take a ride.

208
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,320
Captain Cragen,
Detective Stabler.
How can I help you?

209
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:16,057
You Iying son of a bitch.

210
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:18,224
Now, it's not enough
you go behind my back
to steal our case.

211
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,200
Now you want my people
thinking I'm in your pocket.

212
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,736
Get off me now.

213
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:22,896
You don't need
what he can do to you.

214
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:24,599
Just relax.

215
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:27,799
I should Iock you up.

216
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,572
Do it. Then explain it
to your bosses.

217
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,203
You need anger
management, Captain.

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,009
And you need to kiss my ass.

219
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:34,049
Where's Derek Pfeiffer?

220
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,447
We questioned him
and Iet him go.

221
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:36,883
He's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

222
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:38,544
Any of your people
go near him,

223
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:39,918
and you'II go
before a trial board.

224
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:41,149
Good, and then
you can explain

225
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:43,191
why an infant died
on your watch.

226
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,726
I want to know
what the hell's
going on here.

227
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:46,556
I don't have to
tell you squat.

228
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,722
IAB investigating
means a dirty cop's
involved.

229
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:49,786
I want a name.

230
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:50,854
Go to hell.

231
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,062
So, now what's
our next move?

232
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:58,003
Pick up Derek Pfeiffer.

233
00:08:58,073 --> 00:08:59,631
You really wanna
take on IAB?

234
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,471
Tucker doesn't tell us
how to do our jobs.

235
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:04,707
Look, EIIiot,
you're following an order
from your CO.

236
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,408
If it gets ugly,
that's what you tell them.

237
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:10,509
If we hurry,
we can catch Pfeiffer
just Ieaving work.

238
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,719
Hey, Special Victims,
what's up?

239
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,848
Came in as a 34.

240
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:18,189
Suit, not breathing,
in a bathroom
on the 20th floor.

241
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,421
That's where Pfeiffer works.

242
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,605
BENSON: Damn it.
It's Pfeiffer.

243
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:39,339
Somebody beat us to him.

244
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,478
MUNCH: Whoever killed Pfeiffer
must've followed him in

245
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:46,316
and got him
before he closed
the stall door.

246
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:47,446
Cable he was
strangled with

247
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:49,354
could've came
from any office
in this building.

248
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,518
Perp could've
brought it in to
make it Iook that way.

249
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,084
This is Keith Gerard.

250
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:55,289
He's Mr. Pfeiffer's
immediate boss.

251
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:56,922
Detectives Munch
and Tutuola.

252
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:58,057
Sorry for your Ioss.

253
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,725
I don't know
how this happens
in a business Iike this.

254
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:01,702
Building's been
Iocked down tight
since 9/11,

255
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,204
all visitors signed in
and escorted by security.

256
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:06,764
Probably 10 other ways
to get in,
nothing's foolproof.

257
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:08,833
Possible one
of Pfeiffer's clients
had it in for him?

258
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:10,469
If Iosing money
were enough
to set someone off,

259
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:11,706
we'd all be dead by now.

260
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,077
Derek's desk. Feel free.

261
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:14,672
Anything unusual about
his behavior Iately?

262
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,445
Derek was under
a Iot of stress.

263
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:17,951
You mean because of
the market going south?

264
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,612
No, I mean he got demoted.

265
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:20,677
What happened?

266
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:22,383
His biggest accounts
Iost millions.

267
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,551
The investors
called for his head
and they got it.

268
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:25,753
He used to run the floor.

269
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:27,022
And then
you stepped in.

270
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:29,121
Believe me, that's not
how I wanted it to happen.

271
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:30,187
You mind telling us
where you've been

272
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:31,562
for the Iast
couple of hours?

273
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,295
Sure. Meeting with
the managing partners.

274
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:34,461
Well, we're gonna
need their names

275
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:36,060
and a Iist
of Pfeiffer's accounts.

276
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,231
I'II have my assistant
get it for you.

277
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,472
This has gotta be a hit.

278
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:44,876
They knew Pfeiffer
was talking to us
and they shut him up.

279
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,472
That means his wife's
a target, too.

280
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:51,316
Derek never would have
been involved with drugs.

281
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,048
We think that
your husband smuggled in

282
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:54,646
the baby formula
from Mexico.

283
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:56,350
No, you're wrong.

284
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:59,189
Did you know your husband
was demoted at work?

285
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:00,417
No.

286
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:03,158
Did you know
he filed for bankruptcy?

287
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,566
I knew we were in debt,

288
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,068
but Derek said
he paid everything off.

289
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:13,369
Bonus for closing
a big deal, he told me.

290
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:15,369
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
did your husband

291
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:17,674
ever talk to you
about work?

292
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:21,045
No, he said he didn't want
to bring the job home

293
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:23,676
because he worked
so many hours.

294
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:26,448
Are all those hours
at the office?

295
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,752
He used to entertain clients,

296
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:32,123
three nights a week,
at the Bear and Bull.

297
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:34,594
Did you ever meet
any of his
business associates?

298
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:38,360
No, I told you,
Derek didn't want us
in that world.

299
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:40,368
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

300
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:43,200
Mrs. Pfeiffer, if your
husband was murdered

301
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:45,001
because of his
involvement with drugs,

302
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:48,009
the people who
killed him may think
you know something.

303
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:50,204
Oh, my God.

304
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,747
Are you telling me
Tommy and I are in danger?

305
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:55,249
Two detectives are
on their way over here.

306
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:57,285
They're gonna stay with you.
It's for your own safety.

307
00:11:57,352 --> 00:11:58,376
No.

308
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,146
No, we'II go to
my sister's.

309
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:03,418
I'II feel more
comfortable there.

310
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:05,823
Has somebody
threatened you?

311
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:09,253
Mrs. Pfeiffer?

312
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:18,372
After you were here,
a man knocked on the door.

313
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:22,035
Said Derek sent him
to pick up the formula.

314
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,306
I told him
I gave it to you,

315
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,506
and he got really upset.

316
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:28,812
I asked him how he got
past the doorman,

317
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:32,149
and he showed me his badge.

318
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:36,752
It's an IAB operation,

319
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,816
and I warned you
to back off.

320
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:39,883
Your detectives...

321
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,327
Were following my orders.

322
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,091
Now who else at IAB
was in on this?

323
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:45,099
Don't even try
and pin this on me here.

324
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,193
Only five people
in this squad
knew about this case.

325
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,637
Three of us are here,
and the other two
are cleaning up your mess.

326
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:53,106
Now, I still got
a few friends on this job

327
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:55,268
who wear stars
on their shoulders.

328
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:58,336
You wanna tell them
how this went down,
or should I?

329
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:02,214
Twice, over the Iast year,

330
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:05,583
Narcotics tried to infiltrate
your baby formula
cocaine ring.

331
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,383
Undercovers got made
both times.

332
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:08,923
By your dirty cop.

333
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,253
Narcotics thought
it was one of theirs.

334
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:11,849
That's why they
turned it over to us.

335
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:13,394
BENSON: And you have
no idea who it is?

336
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:14,554
We're not sure.

337
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,860
You're not sure
about much, are you?

338
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,661
You know, our D.A.
could've made a deal
with Pfeiffer

339
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:19,826
to give up your dirty cop

340
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,494
if you hadn't crapped
all over our case.

341
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,060
It's our case, Detective.

342
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:24,162
Not anymore.

343
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,106
Your people can't handle
this kind of work.

344
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:29,838
My people do
this kind of work every day.

345
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:31,675
A baby died
of cocaine poisoning,

346
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:34,147
and we're damn well
gonna find out
who's responsible.

347
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,205
Now, you wanna help us, fine,

348
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:37,878
otherwise get the hell
out of our way.

349
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,117
AII right.

350
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:43,851
What do you need?

351
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:48,053
Fake IDs, vehicles,
drugs and buy money,
for starters.

352
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,995
You don't make a move
without telling me.

353
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,200
Checked everyone
on the security Iog
at Chandler Hinton.

354
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:02,437
AII visitors accounted for
and nothing useful
from the canvass.

355
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:04,035
Pfeiffer's phone records
any help?

356
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,773
Well, the only thing
that stands out

357
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:08,078
is that whenever Pfeiffer
was at the Bear and Bull,

358
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,846
he always called home
from a pay phone instead
of using his cell.

359
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,318
Sounds Iike
he doesn't want
anyone to know

360
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:13,581
who else he's calling.

361
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:14,713
CIassic paranoia.

362
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,985
Could be where he does
his other business.

363
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,321
Hey, there's plenty
of drug activity

364
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:20,827
down at some of those joints
in the financial district.

365
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,761
Coke to fuel
the high stress jobs.

366
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:24,992
You're the one with
undercover experience.

367
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,160
I go Iooking to score
in one of them
Wall Street bars,

368
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:29,466
I might as well
put a sign on my back
that says "cop."

369
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:33,668
But EIIiot here,
he Iooks Iike the clean-cut
corporate type.

370
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,642
Well, if that's
a compliment,
I'm game.

371
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:37,542
AII right.
OIivia and Fin
will ghost you.

372
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,637
Munch and I
are backups.

373
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:40,272
We need to get you
a cover story.

374
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:42,078
Baby formula scheme's
down the toilet,

375
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,710
so they're gonna be
Iooking for a new way
to bring in the product.

376
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:46,413
You wanna get
their attention real fast,

377
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:48,479
you gotta be the solution.

378
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:50,491
And I gotta be
vulnerable.

379
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,292
Never flash
your buy money.

380
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:56,160
If they offer to buy,
you know the test.

381
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,559
Snow seals.

382
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:00,261
There's a quarter gram
of coke in each one.

383
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:01,996
And take this.

384
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,367
What are you gonna do,
page me?

385
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:05,929
It's a wire.
If they frisk you,
they'II never suspect it.

386
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,635
Got it from a buddy
in TARU.

387
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:08,903
We got backup inside.

388
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:10,945
I'II be out here
recording. Cool?

389
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:13,306
Yeah.

390
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:20,187
(SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

391
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:25,086
How's it going?

392
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,252
What can I get you?

393
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:27,920
Give me a beer,
that Iast one on the end,

394
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,624
and give the Iady
whatever she's having.

395
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:31,893
BARTENDER:
Scotch on the rocks?

396
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:32,991
Yeah.

397
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:34,057
You got it.

398
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,160
Thank you.

399
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:37,205
You're welcome.
How you doing?

400
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:38,705
I'm not bad.
How are you?

401
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:40,897
Better now.

402
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:43,843
BARTENDER: Here we go.
That'II be 12 bucks.

403
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,773
(LAUGHS)
Sorry about that.

404
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:51,446
(CHUCKLING)

405
00:15:53,488 --> 00:15:54,978
That any good?

406
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:55,052
I'II tell you what,
why don't you
just take a Iittle taste

407
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,388
and you tell me?

408
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:59,624
I can turn you on
to something
a Iittle fresher.

409
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:01,765
Have a taste.

410
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:04,028
What's your name?

411
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:05,965
Donna.

412
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,973
He's talking to somebody
at the end of the bar.

413
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,236
Probably the resident dealer.

414
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:17,210
And he's coming back.

415
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:20,912
I'm good. That's for you.

416
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:24,513
Gentleman down
the end of the bar
would Iike a word with you.

417
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,384
He interested?

418
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,449
Says he'II make it
worth your while.

419
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:42,604
He's following some guy
into the bathroom.

420
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:47,870
Whoa.

421
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:51,648
This your idea
of a conversation?

422
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:54,014
You trying to sell
this crap on my turf?

423
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:55,109
Who the hell are you?

424
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,175
Who am I?
Yeah.

425
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:57,846
I'm the guy whose spot
you're parked in.

426
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:00,857
And I gotta tell you, pal,
I don't Iike competition,
okay?

427
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:02,722
Wait a minute.
This guy said
you were interested.

428
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,694
This is a big
misunderstanding.

429
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,288
Hey, I don't want
a problem here,
man, really.

430
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,526
So, what's your name?

431
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:10,727
Here.

432
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:14,970
Greg EIIiot.

433
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:18,604
So, Greg, where are you
serving out of?

434
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,104
Building where my office is.

435
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:24,808
And how much?
How much...

436
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:26,874
How much quantity?

437
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:31,178
Three hundred grams
every two weeks, about.

438
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,591
That's... That's impressive.

439
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:35,648
Yeah.

440
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:36,751
What are you paying
your supplier?

441
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:37,852
Ninety.

442
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,021
Ninety.

443
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:42,565
I'II tell you, Greg,
my people could do better.

444
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:46,037
My customers Iike
what they're getting.

445
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:48,538
The stuff I got,
it's top quality.

446
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:52,639
Okay, I'm Iistening.

447
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,938
Good. Good.

448
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:58,881
Why don't you meet me
tonight at the entrance
to the seaport, say, 8:00?

449
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:03,477
And bring your money.

450
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,127
Who's he?

451
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,563
Shut up.

452
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,834
Nice to meet you, too.

453
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:25,307
He's clean.

454
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,545
Still didn't answer
my question.

455
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:32,683
You got the money?

456
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,876
Wow!

457
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:37,851
Wow, you wanna show me
the product?

458
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:03,146
It's a Iittle better
than mine.

459
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:05,876
Seventy a gram,
introductory offer.

460
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,349
Then we renegotiate.

461
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:09,477
No, you gotta do
better than that.

462
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:12,318
Why don't you taste it?

463
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,915
Taste it, because they do
random drug tests
where I work.

464
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:15,982
I don't do this stuff.

465
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,925
AII right.
AII right. AII right.

466
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,226
Seventy a gram.
Permanent price.

467
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:22,762
Permanent price. Done.

468
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,808
Hey. Hey.
Take the money.

469
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:33,309
What're you doing?

470
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:34,402
You guys, Iook. Hey.

471
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,741
He's got a gun,
Captain.

472
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,371
FIN: Wait a minute.

473
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,574
Everybody, hang tight.

474
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,311
Show me a badge.

475
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,611
Oh.

476
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:43,711
He's got a gold shield.

477
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,585
STABLER: Look, guys,
Iet's talk about this.

478
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:47,557
Now he's got
EIIiot's wallet.

479
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,355
What do you say?
You gonna read me
my rights?

480
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:52,521
You don't got
any rights.

481
00:19:57,235 --> 00:19:59,965
Well, I guess we just
found our dirty cop.

482
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:12,571
This doesn't Iook
Iike any police station
I've ever seen.

483
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,982
You think
I'm gonna do business
with some dumbass punk?

484
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,042
Are we just gonna
sit here

485
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,382
while they beat
the crap out of him?

486
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:19,252
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd be dead by now.

487
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:20,723
What is this?
Some sort of initiation?

488
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,488
The guy with the shield
just wants to show
he's the alpha dog,

489
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:25,586
to mark his spot.

490
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:27,028
Your call, Captain.

491
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,430
You see a gun come out,
move. Don't wait.

492
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:35,765
I hope you didn't
bring me here
just to kick my ass.

493
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,868
Gregory EIIiot,
married, four kids,
house in Forest Hills.

494
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,370
You still got
that gambling problem,
Greg?

495
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,779
What's that?
Your homework assignment?

496
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:53,518
Director of Station Operations
for GIobal Package Express.

497
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,580
What's that mean?

498
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,219
I run our worldwide
shipping stations.

499
00:20:57,295 --> 00:21:00,389
What are you doing?
Putting together my résumé?

500
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:01,693
Must be
a Iot of travel.

501
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,461
Yeah, I do my share.

502
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:06,594
I think you're just
the guy we're Iooking for.

503
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:10,736
Guys, I just sell the stuff,
small quantities.

504
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:11,866
I don't move it.

505
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:13,035
You do now.

506
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:15,102
I'm telling you,
I'm selling this

507
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,147
for an old friend of mine,
that's it.

508
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:19,206
You want Ioyalty,
get a puppy.

509
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:22,344
I got you with enough blow
for an A-1 felony.

510
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,388
That's Iife
without parole.

511
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:26,150
You don't think my company
doesn't have safeguards

512
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:28,021
to prevent people
from doing this sort of thing?

513
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:29,719
Then you're gonna have to
think outside the box,

514
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:31,785
Iike they teach you
in business school.

515
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:34,263
You got till
tomorrow to decide.

516
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,328
Phone number's
on there.

517
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:37,527
Who's answering?

518
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,431
Call me Kendall.
Oh, one more thing.

519
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:41,494
Yeah.

520
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,669
That's for the attitude.

521
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:51,678
Can I have
my wallet?

522
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:03,590
How's the patient?

523
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:05,185
Couple of scratches.
He'II Iive.

524
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:06,560
CRAGEN: What'd you find out?

525
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,428
Brad Kendall's
got 13 years on the job,

526
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:09,989
nine in Manhattan Narcotics.

527
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:12,434
He's got more decorations
than you can hang
on a Christmas tree.

528
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,767
Sounds Iike he was
a good cop once.

529
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,136
Nothing Iower
than a commendation,

530
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:17,572
even got a combat cross.

531
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:19,576
MUNCH: He walked in
on a gas station robbery,

532
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:21,077
perps shot at him
and missed.

533
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:22,237
He killed them both.

534
00:22:22,313 --> 00:22:24,440
Decade of watching
drug dealers
make the big bucks,

535
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:25,982
guess he wanted
a piece of the action.

536
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,848
If I had went Kendall's route,
I could've been
a rich man by now.

537
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,820
He matches
Laura Pfeiffer's description

538
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:33,288
of a cop who came Iooking
for baby formula.

539
00:22:33,358 --> 00:22:35,952
We know if Kendall
ever made an appearance
there before?

540
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,324
I spoke to all the doormen
in the building.

541
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:39,056
It was only that one time.

542
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,496
Which means Pfeiffer
normally delivered
the cocaine to him.

543
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:42,897
Probably at
the Bear and Bull.

544
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,559
Okay, what about
Kendall's butt boy?

545
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:46,034
Frank Barry.

546
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:49,596
Thirty. In and out of prison
on a string of drug collars,

547
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:51,471
mostly for possession.

548
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,976
Never carried enough weight
to be charged
with intent to sell.

549
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:55,478
Well, he and Kendall
are soldiers.

550
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:58,481
There's no way they got
the brains or the muscle
to run an operation Iike this.

551
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,710
We don't even know
how big this thing is.

552
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:03,310
But there's no way
that Pfeiffer's
their only mule.

553
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:04,912
Well, Kendall
gave you 24 hours.

554
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:06,684
That means he's hard up
for product.

555
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:07,850
If he doesn't
get some soon,

556
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:11,088
the people that buy
from him are gonna cop
from somebody else.

557
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:12,924
Get back to Kendall.

558
00:23:12,997 --> 00:23:15,591
Turn up the heat this time,
but meet in a public place.

559
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,759
We don't want
a rerun of tonight.

560
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:30,509
Why here?

561
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:34,442
This is where
I do business.

562
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,716
You know, I don't remember
us talking money

563
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:39,689
while you were
kicking my ass.

564
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:42,317
I'm Ietting you
stay out of jail.

565
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:44,623
There's nothing
to talk about.

566
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:50,098
Oh, no?
Well, what's to stop me
from going to the cops

567
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:52,568
and telling them
you're shaking me down?

568
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:55,462
I'm a hero cop.

569
00:23:56,374 --> 00:23:58,001
I mean, who do you think
they're gonna believe?

570
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:01,010
Then you must think
I am some dumbass punk, huh?

571
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,271
You know what I think?

572
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,108
You're trying
to stay in business.

573
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:08,784
What, you got
a crystal ball or something?

574
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:12,311
You need me so bad
you're blackmailing me
to work for you.

575
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,790
That smells
of desperation to me.

576
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,560
I'II tell you what,
hero cop, you're right.

577
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:19,653
Lock me up.

578
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:24,961
What do you want?

579
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:27,334
A third of the profits
of whatever I ship,

580
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:29,771
after you tell me
why I'm the answer
to your problems.

581
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:31,741
What's the difference?
It's business.

582
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:34,778
I don't do business
with Iiars or screw-ups.

583
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:40,677
(CHUCKLES)

584
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:42,844
I'II take it to my people.

585
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,909
I don't know
what that means.

586
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:45,512
What does that mean,
take it to your people?

587
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,387
What, you can't close
the deal?

588
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,450
I mean, doesn't sound
Iike you're very high up
in the food chain.

589
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:53,053
Maybe I should be talking
to someone who has
a Iittle more juice.

590
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,223
No, you're dealing with me.

591
00:24:58,603 --> 00:24:59,695
Okay.

592
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,469
Have it your way.
You go "talk to your people."

593
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,905
See if they can afford me,

594
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:07,376
and I'II Iet you know
of my decision.

595
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:11,538
Try the veal,
it's great.

596
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:20,154
Okay, I'II call you back
with the details.

597
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:25,958
What do they want you
to do?

598
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,998
Bring in 10 boxes
of terracotta tiles

599
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:29,532
made of cocaine base.

600
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,569
Four kilos per box,
each worth $80,000.

601
00:25:32,637 --> 00:25:35,765
My cover story,
I'm retiling my kitchen.

602
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,307
Where's it coming from?

603
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,433
Mexico City.

604
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:42,712
Gotta find a reason
to get me on down there.

605
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,714
Mexico's a Iittle
out of our jurisdiction.

606
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:47,250
Not to mention,
out of our Ieague.

607
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:49,946
Okay, you tell Kendall

608
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:51,818
you can't make the trip
on such short notice

609
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:53,220
without arousing suspicion.

610
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,260
Somebody in Mexico City
will make the pickup for you.

611
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:56,954
Where's the drop?

612
00:25:57,763 --> 00:26:00,357
My alter ego's house
in Forest Hills.

613
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,464
Delivery company
drops off the tiles,

614
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:04,092
Kendall will come
and pick them up.

615
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:06,296
We'II have to involve DEA.

616
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:07,497
They can get us
a cover house

617
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:09,234
and handle
the pickup in Mexico.

618
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:12,106
Kendall could be working
with DEA people.

619
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:16,108
Well, that's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

620
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:25,821
That's the Iast one, sir.

621
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:27,415
Thanks a Iot.

622
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:45,672
This is the most
we've been able
to bring in at one time.

623
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:47,678
I guess you're saying
you're a satisfied
customer then.

624
00:26:47,746 --> 00:26:50,306
That'II be $267,000.

625
00:26:50,382 --> 00:26:52,111
You wanna count it?

626
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:55,183
I don't know. Do I need to?

627
00:26:56,655 --> 00:26:58,282
Now Iet's move these.

628
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:02,385
Honey, are those the tiles?

629
00:27:03,895 --> 00:27:06,227
No, it's a mistake.

630
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:08,528
They're the wrong ones.
This guy's gonna
exchange them.

631
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,034
He's got ours in his van.
Hey, this is my wife Dana.

632
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:12,434
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

633
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:13,801
Baby, you gotta get
in the shower.

634
00:27:13,872 --> 00:27:15,737
We have to be
at Vanessa and GIen's
in Iess than two hours.

635
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:17,297
Oh, are these the tiles?
STABLER: I don't want to go...

636
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,742
Hey, hey, hey.
What's he doing back here?

637
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,479
Yo, I must've
not signed for it.
He must've made a mistake.

638
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:24,708
I'II deal with this.

639
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:26,444
KENDALL: Son of a bitch.

640
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:28,114
Back off!

641
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:35,557
Police, Kendall, freeze!

642
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:37,959
Freeze! Drop the gun!

643
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,622
Drop your gun.

644
00:27:39,698 --> 00:27:41,757
Drop your gun.
Drop your gun!

645
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,198
Drop it!

646
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:53,034
Drop the...

647
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:00,980
You okay?
Call the bus.

648
00:28:01,053 --> 00:28:03,749
FIN: 10-13, Manhattan SVU.
We got an officer shot.

649
00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:08,384
We're at 6432 99th Street,
Forest Hills, send a bus.

650
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,722
What happened?
He turned around.

651
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:11,319
I had no choice.
The son of a bitch
just turned on me.

652
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:12,420
Okay.
He turned on me.

653
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:13,725
Okay. Take it easy.
He turned on me.

654
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,232
I had no choice.

655
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,528
He wanted me to shoot him.

656
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,967
Son of a bitch
wanted me to shoot him.

657
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:23,236
Why'd he make me do that?
Why?

658
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:26,569
He didn't have the guts
to do it himself.

659
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:31,707
EIIiot, I need your gun.

660
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,410
I know the drill.

661
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,368
STABLER: Upon realizing
he was the target

662
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:51,766
of our sting operation,

663
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:53,668
Detective Kendall
pulled his weapon

664
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:55,764
on Detective Benson
and myself.

665
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:56,830
What happened next?

666
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,136
He ran. I followed.

667
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,370
AIone?

668
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:01,745
Detective Benson
wasn't armed.

669
00:29:01,813 --> 00:29:04,304
Undercover operation,
it was her call.

670
00:29:04,382 --> 00:29:05,849
But you were armed.
My call.

671
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,384
I didn't trust Kendall.

672
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:09,579
Are you sure you don't want
your union delegate here?

673
00:29:09,654 --> 00:29:10,678
I've got nothing to hide.

674
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:13,224
Now how many more times
are we gonna go over this?

675
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:16,351
Detective Kendall
never fired his weapon,
but you did.

676
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:20,490
After I identified myself
as a police officer

677
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:23,193
and ordered Detective Kendall
to drop his weapon,

678
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:25,259
he turned
and pointed it at me.

679
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:27,464
Just Iike I told you before.

680
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:30,904
And how many times
did you fire your weapon?

681
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:32,034
Two.

682
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:35,472
Because you saw him
raise his weapon.

683
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:38,414
To shoot me.

684
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:42,376
There's nothing else
I could've done.

685
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:50,056
I'm officially notifying you
you're on modified assignment,

686
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:54,292
restricted to your office
until our investigation
is completed.

687
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:55,492
You're not to make
any arrests

688
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:58,161
or interrogate any suspects
until then.

689
00:29:58,236 --> 00:30:00,227
Is that clear, Detective?

690
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:07,938
The bastard makes me
shoot him,

691
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:09,480
and I'm the one
under investigation.

692
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:11,482
EIIiot, maybe you ought to
take a few vacation days.

693
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,518
Not until I find out
who bankrolled Kendall.

694
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:15,485
I killed him,
I killed our only Iead.

695
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:17,181
EIIiot, the Iab found
dandruff flakes

696
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:19,849
on the computer cable
used to strangle
Derek Pfeiffer.

697
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,654
Matches Kendall's DNA.

698
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:24,422
So Kendall whacked Pfeiffer
to shut him up,

699
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:26,361
probably on orders
from the top.

700
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:28,922
With Kendall gone,
we may never find out
who that is.

701
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,525
Well, Kendall
arranged that shipment
of tiles somehow.

702
00:30:31,603 --> 00:30:33,127
Anything on the phones?

703
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:34,729
Just a few Iocal calls
to family members.

704
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:35,830
Nothing suspicious.

705
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:38,671
We also took
a prepaid cell off him,
untraceable.

706
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:40,370
What about his gofer,
Frank Barry?

707
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:42,572
We haven't found him yet,
but he's too Iow
on the totem pole

708
00:30:42,647 --> 00:30:44,547
to have access
to the top guy.

709
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:46,447
Maybe Laura Pfeiffer
can fill in the blanks.

710
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:47,576
BENSON: How?

711
00:30:47,652 --> 00:30:49,210
We found the bad formula
in her kitchen,

712
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:51,278
we're thinking
Derek brought it in.

713
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:52,345
But when I called customs

714
00:30:52,424 --> 00:30:51,721
to check on his trips
to Mexico,

715
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,487
we found out
she traveled there, too.

716
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,584
When?

717
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:56,925
In the Iast three weeks,
five round trips
with her baby,

718
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:58,521
all on different flights
than her husband.

719
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,965
Doesn't make sense
they would travel
separately every time.

720
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:03,832
It does if you're
smuggling cocaine
in baby formula cans

721
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,804
and you wanna stay
under the radar.

722
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:07,738
Mother traveling with a baby.

723
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:10,675
Customs wouldn't have given
a couple of extra cans
of formula a second thought.

724
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,302
No wonder she refused
our protection.

725
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:13,676
She's the mule,
not Derek.

726
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,907
But Derek's the one
that got whacked,

727
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:16,415
so he's gotta be in on it.

728
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:19,884
So question is,
did he or his company
arrange his business trips?

729
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:22,478
Let's go ask his boss,
Keith Gerard.

730
00:31:23,156 --> 00:31:24,783
I'II go with you.

731
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:30,124
He was servicing
a Mexican client,

732
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:31,824
billionaire entrepreneur
who's afraid to fly.

733
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:32,991
So we go to him.

734
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,556
Fax this to Chicago.
Yes, sir.

735
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:37,001
Do you usually send a guy
to your billionaire clients

736
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,197
who spends his day
making cold calls?

737
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,833
Look, Derek was
the company's scapegoat

738
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:43,501
against the bear market.

739
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:44,566
He shouldn't have Iost
his position,

740
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:46,340
so I tried
to throw him a bone.

741
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:48,278
You wanna tell me
what this has to do
with his death?

742
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:51,806
Derek was smuggling cocaine
on your time and your dime.

743
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,554
Running drugs?
Are you kidding me?

744
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,351
AIong with his wife and son.

745
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,959
I knew it couldn't be true.
You're wrong.

746
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:03,291
BENSON: And why's that?

747
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:05,297
Derek and Laura
don't have any children.

748
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,766
If Tommy isn't
the Pfeiffers' child,

749
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:12,532
then who does he
belong to?

750
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:14,130
Somebody who needs
the cash so bad

751
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,698
that they're willing
to rent their kid out
as a drug mule.

752
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:18,745
And Tommy,
or whatever his name is,

753
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,336
he can't be the only one.

754
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:21,938
So you're thinking
whoever's running this

755
00:32:22,015 --> 00:32:23,915
has a ring of mothers
with babies

756

bringing the coke in.

757
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:26,343
Well, it's gotta be.

758
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,355
Even if Laura Pfeiffer
brought in three cans
on each of her trips,

759
00:32:29,423 --> 00:32:32,119
it's not enough of a profit
to warrant the risk.

760
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:33,216
We know where she is?

761
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:34,282
Yep.

762
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,929
She's staying
with her sister,

00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:35,718
It's okay.

782
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:37,154
Come here.

783
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,691
(BENSON GASPS)

784
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,691
Come here. It's okay.

785
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:56,839
Neighbors hear anything?
FIN: Nada.

786
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,070
CSU found the pillow

787
00:33:58,145 --> 00:33:59,806
the shooter used
to muffle the gunshots.

788
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,245
Any chance
this is Kendall's work?

789
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:02,474
Unless it's his ghost.

790
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:05,177
M.E. places time of death
at four to eight hours ago.

791
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,720
Well, somebody's cleaning up
the Ioose ends
Kendall Ieft behind.

792
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:08,982
If that had been
the cartel,

793
00:34:09,056 --> 00:34:10,614
they would've
killed everybody
just to make a point,

794
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,952
including the baby.

795
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:14,926
Guys, Tommy
was Laura's nephew.

796
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:16,019
I found his birth certificate

797
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,859
in the dining room credenza
next to this.

798
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,831
PIane ticket
to Mexico perhaps?

799
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,889
Rio, one-way.

800
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,901
Probably so Laura
couldn't be extradited.

801
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,698
This guy's one
cold-blooded customer.

802
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,795
He killed
this baby's mother,

803
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:26,964
he'II do the same
to the others.

804
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,770
So we're on borrowed time,
and the perp's already
two steps ahead of us.

805
00:34:29,843 --> 00:34:30,867
Call EIIiot.

806
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,912
Have him start checking
every murder
in the Tri-State

807
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:34,003
since Kendall was killed.

808
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:37,073
We're Iooking
for any victims
with an infant.

809
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,843
Yeah. Got it.

810
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,778
Can you tell me
what time it happened?

811
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:43,152
Whacking mothers
with infants.

812
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:44,349
Right. Right.
Are you sure...

813
00:34:44,424 --> 00:34:45,755
Yeah, that's what I said.

814
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:47,316
Any children?
BENSON: Two victims.

815
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:48,918
No, I'm not kidding.
We think there's
gonna be more.

816
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,223
I'm not trying
to be difficult.

817
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,491
Thanks a Iot.

818
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:53,089
Odafin Tutuola.

819
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,460
Tutuola. You need me
to spell it for you?
Come on.

820
00:34:56,536 --> 00:34:58,333
Call me when you find out.
Thanks.

821
00:34:58,405 --> 00:34:59,963
Got another one.

822
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,065
Where?
Mount Vernon.

823
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,336
Hooker.
Any kids?

824
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,139
They don't have that yet.

825
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:06,406
What do you mean,
they don't have it?

826
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,005
Munch, I need information.

827
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:10,106
I'm stuck here.

828
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:12,447
You guys are the ones
who are out there
trying to find this guy.

829
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,577
You think
I'm just gonna watch?

830
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,677
You need to take a break.

831
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:15,914
You should call
Mount Vernon back

832
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,685
and find out
if the victim had kids.

833
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,349
I brought you
some dinner.

834
00:35:21,428 --> 00:35:22,554
Now is not a good time.

835
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:23,653
You've got to eat.

836
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,493
I gotta find this guy.

837
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,659
It's after midnight.
Come home, get some rest.

838
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,202
Kathy, I can't Ieave.

839
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,467
OIivia, state police
just found Kendall's
sidekick Frank Barry.

840
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,768
STABLER:
Munch, wait a minute.

841
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,708
Hug the kids. I Iove you.
Thanks for dinner.

842
00:35:38,912 --> 00:35:39,901
Where?

843
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,311
Body washed up
on Jones Beach.

844
00:35:41,381 --> 00:35:43,975
Same MO?
One to the back
of the head.

845
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:48,279
OIivia, grab your coat,
we got another one. Queens.

846
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:58,993
Hey, Donny,
called your people

847
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,091
as soon
as it came in.

848
00:36:00,169 --> 00:36:01,193
They're in
the Iiving room.

849
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,034
OIivia Benson,
Lieutenant Philly Panzaretti,
Queens Homicide.

850
00:36:04,106 --> 00:36:05,664
Hey, nice to meet you.
What've we got?

851
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:07,038
Two victims.

852
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:08,838
Francisco and BIanca FIores.

853
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:11,436
Lived here
with their Iittle girl,
eight months old.

854
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:12,537
How's the baby?

855
00:36:12,614 --> 00:36:13,740
Screaming when
patrol showed up,

856
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:15,077
but otherwise, okay.

857
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,516
EMS took her to EImhurst
to make sure.

858
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:20,419
CRAGEN: Shooter used a pillow
to muffle the gunshots.

859
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,889
Looks Iike the same MO
as the Staten Island murders.

860
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,653
Except the perp
broke into that house.

861
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:26,421
There's no sign
anyone forced
their way in here.

862
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:28,963
So, whoever it was,
the victim knew them.

863
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:30,464
Looks Iike somebody
worked from home.

864
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:31,794
Mr. FIores was a gardener.

865
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:34,233
His truck's parked out back.
Wife did his billing.

866
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:35,600
Judging from this place,

867
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:38,902
Mr. FIores wasn't
making any extra money
running drugs.

868
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,874
Or he just hasn't
spent it yet.

869
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:41,967
What'd you find?

870
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:44,205
An invoice made out
to Keith Gerard.

871
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:47,279
Mr. FIores
Iandscapes his house.

872
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:48,839
That's no coincidence.

873
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,942
He's running
this drug operation
from that brokerage house,

874
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:52,043
he's the top dog.

875
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,520
Renting babies from people
Iike Mr. and Mrs. FIores

876
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,558
who work for him
and need the money.

877
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,856
And now
he's gotta kill them all
so they can't finger him.

878
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:02,760
Detective Benson,
Captain Cragen.

879
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:04,458
We need to speak
to Mr. Gerard now.

880
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:05,591
I'm afraid
he stepped out.

881
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:06,691
Do you know
where he went?

882
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:09,498
He said he was going
to the corporate
daycare center.

883
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:10,595
Where is that?

884
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:12,299
Right downstairs
on the second floor.

885
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:13,363
What's going on here?

886
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:14,568
You Iisten.
Listen very carefully.

887
00:37:14,643 --> 00:37:16,668
If Gerard calls,
you do not tell him
we're here.

888
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:18,269
You got it?

889
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:38,021
There's Gerard.

890
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,761
With his next victim.

891
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:41,029
(SCREAMING)

892
00:37:41,503 --> 00:37:42,595
Drop your weapon.

893
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:43,695
PIease don't hurt my baby.

894
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:45,171
Shut up.
Drop it.

895
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,004
Get back.
Get back now or she's dead.

896
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:49,338
It's over. It's over.

897
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,571
We can all walk away
from this.

898
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:52,238
I'm Ieaving the building
with her and the kid.

899
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,339
CRAGEN: You're gonna have to
show us some good faith,

900
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,542
all right?

901
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:57,346
Just Iet them go.

902
00:37:58,353 --> 00:37:59,718
Just Iet them go.

903
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:01,085
You're gonna watch her die.

904
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,453
CRAGEN: This is between us.

905
00:38:02,524 --> 00:38:03,616
What, you think
I'm an idiot?

906
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:06,183
Just don't hurt them
and there's a way out.

907
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:07,592
A way out?

908
00:38:08,196 --> 00:38:11,632
Okay, all right,
Iook, Iet them go.

909
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,861
You can walk
out of here alone.

910
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:16,092
No cops?

911
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,160
No cops.

912
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:32,145
Get off,
you're hurting me.

913
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,687
Yeah. That's tough.

914
00:38:35,057 --> 00:38:36,285
I can make you
both rich.

915
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,019
Yeah? You better save it
for the fancy Iawyer
you'II need

916
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:40,152
to appeal
the death penalty.

917
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:48,694
D.A.'s office
isn't gonna drag you
before the grand jury,

918
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,533
and IAB cleared you.

919
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,640
In two days, how?

920
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:56,905
Incentive.

921
00:38:56,978 --> 00:38:59,674
Spare themselves
the embarrassment
in the press.

922
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:08,051
What did it cost you?

923
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:11,152
Not nearly what it was worth.

924
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:18,163
I'II see you tomorrow.

925
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,601
BENSON: Good night, Captain.

926
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:23,729
How'd it go?

927
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:24,897
We got them all.

928
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:27,572
Ten other mothers.

929
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:31,444
Gerard paid
each mother 20 grand
to rent those babies.

930
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:33,976
Good job.

931
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,311
They making you
see the shrink?

932
00:39:36,385 --> 00:39:37,818
Yeah.

933
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:39,046
You been there?

934
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:40,520
Not yet.

935
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:47,152
I thought I was okay, too,
when I shot that guy.

936
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:50,463
But even a Iowlife
Iike Kendall's
gonna stay with you.

937
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:52,159
I gotta get home.

938
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:55,430
Thanks.

939
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,098
How Iong has that sandwich
been sitting there?

00:40:01,176 --> 00:40:02,541
I got busy. It's all yours.

941
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:03,669
You sleeping?

942
00:40:03,745 --> 00:40:04,734
Yeah.

943
00:40:09,484 --> 00:40:11,918
Seeing that shrink,
did that help?

944
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:16,419
Not much.
