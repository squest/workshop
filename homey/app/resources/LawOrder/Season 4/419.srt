00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:00,198
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:05,898
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,167
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:10,142
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:13,703
are members of
an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:15,408
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:19,617
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

8
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,984
Everyone stay
with your partners
and sit in front.

9
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,329
Mrs. MacNamara,
Caleb's not sitting
in the front.

10
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,092
Yes, Stacey,
I can see.

11
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,599
We need to be Iet off
at the Natural
History Museum.

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,100
I stop at
81st Street.

13
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,933
CALEB: Mrs. MacNamara,
someone's Ieft
their suitcase.

14
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,607
It's pretty heavy.

15
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:46,204
Don't touch it, Caleb.
I want everyone off
this bus right now.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,975
GIRL 1: Why?
GIRL 2: Why?

17
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,376
We cleared 250 feet
in every direction.
It's all yours.

18
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,251
Okay.

19
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,584
Gonna take Iong
to set up the X-ray?

20
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,090
No, they're good to go.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,435
ESU SERGEANT: Could be
nothing. Maybe somebody
just forgot their suitcase.

22
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,631
BOMB SQUAD DETECTIVE:
Till it's properly ID'd,
I'm not taking any chances.

23
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,367
X-ray should tell
us clear enough.

24
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,370
Image is coming up.

25
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:25,675
Oh, man, it's not a bomb.

26
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,421
Female victim,
eight or nine, no ID.

27
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,789
Jammed inside a suitcase
which was Ieft on the bus.

28
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,225
Driver remember
who brought it on?

29
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,853
Nope. This was
his third run.

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,831
Could be anyone
from Union Square
to 147th Street.

31
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,423
Basically all
of Manhattan.

32
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,059
Cause of death?

33
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,660
I don't
know yet.

34
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,002
How Iong she been
in the suitcase?

35
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,301
WARNER: Hard to say.

36
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,740
She has Iigature marks
on her ankles and wrists.

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,278
That and the Iividity,
she had to be held
somewhere else first,

38
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,213
tied in the cuffing position,
hands behind her back.

39
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,945
She's got French nails.
Nice manicure.

40
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,078
Pedicure, too.
Salon job.

41
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:04,124
Looks Iike she got
the full treatment.

42
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,818
She's got dark roots.

43
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,451
She's not a natural blonde.

44
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,088
Isn't she a bit young
to be made up
Iike a fashion model?

45
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,655
BENSON: Not if she's on
the kiddy pageant circuit.

46
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,460
As in JonBenet?

47
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,733
Yep. We got ourselves
a dead beauty queen.

48
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,923
Rape kit was
positive for fluids,
I'm running the DNA.

49
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,015
We know
how she died?

50
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,184
Afraid so.

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,923
I found vomit
and fragments of
Iatex in her mouth.

52
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,090
So he ties her up,
he rapes her.

53
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,566
She's terrified, throws up,
can't remove the gag.

54
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,603
And our perp just
watches her die.

55
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,731
I also found a piece
of saw grass on
the inside of her sweater.

56
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,139
Saw grass?
Does that grow
around here?

57
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,336
No.

58
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,869
It grows almost exclusively
in the FIorida Everglades.

59
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,075
So, maybe he
kidnapped her down there,
brought her up here.

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,084
Anything to support
the beauty pageant theory?

61
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,551
You bet.

62
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,613
Obliquely oriented
cicatricial contracture along
the internal nasal vault.

63
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,715
What the hell is that?

64
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,123
A damn good nose job.

65
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,725
Suitcase model
was discontinued
10 years ago,

66
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,231
but it used to be
available nationwide.

67
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,462
Couple of partial prints,
but not enough to
make a positive ID.

68
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,504
Nobody saw the guy
Ieave it on the bus?

69
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,630
Patrol's passing out flyers
along the bus route.

70
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:02,471
Nothing yet,
except some old Iady
said she saw Osama bin Laden.

71
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:03,737
And the victim?

72
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:07,406
No missing kid reports
in FIorida or the tri-state
area in the Iast 24 hours.

73
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,743
Any hits on
beauty contests?

74
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,078
I faxed the victim's photo

75
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,079
to the Little
Miss Angel Pageant
in Westchester.

76
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,179
They checked it against
finalists for the Iast
two years, no matches.

77
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,192
Well, to make
the nationals, you must
have to compete Iocally.

78
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,784
Any recent contests
in the area?

79
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,123
BENSON: Actually,
in the Iast two months,

80
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,754
one in Queens,
one in Greenwich,

81
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,856
and one coming
up in Garden City.

82
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,594
I wonder how many
of these
Little Miss Angels

83
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,898
get nose jobs
when they're nine.

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,337
OIivia, you and EIIiot
talk to the nip and tuck
brigade.

85
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,638
John, what do you say,
you and me check out
the kiddie pageant scene?

86
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,405
(MUSIC PLAYING)

87
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,039
SYLVIA: Girls,
practice your entrances.

88
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,983
Six steps, stop,
smile and twirl.

89
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,610
Step, stop,
smile and twirl.

90
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,746
CRAGEN: New York City Police.
We need a word.

91
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,791
Parents actually pay you
to inflict this
on their kids?

92
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,419
Yes. The young Iadies
find it very
character forming.

93
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,521
I have taught
Iiterally hundreds
of aspiring Little Angels.

94
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,929
You teach this one?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,059
Oh, my God!
What happened?

96
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,832
Her body was found
this morning. We think
she might be a contestant.

97
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,208
Not in any
recent competitions.

98
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,835
But I do keep files
of all the hopefuls
who don't make the cut.

99
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,071
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

100
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,306
They're arranged
alphabetically.

101
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,870
What? Yeah.

102
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,041
So, can anybody get in
to see the pageants?

103
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,848
Oh, no, we are very
strict about checking
people's door badges.

104
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,218
How hard is it
to get a badge?

105
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,688
$25.

106
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,719
That was OIivia.

107
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,785
Nassau cops put out
a missing kid alert
about an hour ago.

108
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,888
Girl's name is Cherie Lathan,
Iives in Valley Stream.

109
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,128
OIivia and EIIiot
are on their way
to talk to the parents.

110
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,500
Bingo, I got a match
on the victim.

111
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,338
Mr. Lathan,
how Iong has Cherie
been competing?

112
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,504
About four years.

113
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,481
After one of her friends
entered the Little Miss Angel
Pageant,

114
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,542
Cherie wanted
to do it, too.

115
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,450
And when was
her Iast pageant?

116
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,389
Three months ago,
right before she
had an operation.

117
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,983
PIastic surgery.

118
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,690
You're never gonna
have that edge,
if you don't go for it.

119
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:04,992
It's what
Cherie wanted.

120
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,589
It's what
you wanted.

121
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,000
Why did it take you
so Iong to report
your daughter missing?

122
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,437
Last night she slept over
at her friend
Amy Prescott's house,

123
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,635
and this morning
she was supposed
to go right to school.

124
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,976
That's where
I thought she was.

125
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,139
When was the Iast
time you saw Cherie?

126
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:25,174
Yesterday afternoon,
when he took her to
get new headshots.

127
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,016
And then I dropped
her off at Amy's.

128
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,182
We'II need Amy's address.
Have you been to
FIorida recently?

129
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,955
(SOBBING) We took Cherie
to Disney World
at Christmas.

130
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,090
We're going to
need a DNA sample,
Mr. Lathan.

131
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:43,227
It's standard procedure.

132
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:47,399
I know what you're thinking,
but I'd never hurt Cherie.

133
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,704
I worshipped her.

134
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,251
Did Cherie spend the night
here Iast night,
Mrs. Prescott?

135
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,649
Yes.

136
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,688
And did she go to school
this morning with Amy?

137
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,691
Amy came down
with the flu, so
Cherie went on her own.

138
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,497
I offered to give her
a ride to the bus stop,
but she said she'd walk.

139
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,965
How far away
is the bus stop?

140
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,264
Four blocks.

141
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,804
I should have insisted
on driving her,

142
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,363
but I didn't want
to Ieave Amy.

143
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,373
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,012
Amy, did Cherie
ever mention anyone
bothering her?

145
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,040
Kind of.

146
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,551
STABLER: Yeah?
Who's that?

147
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,452
There's this creepy
guy in tenth grade.

148
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,080
What's his name?

149
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,648
Kevin. I don't know
his Iast name.

150
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,127
What sorts of things
did Kevin do?

151
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,796
He used to come up to us
and tell Cherie that
she Iooked really hot.

152
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,167
You know,
Iike he meant it.

153
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,764
Mmm-hmm.

154
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,205
He ever follow
you guys around?

155
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,400
Sometimes.

156
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:59,105
And he'd hang around
at gymnastics practice
and just stare at us.

157
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,171
MUNCH: Kevin's
an enterprising
young man.

158
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,717
He posts his stories
for the world to read
on his own website.

159
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:05,843
Listen to this.

160
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,015
"9-year-old flesh is Iike
fruit from the tree,
firm but sweet.

161
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,820
"What I would do
to take a bite
out of Cherie."

162
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,053
It's downhill
from there.

163
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,118
School have anything
to say about him?

164
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,529
Guidance counselor said he
recently persuaded a sixth
grader to pose in a bikini.

165
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,658
He said it was
for an art project.

166
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,794
This creep is 15.
You tell me that's
not predatory behavior.

167
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,168
Well, he Iooks
good for it.

168
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,333
Especially since
the DNA on Cherie's
father came back clean.

169
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,308
He still turned
his daughter into
a sex object.

170
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,743
Made her ripe for
Kevin's picking.

171
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,748
CRAGEN: That must be
Kevin and his dad.
Talk to them.

172
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,318
Where were you
this morning, Kevin?
School marked you absent.

173
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,515
MR. ROUMEL:
You were ditching?

174
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,955
I was walking around.
It helps me think.

175
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,822
That's not much
of an alibi.

176
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,761
I don't need an alibi.
I would never touch Cherie.

177
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,923
You hurt her pretty bad
in your Iittle stories.

178
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,694
"She tried to escape,
but I was too strong.

179
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,530
"I held her down and
Iicked her tears away."

180
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,867
Look, they're just stories,
all right.
Creative expression.

181
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,601
The minute you censor them,
you're just Iike a Nazi.

182
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,972
Cherie was raped
and murdered.

183
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,908
I don't want to hear
about your damn stories.

184
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,378
Look, I make stuff up,
I don't do it.

185
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,914
Then give us a DNA sample.

186
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,847
No. You can't violate
my civil Iiberties

187
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,852
just because I've
got a good imagination.

188
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,579
He'II give
you a sample.

189
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,179
You can't force me.
MUNCH: Sure he can.

190
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,622
Parental consent
is all we need
till you're 16.

191
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,150
This isn't fair.
You fascists Iay one
finger on me, I will sue.

192
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,457
Sit down, you Iittle prick.

193
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,519
(GRUNTS)

194
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,899
Will this do?

195
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,804
Sorry, no match.
It's not Kevin.

196
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,238
Maybe not this time,
just give him
a couple of years.

197
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:35,570
So, we've got nothing.

198
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:36,700
Not exactly.

199
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:40,110
BIood traces in the perp's
ejaculate gave us something
interesting.

200
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,239
High Ievels
of progesterone.

201
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,908
Well, that's a female hormone.

202
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,680
Most often given
to high school girls
to prevent pregnancy.

203
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,653
So, why's our
perp taking that?

204
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,690
To block
testosterone
production.

205
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,817
He could be using it
to treat advanced
prostatic cancer,

206
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,556
or he's undergoing
male-to-female
gender reassignment.

207
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,894
And it's given
to sex offenders
to reduce sex drive.

208
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,196
But synthetic
testosterone isn't.

209
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,236
I also found traces
of that in the blood.

210
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,637
Our guy's trying to
reverse the effects of
chemical castration.

211
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,538
He raped a girl,
I'd say he succeeded.

212
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,600
And I bet that freak
won't stop at one.

213
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,950
New York doesn't
chemically castrate
sex offenders.

214
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,815
We got nine states that do,
Georgia being the closest one
to us.

215
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,513
What about voluntary
castration?

216
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,352
Technically you can
self-inject, but we're
doubting our guy did.

217
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,052
I mean, otherwise
what's he doing
taking testosterone?

218
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,389
He's done
his homework.

219
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,555
The effects of Depo-Provera
can be blocked within a week

220
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,258
by using testosterone
supplements.

221
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,960
So this guy
traded in his breasts
for a sex drive.

222
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:36,730
Does that fit
the crime scene profile?

223
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,464
Absolutely.

224
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,972
Beauty pageants
offer the killer
the perfect victim.

225
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,670
Sexualized children
who are both
innocent and provocative.

226
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,178
EIaborate bondage shows
that he fantasized
about this for a Iong time

227
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,113
before he dared
even act on it.

228
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,378
Get a Iist of castratees
from the nine states.

229
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:56,388
Check probation violations,
relocations and
child-abduction priors.

230
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,650
Prison bureau in Georgia,
they send you
to the parole board

231
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,160
which sends you to
the state attorney,

232
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,560
who sends you back
to the parole board.

233
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,861
Yeah, I got the same
run around in Oregon,
Texas and Louisiana.

234
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,867
Chemical castration
hasn't been Iegal
Iong enough

235
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,266
for there to be
a centralized database.

236
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,602
Look, there's got
to be a way for us
to narrow this down.

237
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,337
AII right,
FIorida is one
of our states.

238
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,709
We've been thinking that

239
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,748
Cherie got that
saw grass on her

240
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,407
when she took
that trip to Orlando.

241
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,941
But the ME says that
saw grass grows exclusively
in the Everglades.

242
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,112
That's south of there.

243
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:33,125
Our perp undresses Cherie,
he transfers the saw grass
from his clothes to hers?

244
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,390
Okay, maybe. Now, what do we
know about these three upright
citizens in FIorida?

245
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,760
Well, one died in a car crash,

246
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,425
and the parole
officers for the other two
say they're squeaky clean.

247
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,832
Squeaky-clean sex offender,
yeah, that's a new one.

248
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:48,136
Rob Canotti from Milwaukee
started chemical castration
treatments four years ago.

249
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,075
Had a supervised
relocation to Jersey City.

250
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,874
Well, maybe, he made an
unsupervised trip to FIorida.

251
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,244
What was Canotti
charged with?

252
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,044
He kidnapped a girl
from a beauty pageant.

253
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,176
He tried to assault
her in his car.

254
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,447
The girl escaped.
She was 10.

255
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,120
BENSON: Rob Canotti?

256
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,591
New York Police
in Jersey City.

257
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,726
Has a child
been attacked?

258
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,463
Why would you ask
us that question?

259
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,562
Why else are
you here?

260
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,971
To talk about
kiddie beauty pageants.

261
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,101
We hear they
turn you on.

262
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,645
If I denied it,
you'd call me a Iiar.

263
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:30,205
You ever see a Iittle girl
named Cherie Lathan compete?

264
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:34,777
Not that I recall,
but it's hard to keep track
of so many Iittle Iovelies.

265
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,254
Where were you
Iast night?

266
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,588
At home watching
Nickelodeon.

267
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,127
Can anyone
vouch for that?

268
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,492
I Iive alone.

269
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,292
Well, then, I think
you better come with us.

270
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,389
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
There's no point.

271
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,490
INTO PHONE: Benson.

272
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:51,137
The guy you're Iooking for
probably ejaculated
in his victim.

273
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,432
What are you saying?

274
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,732
(SIGHS)

275
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,606
The urges started
to come back.

276
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,011
So I had them
cut off.

277
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,206
What?

278
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,949
My gonads, Detective.
Take a Iook.

279
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,181
AII right, all right.
Put your johnson
back in your pants, Canotti.

280
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,154
That was Fin.

281
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,318
Turns out one of our
squeaky-clean FIorida boys

282
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,419
has a mother
who Iives two towns
over from Cherie Lathan.

283
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,690
What's his name?
Tommy Hedges.

284
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,288
Munch and Fin are on
their way over now.

285
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,103
This was Tommy's room,
but I've kept it the same
since he was a boy.

286
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,867
He ever visit from FIorida,
Mrs. Hedges?

287
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,400
No, of course not.
He can't Ieave the state
while he's on probation.

288
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,539
But he knows that his
room is here for him
when he's done his time.

289
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,173
That's your van
in the driveway?

290
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,774
It was my
Iate husband's.

291
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,342
FIN: Lady Iike you,
Iiving all alone,

292
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,047
what do you need
a big van for?

293
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,384
I'm keeping it
for Tommy.

294
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,889
Mind if we take
a Iook inside?

295
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,127
I haven't driven
it in over a year.

296
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,095
I don't even know
where the keys are.

297
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,392
Tommy ever talk to you
about his problems?

298
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,365
They're in the past.

299
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,631
I mean, he feels terrible
about what he did,
but he's changed.

300
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,069
FIN: How?

301
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,974
He's on medication,
and he's found
a job in FIorida.

302
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,712
He's determined to
start a new Iife.

303
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,079
That's awfully clean
for a van that hasn't
been driven in a year.

304
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,981
I say we haul Mom
in for questioning.

305
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,987
I don't Iike sweating
old Iadies. It offends
my sense of decorum.

306
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,886
Oh, you'd rather be
Iooking through garbage?

307
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,289
Cop's gotta do
what he's gotta do.

308
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:24,058
"Mundialfarmacia.com,
laboratorios de Mexico. "

309
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,729
Liquid testosterone.

310
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,529
Hey, get away
from there!

311
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,503
That's private property.
You can't just go on
Iooking through that.

312
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,564
It's on the street,
we can Iook all we want.

313
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,610
Tommy's been
coming home,
hasn't he?

314
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,941
I don't know what
you're talking about.

315
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,981
Well, that's his name
and Iast week's date.

316
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,079
We need to see him.

317
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,814
Look, you have to understand,
Tommy really is better.

318
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:51,483
He found a job
at an advertising
agency in New York.

319
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,185
He works Monday
through Thursday's,

320
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,956
and then he
flies down to Miami
to get his injection.

321
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,155
He's cured.

322
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,366
Tommy Hedges? Police.
We need you to come with us.

323
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,463
What for?
Parole violation.

324
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,974
Oh, Iook, I can explain that.
My parole officer knows
I'm here.

325
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,204
No, he doesn't.
Let's go.

326
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,106
Sure, no problem.

327
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,242
You don't mind
if we take this?

328
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,716
I Iooked for
a job in FIorida,

329
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,417
but no one would
give me a chance
because of my record.

330
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,982
So I came back home.

331
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,190
The Iast thing I wanted
to do was fly up each week,
but I was desperate.

332
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,357
BENSON: That's a sad story,
Tommy.

333
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,262
I'm not asking
for pity,

334
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,998
but everyone thinks
sex offender registration
is this great idea.

335
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,768
It's not. It's hell,

336
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,968
especially for those of us
who are trying to make
a new start.

337
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:54,477
Look,
I know I've broken parole,
but I'm taking my shots.

338
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,889
What does your parole officer
think you're doing?

339
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,650
Telemarketing from home.

340
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,255
He never does
a curfew check.

341
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:06,926
I fly back to Miami
every Friday,
and meet him and get my shot.

342
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,572
So what are you doing
with testosterone, huh?

343
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,106
That for jet Iag?

344
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,608
I want to Iive
a normal Iife.

345
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,148
Be in a normal
relationship.

346
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:25,777
What woman wants a guy
who can't perform?

347
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,650
Does Cherie Lathan
count as a woman?

348
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,915
I don't know
who she is.

349
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,489
It's the 9-year-old
you raped and killed.

350
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,328
No. This is a mistake.

351
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,425
STABLER: Well, okay.

352
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,163
Well, Tommy,
if that's the truth,

353
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:45,728
then we're gonna
be the first ones
to apologize to you.

354
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,104
We got plenty of ways
to check it out.

355
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,541
Which flight you
took from FIorida,
Friday night,

356
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,636
after you met with
your parole officer.

357
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:56,240
Whether there's any trace
evidence of Cherie Lathan
in your daddy's old van.

358
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:59,844
Whether your DNA
matches the fluids
found in the girl.

359
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,121
Some of that'II
take time,

360
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,283
but since you're
going back to prison

361
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,793
for parole violation
for at Ieast 10 years,

362
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:10,387
I guess you're
not in any hurry.

363
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,624
STABLER: Tommy.

364
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:15,592
What happened?

365
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:20,298
Just tell us.
You'II feel better,
I promise you.

366
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,140
What's the matter?

367
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,347
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

368
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:39,724
I'd noticed her before,
with the other girls,
just walking around.

369
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,388
She stood out Iike
a Iittle princess.

370
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,592
I offered her a ride.

371
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:49,898
I just wanted
to talk to her.

372
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,500
She was so
sweet and Iovely.

373
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,669
Where did you
do it, Tommy?

374
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,445
In the van.

375
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:05,144
She was crying afterwards.

376
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:08,484
She was saying she would tell,
and I had to keep her quiet.

377
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,148
And she wouldn't stop crying.

378
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:11,782
I had to stop her.

379
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,019
So you gagged her.

380
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,425
Yeah.

381
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,588
And then I Ieft
to get some air,

382
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,689
and when I came back,
she wasn't moving.

383
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:23,094
I didn't mean
to hurt her.

384
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,937
Tommy, have you hurt
any others, other than Cherie?

385
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:32,501
TOMMY: No.

386
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,913
I thought I could
control my feelings
until I read that story.

387
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,484
What story?

388
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:43,523
On the Internet. This...

389
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:48,721
It had pictures and
words and everything.

390
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,659
It stuck in my head.

391
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,527
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

392
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,294
Lab's got something
you should see.

393
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:00,669
In all, he's got about
40 kiddie porn shots on there.

394
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:04,074
His parole officer probably
missed, they were hidden
by the S-Tools software.

395
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:05,373
S-Tools?
Yeah.

396
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:06,879
"S" is short
for steganography.

397
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:08,005
Oh.

398
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,312
From the Greek,
meaning "hidden writing."

399
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:13,217
Mainly used by spies
to send concealed messages.

400
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:17,155
So Hedges downloads the child
porn and disguises it with
this stegosaurus stuff.

401
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,784
The porn can be hidden
in a photo of a sunset,
anything at all.

402
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,522
Hedges simply uses the S-Tools
to download and decode it.

403
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:23,790
So how'd you find it?

404
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:26,025
I went onto his hard drive
and used his own software.

405
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,898
This is what I thought
you should see.

406
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,369
"The Story of Janet. "

407
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:39,242
MORALES: Basically, it's a how
to on stalking, abducting
and raping Iittle girls,

408
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:41,338
with accompanying photos.

409
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:50,886
Wait a minute, she's tied up
the same way, and in the same
position, as Cherie Lathan.

410
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,553
The bastard downloaded
the photos, and copied
exactly what he saw.

411
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:02,232
Just because porn inspired
Tommy Hedges to murder doesn't
diminish his culpability.

412
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:03,964
Hedges deserves everything
that's coming to him,

413
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:05,699
but whoever produced
these is guilty, too.

414
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:08,537
Of producing
and distributing child
pornography, not murder.

415
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,509
Look, Hedges copied
exactly what he saw.

416
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:13,012
These photos are as dangerous
as putting a Ioaded weapon

417
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,809
in the hands of
a violent criminal.

418
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,873
I'm not saying
child pornography
isn't repugnant,

419
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,782
but you would
have a hard time
convincing a jury

420
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,717
that a murderer
and a pornographer
are equally guilty.

421
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:21,914
Doc, what do you think?

422
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:25,481
A Canadian study found that
90% of child sex abusers
used hardcore pornography.

423
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,618
Well, did it make them
all go out and commit murder?

424
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:29,322
Pornography desensitizes.

425
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,387
Repeated viewing
can condition arousal,

426
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:34,628
so that the viewer seeks out
more violent,
more degrading images.

427
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,567
It can also increase
the tendency to act out

428
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,127
some of the activities
that are portrayed.

429
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,639
So the murderer has
no choice in the matter?
I don't buy it.

430
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,902
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

431
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,570
Hedges already
molested children.

432
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,704
So he was highly susceptible
to these images.

433
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,839
You view it,
you fantasize about it,
you do it.

434
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,110
I agree with EIIiot.

435
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,812
Cherie Lathan might still
be alive if Hedges hadn't
seen these pictures.

436
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,114
I can't
indict pictures.

437
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,156
You can indict the producers
and the distributors.

438
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:57,747
They could be
anywhere in the world.

439
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:01,420
Crime Iab found the website
through Hedges' Iaptop.

440
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:05,022
With the help
of ARIN registry,
we got the address.

441
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,363
Cyberloves Incorporated
in Queens.

442
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,034
Bust them.

443
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:17,305
STABLER: NYPD!
Everyone stay where you are.

444
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:18,743
MAN: Officers,
what can I do for you?

445
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:20,109
Get out of my way.

446
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,613
MAN: Excuse me,
this is private property.

447
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:22,944
BENSON: Yeah,
and there's your warrant.

448
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:25,008
STABLER: You all right?
What's your problem?

449
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,814
What's my problem?
How old are you?

450
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:28,286
Nineteen.

451
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,084
STABLER: Let me see some ID.

452
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,125
What's my problem?

453
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:37,890
You always carry around
a birth certificate with you?

454
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:41,366
Yeah, 'cause I'm
sick of getting harassed
by cops when I'm modeling.

455
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:45,132
Modeling, right.
It says she's 19.
Let's check that out.

456
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:48,174
This picture was found
on your company's website.

457
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:49,368
You know who she is?

458
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,171
No.

459
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:52,972
She Iook 19 to you?

460
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:54,173
No idea.

461
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,307
BENSON: Who do you work for?
Cyberloves.

462
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,214
I'm not breaking any Iaw.

463
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:01,550
Sweetheart, a 9-year-old girl
was murdered, just Iike
the girl in this photo,

464
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,749
and it was posted
on Cyberloves' website

465
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,349
by the dirt bag
that you're working for.

466
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:08,395
Who runs this operation?

467
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,655
BENSON: Who signs
your paycheck?

468
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:17,967
Excel Entertainment.
Stanley Billings.

469
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:23,105
No girl working for
Excel Entertainment
is underage.

470
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:26,635
That's the company policy,
and it is strictly enforced.

471
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:28,614
Now, Mr. Billings,
does your website,

472
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,547
cyberloves.net,
sell The Story of Janet?

473
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:31,811
Yes.

474
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:33,978
And on a Tanner scale,
she scores pretty Iow.

475
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:36,113
Tanner scale?
I don't know
what that is.

476
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,589
It's a body
development chart.

477
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,626
One being prepubescent,
5 being adult.

478
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,524
Now, Janet is a two.

479
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,694
Some girls
develop slowly.

480
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:47,222
Don't hand me that crap.
My 10-year-old daughter
Iooks more mature than that.

481
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:50,930
I told you,
we have a company rule,
no underage models.

482
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,097
Why would I risk
my business?

483
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:55,141
Happy pedophiles
spend more money.

484
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,033
(SIGHS)

485
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:58,942
You ever heard of
virtual pornography?

486
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:03,915
That girl is 18. Legal age.
We only help her
Iook younger.

487
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:05,246
And how's that?

488
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:07,886
With youth
enhancement software.

489
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:10,082
The people that
get off on this
don't think she's 18.

490
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:14,617
But she is,
and Iooking at that
is not a crime.

491
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:18,631
Thousands of men and women
enjoy the services of
Excel Entertainment.

492
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:22,260
Virtual pornography is
actually therapeutic,

493
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,328
it provides for men
a cathartic release,

494
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:28,307
and it still
protects the real kids.

495
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,138
Not all of them.

496
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,303
Somebody went out
and copied your images,

497
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:34,939
and a real 9-year-old
child wound up dead.

498
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:42,045
Then I'm truly sorry,
but I still haven't
broken the Iaw.

499
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:44,522
The Story of Janet
is a murder manual.

500
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,424
Your pornography is
responsible for the death
of an innocent child.

501
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:50,827
Read the Supreme Court ruling.
"The mere tendency of speech,

502
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:55,631
"to encourage unlawful acts
is not a sufficient reason
for banning it."

503
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:01,035
The scary thing is,
the girl in the picture
probably is 18.

504
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,303
You're telling me
photo touch-ups
can make her Iook 10?

505
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:05,311
Yeah, Billings takes
the digital software

506
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:08,371
used to age up
the missing photos of
kids on milk cartons,

507
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:11,612
but uses it in reverse
to age them down.

508
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:12,777
Look.

509
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:14,887
I took a photo of you,
OIivia,

510
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:18,118
and broke it down
into its thousands
of digital parts.

511
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:21,821
Once the parts are isolated,
you can morph them
in whatever way you want.

512
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:22,953
Oh, my God.

513
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,295
Yeah, the good news is that
a trained eye can
usually tell when it's fake.

514
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:27,856
STABLER: What's the bad news?

515
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,562
In the field of
image manipulation,

516
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,501
the porn industry
Ieads the way.

517
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:36,598
Are you telling me
these sick bastards

518
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:39,510
can make virtual kiddie porn
and not break the Iaw?

519
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,207
I'm afraid so.

520
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:43,476
Excel Entertainment
is skirting the Ietter
of the Iaw

521
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,882
by exploiting
the fantasies
of pedophiles.

522
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,820
It's reprehensible,
and it's perfectly Iegal.

523
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:52,950
Can't Excel be required
to safeguard their website
from vulnerable viewers?

524
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:55,586
They already do.
You have to be 18
or older to Iog on.

525
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,890
STABLER: What about
The Story of Janet?

526
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:57,864
They're sending
out sadistic pictures

527
00:24:57,932 --> 00:25:01,561
along with instructions
on how to abduct
and rape Iittle girls.

528
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:04,332
Then they top it off
by telling you how to
avoid getting caught.

529
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,339
There must be
something we can
do about that.

530
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:09,774
No. Billings will
wrap himself up
in the First Amendment,

531
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,243
and cry freedom of speech.

532
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:14,372
This is so wrong.
Look, you're...

533
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:18,514
AII you're saying
is the constitution
allows someone

534
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:22,647
to publish a blueprint
for child rape as Iong
as he calls it art.

535
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,051
Wait a minute.

536
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:29,893
If we can prove that
Billings provided
assistance to Tommy Hedges

537
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:33,092
in the rape and murder
of Cherie Lathan,
then it's facilitation.

538
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:35,335
So, how do
we prove that?

539
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,032
I have to make
a deal with the Devil.

540
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:45,435
You give me Billings
and I'II take the death
penalty off the table.

541
00:25:45,513 --> 00:25:47,105
Not good enough.

542
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:53,378
He sees Iight at the end
of the tunnel or
he doesn't talk.

543
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:58,617
Fine, murder two,
depending on what
Tommy has to offer.

544
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:05,227
When would I get out?

545
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,132
CABOT: Twenty-five years.

546
00:26:12,674 --> 00:26:14,005
AII right.

547
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,009
When did you start
receiving e-mails
from Excel?

548
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,641
In January,
right after I
got out of jail.

549
00:26:23,718 --> 00:26:27,154
They just sent ads
for websites at first.

550
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,382
Usually they
included samples.

551
00:26:31,793 --> 00:26:33,852
Were you tempted?
Yes.

552
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:37,728
But I didn't give in,
not till they sent a preview
of The Story of Janet.

553
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:43,234
It was just a few Iines
and a photo of this girl
dressed Iike a princess.

554
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:48,675
It was just so...exciting.

555
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:52,635
So you signed up
for the website?

556
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:54,679
Yeah.

557
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:57,945
And I read the whole story,
and I saw the pictures.

558
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:00,783
And I wanted my body
to feel the way it used to.

559
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:04,382
But because of chemical
castration, you couldn't
become aroused, right?

560
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:07,820
Yeah.

561
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:12,929
So the next day
I ordered the testosterone.

562
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:20,941
You can't just come
barging in here.

563
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,237
Sure we can.
We're arresting you.

564
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,608
For what?
Facilitating the murder
of Cherie Lathan.

565
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,737
You're joking.

566
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:27,747
Does it Iook Iike
I'm Iaughing.
Why don't you turn around?

567
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:29,077
You have the right
to remain silent.

568
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,880
Anything you say, can and
will be used against you
in a court of Iaw.

569
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:33,147
You have the right...

570
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:37,083
CABOT: I'm telling you.
This is a tough case.
I could easily Iose.

571
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:39,524
Stanley Billings
is the reason
this happened.

572
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:42,256
Maybe. But the facilitation
charge against him is a reach.

573
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,957
And no matter what we do,
the defense is going to say

574
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,932
we're trying to
stifle free speech.

575
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,468
Free speech? Okay.

576
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:53,405
Free speech,
Cherie Lathan's Iife.
I don't see the contest.

577
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:54,566
MOREDOCK: AIex.

578
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:56,439
Barry. Hi.

579
00:27:57,445 --> 00:28:00,209
EIIiot, I'd Iike for you
to meet my old Iaw professor,
Barry Moredock.

580
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,748
How are you?
Barry, this is
Detective EIIiot Stabler.

581
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:03,374
Detective.
What are you
doing here?

582
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:04,748
We're doing
business together.

583
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:05,945
What do you mean?

584
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,317
Stanley Billings.

585
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:09,917
Don't tell me
you're representing him.

586
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:13,358
I see the First
Amendment under attack,
I Ieap to its defense.

587
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:16,192
But I was kind of surprised
to see you're the attacker.

588
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:18,994
Your client's kiddie porn
is the reason a 9-year-old
girl was murdered.

589
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:22,628
A convicted sex offender
killed that poor girl,
Detective.

590
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:26,037
My client merely exercised
his right to free speech.

591
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:29,338
US v. Barnett.
Publishing instructions
designed to aid another

592
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,672
in the commission
of a criminal offense

593
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:32,736
is not protected
by the First Amendment.

594
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:35,908
Very good, but all
my client published

595
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:39,680
was a work of virtual
pornography protected
by the Supreme Court itself.

596
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:43,246
Billings is a sleaze bag
who turns women
into Iittle girls.

597
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:44,723
He makes a mockery
of the Iaw.

598
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,386
Jurisprudence has to evolve
with the technology.

599
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:49,487
This is gonna be
a great fight, AIex.

600
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:51,532
I'm glad I taught
you so well.

601
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,467
You also taught me
res ipsa Ioquitur.
"The thing speaks for itself."

602
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:58,903
If it Iooks Iike kiddie porn
and smells Iike kiddie porn,
it is kiddie porn.

603
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:01,806
Maybe it's you
who should evolve
with technology, AIex.

604
00:29:01,876 --> 00:29:04,106
There was no kid
in the kiddie porn.

605
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:11,646
The victim died
by asphyxiating
on her own vomit.

606
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,584
CABOT: How did that happen?

607
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:18,023
She couldn't remove her gag
because her hands
were tied behind her.

608
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:20,686
The People's exhibit 12.

609
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:25,631
Dr. Warner, is this how
the victim was tied up
at the moment of her death?

610
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,894
Yes.

611
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:29,493
And are these restraints
the same as
the bondage methods

612
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,061
depicted in
Excel Entertainment's
The Story of Janet,

613
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,802
which Tommy Hedges
downloaded onto his computer?

614
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,036
WARNER: They're identical.

615
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,376
Body position,
placement of Iigatures,
use of a Iatex ball-gag,

616
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:43,975
even the multifold,
overhand knot
tying the ankles.

617
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,713
So, in your professional
opinion, Dr. Warner,

618
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:49,586
did Tommy Hedges
copy the website photo?

619
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,352
In every detail.

620
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:54,760
No further questions.

621
00:29:56,831 --> 00:30:01,427
Dr. Warner,
remind me
what killed Cherie.

622
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:04,437
She asphyxiated
on her own vomit.

623
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:07,633
So she wasn't choked
by a photograph?

624
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:08,766
No.

625
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:12,802
She wasn't
kidnapped by a story?

626
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,938
No.

627
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:18,475
Or bound and gagged
by a website?

628
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:20,311
No.

629
00:30:21,122 --> 00:30:23,818
Thank you.
No further questions.

630
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:30,821
CABOT: Mr. Hedges,
why did you kill
Cherie Lathan?

631
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:34,800
I never meant to.

632
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,536
Did you mean
to rape her?

633
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,365
Yes.

634
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:42,703
Why?

635
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:47,473
Because I couldn't stop
thinking about being
with a Iittle girl.

636
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:52,578
You are a convicted
sex offender,
and you were sentenced

637
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:55,713
to chemical castration
to control your sexual urges.

638
00:30:56,991 --> 00:30:57,424
Did it work?

639
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,451
Yes, for over two years.

640
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,961
When did those
impulses begin again?

641
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:09,935
After I got out of jail,
I started receiving
e-mails from Cyberloves

642
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:12,565
advertising their
child porn stories.

643
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,336
CABOT: What sort of e-mails?

644
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,604
They'd show a photo
of a young girl,

645
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,172
and they invited me
to find out more about her.

646
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,478
So, you signed up?

647
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:23,540
No.

648
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:27,319
I ignored them,
but the e-mails kept coming.

649
00:31:29,057 --> 00:31:30,922
I tried so hard
not to Iook.

650
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,718
Then why did you?

651
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:40,065
Because they kept saying,
"She's waiting for you.

652
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:43,298
"Give her what
she really wants."

653
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,139
It Iit a fire in my head.

654
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,508
I couldn't think
about anything else.

655
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:56,050
So, you bought the story?

656
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,617
Yes. The Story of Janet.

657
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:05,750
And did you copy that story
when you tied up and raped
Cherie Lathan?

658
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,457
Yes.

659
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,203
It told me
exactly what to do.

660
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,037
CABOT: Nothing further.

661
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,809
Mr. Hedges,
you were convicted
in FIorida in 1999

662
00:32:26,882 --> 00:32:29,817
for the sexual abuse
of a 13-year-old girl.

663
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,413
Is that correct?

664
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:33,579
Yes.

665
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:36,818
Did a story
make you do that?

666
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:41,392
No.

667
00:32:41,463 --> 00:32:43,397
How about when you
abducted and sexually abused

668
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:46,161
a 10-year-old in
California in 1995?

669
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,134
Another story to blame?

670
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:50,470
No.

671
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:54,441
What about the very
first time you were
attracted to young girls?

672
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,374
Was that inspired by porn?

673
00:32:56,445 --> 00:32:57,537
I don't know.

674
00:32:57,612 --> 00:32:59,580
Or have you simply been
attracted to young girls

675
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,639
for as Iong as
you can remember?

676
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:04,309
I don't know.

677
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:07,514
Mr. Hedges, aren't you
desperately trying to blame

678
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:10,149
someone else for
your own depravity?

679
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:16,096
They kept sending me e-mails
when I was trying to control
my feelings.

680
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:18,689
Yes. So you've said.

681
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:21,401
But tell me.

682
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:23,832
Tommy,

683
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:28,639
did you enjoy
kidnapping Cherie?

684
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:33,739
Yes.

685
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:38,210
During that time,

686
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:40,948
did you have second thoughts
about what you were doing?

687
00:33:42,991 --> 00:33:44,618
Yes.

688
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:49,596
MOREDOCK: You knew
it was wrong, but still
you raped and killed her.

689
00:33:53,368 --> 00:33:54,460
Yes.

690
00:33:57,305 --> 00:33:59,068
Whose fault is that?

691
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:03,769
Mine.

692
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,149
Thank you.

693
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:22,659
I have children myself,
so the Iast thing I want

694
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:25,723
is for a child to participate
in the making of pornography.

695
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:29,032
That's why
we began Cyberloves.

696
00:34:29,104 --> 00:34:35,043
To make a non-exploitative,
Iegal product for people
with youth preferences.

697
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,270
You mean pedophiles.

698
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:41,407
A small percentage
of our clientele might
have those predilections.

699
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:45,579
Then what made Tommy Hedges
act on those predilections
after viewing your product?

700
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:49,690
I'm afraid I wouldn't know
what motivates a murderer.

701
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:52,454
Do you make any effort at all

702
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:55,690
to suppress the marketing
of your virtual porn
to sex offenders?

703
00:34:55,764 --> 00:35:01,566
We market our product
to individuals over 21
who enjoy adult entertainment.

704
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:04,036
CABOT: Do you call
child rape entertainment?

705
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:08,236
It isn't against the Iaw
to explore the dark side
of human nature.

706
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:14,545
Mr. Billings, would you agree
the purpose of pornography
is to cause sexual arousal?

707
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,248
Yes.

708
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:20,583
And would you agree
that the purpose of
violent pornography

709
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:22,520
is to eroticize violence?

710
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:25,293
It can have
that effect.

711
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:29,361
So it would seem Iogical
that the purpose of
violent child pornography

712
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:32,958
is to arouse
violent sexual feelings
towards children.

713
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:37,664
I don't know the research
on child pornography
because I don't produce it.

714
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,673
You produce images
of child abuse.

715
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:43,575
I produce virtual pornography
that provides a safe release,

716
00:35:43,645 --> 00:35:47,206
so the user can
satiate his fantasies
without abusing anyone.

717
00:35:47,282 --> 00:35:49,842
The truth of the matter
is you don't care
what your customers do

718
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:52,284
as Iong as they continue
to pay for your porn.

719
00:35:52,354 --> 00:35:53,719
Objection.

720
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:55,951
Nothing further.

721
00:35:55,024 --> 00:35:57,049
The defense rests,
Your Honor.

722
00:35:57,126 --> 00:36:00,391
Counsel approach.
Mr. Billings,
you may sit down.

723
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:08,561
Ms. Cabot is nowhere near
meeting the burden of proof,
Your Honor.

724
00:36:08,638 --> 00:36:12,369
Even if the jury convicts
for emotional reasons,

725
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:15,171
I'II ask the court
to follow the Iaw

726
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:17,212
and render a not
guilty judgment.

727
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,077
I agree with Mr. Moredock.

728
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:21,173
Unless you can prove
the defendant had
prior knowledge

729
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,377
that Mr. Hedges was Iikely
to commit a crime,

730
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:26,512
I'II have to dismiss
this case with prejudice.

731
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:28,489
You've got
until tomorrow.

732
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:29,650
We're in recess.

733
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:30,953
(BANGS GAVEL)

734
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:35,327
Tough day?

735
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:37,591
Yeah.

736
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:41,359
If I don't find
a smoking gun,
I'm screwed.

737
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:43,905
We've been Iooking, AIex,
we can't find what
isn't there.

738
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:45,907
Billings is a businessman.

739
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:48,000
He would do anything
to increase his profits.

740
00:36:48,077 --> 00:36:50,875
I don't believe
he e-mailed sex offenders
by accident.

741
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:52,414
But if he spammed
the Internet,

742
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:54,244
odds are he's gonna
find a few freaks.

743
00:36:54,317 --> 00:36:56,046
BARTENDER: You want
what the Iady's having?

744
00:36:57,887 --> 00:36:59,821
I'II have ginger ale,
thanks.

745
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,123
As the wise man said,
I can resist everything
except temptation.

746
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:08,420
What did I say?

747
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:11,633
Hedges said
he tried to resist.

748
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,627
I wonder just how
much he was tempted.

749
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:19,935
How many times did Excel
e-mail you advertisements
for their porn?

750
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:21,801
I don't know.

751
00:37:21,877 --> 00:37:23,276
Think, Tommy,
how many?

752
00:37:23,346 --> 00:37:24,973
I don't know.
Maybe 50 or 60.

753
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,275
But you only
opened one?

754
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:27,509
Yeah.

755
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,744
Okay, what did you do
with the other ones?

756
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:31,480
I deleted them.

757
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:34,022
Did you ever ask Excel
to stop e-mailing you?

758
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,456
Yeah, I did.
I started selecting
the opt out option.

759
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:38,049
"Opt out"?
What's that?

760
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:39,788
It sends an e-mail back
to the company telling them

761
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:42,729
to take you off
their mailing Iist,
but it didn't work.

762
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:44,493
The e-mails kept coming.

763
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:50,805
My company employs
over 200 people

764
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:52,704
to deal with the thousands
who use our website.

765
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:58,873
You can't expect me to know
that one employee accidentally
overlooked a client's request.

766
00:37:58,948 --> 00:38:02,645
21 times in a row
is not an accident,
it's a policy.

767
00:38:02,718 --> 00:38:07,121
You bombarded a dangerous man
with provocative images
until he finally gave in.

768
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:11,250
That's a good try, AIex,

769
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:16,321
but a computerized oversight
is a Iong way from being
a smoking gun.

770
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:20,460
And, in case you've forgotten,
aggressive advertising isn't
against the Iaw.

771
00:38:21,837 --> 00:38:23,498
Fine.

772
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:25,699
We'II just see what
the jury has to say.

773
00:38:32,915 --> 00:38:36,078
I won't tell you
I Iike what my client
does for a Iiving.

774
00:38:36,986 --> 00:38:38,817
I abhor it.

775
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:42,346
But I will defend his right
to publish pornography

776
00:38:42,425 --> 00:38:46,794
because the protection
of free speech is vital
to our constitution.

777
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:51,559
The People have
made a great deal
out of a handful

778
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:56,731
of automated e-mail opt outs
Mr. Hedges sent
to Excel Entertainment.

779
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:59,832
But has she shown
one shred of proof

780
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:02,742
that my client
had any knowledge
of these messages?

781
00:39:02,812 --> 00:39:04,643
No, she has not.

782
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:08,249
Stanley Billings
published a story,

783
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:10,683
a work of the imagination,

784
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:16,089
a work which
the Supreme Court
has ruled is perfectly Iegal.

785
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:20,687
Mr. Billings did
not know Mr. Hedges.

786
00:39:21,464 --> 00:39:23,955
He did not know what
Mr. Hedges might do.

787
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:28,834
Therefore, he cannot be
held responsible for what
Mr. Hedges did.

788
00:39:30,773 --> 00:39:32,968
The Iaw holds
my client innocent.

789
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,407
So must you.

790
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:36,675
Thank you.

791
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:45,787
There is no doubt
that Tommy Hedges
killed Cherie Lathan,

792
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:49,715
but Stanley Billings
played a part
in her death also.

793
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:53,456
Now each of you knows
that he is morally guilty.

794
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:56,865
The question you
have to ask yourselves

795
00:39:56,932 --> 00:39:59,332
is if he is
Iegally guilty as well.

796
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,931
And the answer is yes.

797
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:06,099
Stanley Billings
put a deadly weapon
in Tommy Hedges' hands,

798
00:40:06,175 --> 00:40:08,803
and Tommy Hedges
asked him to stop.

799
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:13,781
Not once,
not a handful of times,
but 21 times.

800
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,145
And 21 times,
Stanley Billings ignored him.

801
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:22,146
Now as chief executive officer
of Excel Entertainment,

802
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:26,217
he is responsible for
his company's actions
and his company's inaction.

803
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:30,156
And when Hedges finally
succumbed to Billings'
hard-sell tactics,

804
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:35,499
Billings sold him instructions
on how to stalk,
kidnap and rape a child.

805
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:39,029
That makes Stanley Billings
an accomplice to rape,

806
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:41,838
and it makes him
a facilitator of murder.

807
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:49,183
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

808
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:51,082
We have, Your Honor.

809
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:55,317
We find the defendant,
Stanley Billings,
guilty of facilitation

810
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:57,586
in the murder
of Cherie Lathan.

811
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,922
(SPECTATORS GASPING)

812
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:01,425
(SIGHS)

813
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:04,157
They can't be serious.
I didn't do anything.

814
00:41:04,233 --> 00:41:05,598
Okay, Stanley.
Take it easy.

815
00:41:05,668 --> 00:41:06,794
Okay, but I'm innocent.

816
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:08,029
MOREDOCK: It's okay.

817
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:12,997
Here she is now.

818
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:15,669
AIex. Congratulations.

819
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:16,904
You're happy?

820
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:20,312
Why not? I'II get
the conviction
overturned on appeal.

821
00:41:20,382 --> 00:41:22,350
Enjoy it while you can.

822
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:25,410
You got the bad guy,
and you didn't stomp
on the constitution.

823
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:27,649
I couldn't have
taught you better myself.

824
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:31,420
Yeah, well, thousands
of people are still Iegally
viewing virtual child porn,

825
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:34,861
so maybe the constitution
could use some stomping.

826
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,127
Thousands of people
are protesting
the war and burning flags,

827
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,862
you want to
stomp on them, too?

828
00:41:40,936 --> 00:41:43,302
Where would it
all end, AIex?

829
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:44,999
Don't be upset.

830
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:48,009
In this case,
everybody won.

831
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:49,738
Not Cherie Lathan.
