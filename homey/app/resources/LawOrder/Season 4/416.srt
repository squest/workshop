00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:00,962
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:03,267
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,932
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,943
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:11,310
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:13,309
These are their stories.

7
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,146
We're good to go.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,208
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,309
Damn it.

10
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:22,790
I got to take this.

11
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,292
Make a sound,
and I'II cut your balls off.

12
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:30,231
Hi, sweetie.
What's wrong?

13
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,595
What the hell?

14
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:33,735
Mommy will be home soon.

15
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:36,863
Wake the sitter and have her
give you some cough medicine.

16
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,964
Mmm-hmm.
Where does it hurt?

17
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:40,335
Hey, can I get
my money back?

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,241
Oh, no. Your tummy
hurts you, too?

19
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:43,403
Screw you.

20
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:45,446
I'II be home...
I can find a hotter
piece of ass

21
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:47,210
with a Iot Iess baggage.

22
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:48,807
(CLATTERING)

23
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:51,815
Oh, my God.

24
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:56,555
My partner and I were
patrolling a block away
when we heard screaming.

25
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:57,615
You heard the attack?

26
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:59,320
No, no. The discovery.

27
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:01,295
Tough guy in the parka.

28
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:03,056
I didn't see anything.

29
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:06,394
STABLER: Sexually posed,
put on display.

30
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,437
Our boy wants to read
about this in the paper.

31
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:10,495
Ligature marks
around the neck.

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,469
No other apparent wounds.

33
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,433
Except for the skirt.

34
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:17,608
Wasn't short enough
for somebody.
It's been cut off.

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,978
We got blood on the boot.
Maybe she got a piece of him.

36
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,778
BENSON: I'II grab
an evidence bag.

37
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:28,121
Liv. I don't think
the blood's our perp's.

38
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,683
It's hers.

39
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,728
Guys, anyone find
a severed foot?

40
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:27,742
Stump's pretty
chewed up.

41
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:29,842
Sawed off,
as opposed to
one good hack.

42
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,079
Perp used a saw?

43
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:33,714
BIade wasn't that thick,
but it was serrated.

44
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,950
Based on the hesitation marks,
I'd say two millimeter width.

45
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,823
It's your garden-variety
kitchen knife.

46
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:41,295
Probably upper-end.
See the impression here?

47
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:42,661
It's from the hilt guard.

48
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,063
Only your better
knives have them.

49
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,124
He chop her pre
or post-mortem?

50
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:49,136
No bruising, minimal clotting,
so she was already dead

51
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:51,264
as a result of
Iigature strangulation.

52
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,570
Yeah, now that Iooks too thin
to be a belt or a rope.

53
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:55,702
WARNER: Wire. He thoughtfully
used enough force

54
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,507
to show me that
it was braided.

55
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,512
Ten threads,
12 or 14 gauge.

56
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:01,880
Can you be a Iittle bit
more specific?

57
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:06,045
It Ieft no visible residue,
but if we get a reaction
with rubionic acid...

58
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,315
WARNER: It was copper.

59
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,155
Well, she was found
in the red Iight district.

60
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,821
If she was on the stroll,
we've probably got her prints.

61
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:15,090
No hits.

62
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:18,191
AIso, no STDs
or cervical dysplasia.

63
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:19,632
She probably
wasn't a pro.

64
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:22,102
So, all we have is
Asian, mid-twenties.

65
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,128
With a painful past.

66
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:27,175
I found healed burn marks
on the genitals.

67
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,571
We've seen that
before. Cigarettes?

68
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,838
More conducive with
an electro-shock device.

69
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:33,313
And then there's this.

70
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:37,216
See the nine metacarpal bones,
making up the wrist?

71
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:38,953
Hers are disrupted.

72
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:42,257
She also has old tears
to her rotator cuffs.

73
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:45,189
She was hung by her wrists.

74
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:46,756
And tortured.

75
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:49,758
CRAGEN: Are we thinking
the guy who tortured her
in the past

76
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:51,026
finished the job Iast night?

77
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,567
Well, those scars are
a couple of years old.

78
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:54,569
That's a pretty big gap
between the attacks.

79
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:56,696
Assuming the first go-around
was an attack.

80
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,740
They sure as hell
weren't self-inflicted.

81
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:00,708
Nothing with
Missing Persons yet.

82
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:04,576
Restraints, painful game
of shock the kitty.
Smacks of S&M to me.

83
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:06,739
I know one woman's pain
can be another man's pleasure,

84
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:08,681
but this girl was not
spanked to death.

85
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:09,911
Say she hooks up
with a guy.

86
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,351
She's down with
the whips and chains,

87
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,786
but she bolts when he
revs up the cattle prod.

88
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:16,882
I don't know. George,
bondage/discipline
track for you?

89
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,551
These old scars
are political torture.

90
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:19,959
STABLER:
Where do you get that?

91
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,692
They're trademark techniques
used by the Chinese military
occupying Tibet.

92
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:24,926
I'd say she was Tibetan.

93
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:27,168
Meaning that she had
the audacity to support

94
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:29,033
the Dalai Lama
or an independent Tibet.

95
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:31,232
Maybe she was a nun.
I understand they're
a favorite target.

96
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:32,797
Right, Agent Huang?

97
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:36,874
According to Physicians
for Human Rights,
of which I'm a member.

98
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:38,675
CRAGEN: Maybe cutting off
the foot was a message.

99
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:40,773
Could a torturer have
followed her here?

100
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,839
Anything's possible.

101
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,715
AII right, then maybe
she came seeking
political asylum.

102
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:46,254
Check with the INS.

103
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:49,755
JOHNSON: Do you have any idea
how many immigrants
we get a year?

104
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:51,690
We're really only
interested in one.

105
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:54,924
A million,
10% of whom claim to be
political refugees.

106
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:57,999
But then there's
the million and a half
who try to sneak in illegally.

107
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,331
Gee, it's almost Iike
someone hung out a sign,
welcoming

108
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,394
your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses,
and then they...

109
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,870
Hey, we got a hit.

110
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:08,903
FIN: Kunsong Tashi.
Huang was right.

111
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,343
Birthplace, Tibet.

112
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:11,937
Was she granted
political asylum?

113
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:14,380
Never applied.
She got in on
a marriage visa.

114
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,476
So there's a husband
in the picture.
What's his name?

115
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:20,087
Preston Bennett.

116
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,716
BENSON: How did
you two meet?

117
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:29,495
(SNIFFLES) At the bazaar
at Dharamsala.

118
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:33,195
I found a 10th century
stone Vishnu,

119
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,998
but the merchant
spoke no English.

120
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:38,365
Kunsong was walking by,
and she interpreted for us.

121
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:44,339
And your relationship now
was still strong?

122
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:47,377
We never fought,
not once.

123
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,048
Mr. Bennett,
I got to tell you,
I find it awfully odd

124
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,281
that you didn't
report her missing.

125
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:55,913
I assumed she was
at the Center.

126
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:57,515
BENSON:
Which center is that?

127
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,153
It's a program at Bellevue
for torture survivors.

128
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,594
She was tortured
in Tibet?

129
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,935
Yes. For attending
a demonstration.

130
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:11,095
The police came,
rounded everyone up.

131
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:12,367
They kept her a month.

132
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,573
This center
that you mentioned,

133
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:16,577
was she having trouble
with anybody there?

134
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,306
No, it was a godsend.

135
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:20,577
We found it when
she first got here.

136
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:23,379
It helped her so much,
now she volunteers there.

137
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:25,818
Was she in the habit of
staying there all night?

138
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,219
She was there
constantly.

139
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,622
She had group therapy,
she interpreted.

140
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:34,322
And whenever a new survivor
entered the program,
she'd sit with them.

141
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:35,489
AII night?

142
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:36,620
Sometimes.

143
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,030
Without calling?

144
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:40,726
Yes.

145
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:44,430
I'm not buying it.

146
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:45,701
Kathy didn't come home
all night,

147
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:46,969
I'd be out
Iooking for her.

148
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:48,304
That's you.
That's everybody.

149
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:49,401
That's bull.

150
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:51,412
How many times have
we been working on a case

151
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,606
and Kathy doesn't
hear from you?

152
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:53,875
That's different.
I'm on the job.

153
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,213
Well, according
to her husband,
so was Kunsong.

154
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:03,856
She'd spend hours Iistening
to victims' horror stories,

155
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:05,291
even though
it usually meant

156
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,953
opening up
old wounds
of her own.

157
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,360
We saw the scars.

158
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:11,358
(SIGHS) They don't begin
to tell the story.

159
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,425
In prison, she was
stripped naked,

160
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:17,702
held in a small cage
for days without food,
and beaten around the clock.

161
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:19,900
As if the taser
to the genitals
wasn't enough.

162
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:22,307
EIectro-shock batons
are a favorite.

163
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:24,475
Not only is
the pain unbearable,

164
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,242
they don't Ieave
physical scars.

165
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,304
They did on Kunsong.

166
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:30,216
Only because the guard
raping her got careless

167
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,446
and exceeded
the mandated voltage.

168
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:35,285
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

169
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,059
Our Tibetan support group
is about to start.

170
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,891
They wanted to
have a memorial.

171
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:42,664
This was Kunsong's group?

172
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:45,222
Yes.
They consider her family.

173
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:50,731
She made this for them.

174
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:53,005
Group meet yesterday?

175
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,669
No. But she was here
in the afternoon,

176
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:58,269
helping to translate
affidavits for asylum.

177
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,478
She Ieft around 5:00.
BENSON: AIone?

178
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:03,541
Yes. I wish I had asked
her where she was going.

179
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,780
What do you know
about her husband?

180
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:08,956
There was no marital discord.

181
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:11,250
Really?

182
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:15,160
It's hard to believe that
somebody who went through

183
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:18,257
what Kunsong did
would have an easy time
in a relationship.

184
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:20,569
Preston cared
about her deeply.

185
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,935
If anything, he was
overly protective.

186
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:26,337
Who did Kunsong
need protection from?

187
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,702
Attention, everyone.

188
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:30,972
We'II be starting in
just a minute, okay?

189
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:34,478
Who did Kunsong
need protection from?

190
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:36,809
You have to understand,

191
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,946
the purpose of torture
is to break a person's will

192
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,886
and destroy their humanity.

193
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,988
Some degree of paranoia
is not uncommon.

194
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,493
Well, seeing how
Kunsong died,

195
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,621
maybe her fears
weren't all in her head.

196
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,858
Nearly half a million
survivors of torture

197
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,798
have relocated to the U.S.

198
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:56,668
There's no telling how many
of their tormentors
have followed suit.

199
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,434
Did she mention
any run-ins?

200
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,476
No, but she had become
more of an activist recently.

201
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:02,602
STABLER: How so?

202
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:05,306
A fellow survivor from group,
Detchen Gyatso,

203
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,506
took her to her first protest
just Iast week.

204
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,880
Is Detchen here?

205
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:11,215
No, but I know where
you can find her.

206
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:12,276
DETCHEN: Freedom for Tibet!

207
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:13,582
MUNCH: I'd say
she's our organizer.

208
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,055
Freedom for Tibet!

209
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,557
Freedom for Tibet!

210
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,616
Freedom for...
Detchen Gyatso?

211
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,456
We have a right
to be here.

212
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:21,587
We're not blocking traffic

213
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:24,098
and we're not obstructing
China's corrupt,
oppressive regime.

214
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,997
MUNCH: Hey, hey,
more power to you.

215
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:27,559
What do you want?

216
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,035
Want to talk to you
about Kunsong.

217
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:31,197
I understand she started
fighting the good fight
just Iast week.

218
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,036
Was it right out here
in front of the consulate?

219
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,837
No, a brokerage firm.

220
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:36,274
Myer Miller's.

221
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:38,836
A new stock offering
is funding a pipeline
through Tibet.

222
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:40,142
But we are hurting them.

223
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:44,117
The parent company has already
reduced their U.S. sale
from seven to five billion.

224
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:46,279
I've seen men killed
for a pizza.

225
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:48,422
Billions at stake?
That's motive for murder.

226
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,481
Anybody roughed up
at Iast week's soiree?

227
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,857
We're talking Times Square,
not Tiananmen.

228
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:54,623
Not even an idle threat?

229
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:57,598
Jerks didn't even
call the cops.
No arrests, no ink.

230
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,825
Only person taken away
all day was Kunsong.

231
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:00,891
MUNCH: By whom?

232
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,301
Her husband.

233
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:04,004
He showed up,
pulled her out of Iine.

234
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:06,337
He was yelling,
she was crying.

235
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:09,106
She didn't get to
finish the protest.

236
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,570
As I recall, the husband
stated they'd never fight.

237
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,741
Wonder what his
Iittle demonstration
was all about.

238
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:16,216
DETCHEN: Freedom for Tibet!

239
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:17,913
Freedom for...

240
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:19,042
Well?

241
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:20,554
It wasn't a fight.

242
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,783
You dragged your wife away
in tears in front of
a hundred witnesses.

243
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,224
A week before her murder.

244
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,455
You don't understand.
Oh, we understand
that you Iied to us.

245
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,655
I was just trying
to protect her.

246
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,097
Yeah? From what?
Facing her fears,
or moving on?

247
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,191
The more independent she grew,
the Iess control you had?

248
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:34,360
It was too soon.

249
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:35,460
To get on with her Iife?

250
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:38,438
We were at the end of our
three-year probation period
with the INS.

251
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:42,273
If she had been arrested,
she could have been
deported back to hell.

252
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,605
Dug up something
on your boy here.

253
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:48,741
Turns out he has
a history with us.

254
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:52,109
What? I've never been
arrested in my Iife.

255
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:55,951
No. But a patrol car
responded to a 911 call
at your residence.

256
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,719
What was that?
Another fight you never had?

257
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:02,121
A neighbor misinterpreted
something he heard.

258
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:04,688
Kunsong screaming
bloody murder
in the middle of the night.

259
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,325
On a regular basis.

260
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:07,833
How's that open
to interpretation?

261
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,632
She had nightmares!

262
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:13,430
She tried everything,
even sleeping upright
in a chair.

263
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:16,609
Still, she'd wake up
thinking she was
back in Tibet.

264
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,737
The nightmares were so real,

265
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:20,407
even with me holding her,
she couldn't stop screaming.

266
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:22,211
Well, someone shut her up.

267
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,814
With a wire across
her vocal chords.

268
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:28,383
I'm a Buddhist,
for God's sake.

269
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,981
I could never take a Iife.

270
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:32,356
That's funny.
I talked to the neighbor
that reported you.

271
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:34,293
I guess you forgot
your pacifist crap

272
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,490
when you threatened him
the next day.

273
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,395
Do you have any idea
how much trauma he caused her?

274
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:39,798
BENSON: By calling the police?

275
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,098
Two men in uniform, showing up
in the middle of the night,

276
00:11:42,171 --> 00:11:44,571
that's how nightmares begin
where she's from.

277
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,235
And unless this is
a police state, too,
I assume I'm free to Ieave.

278
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,815
He's Iying.

279
00:11:58,187 --> 00:11:59,449
STABLER: Husband
is a broken record.

280
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:00,920
Every problem we find
in their marriage,

281
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:03,219
he explains away with
his wife's horrible past.

282
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,385
He may Iie,
but paper trails don't.

283
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,725
He take out
an insurance policy
on Kunsong?

284
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:09,229
There's nothing.
As far as I can tell,

285
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:11,027
he's not making a penny
from her death.

286
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,863
How we doing on
shaking his alibi?

287
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:15,699
CIaims he was home alone.
I haven't found a soul
to confirm that.

288
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:17,102
You pull his LUDs?

289
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:19,037
Night of the murder,
not a single call.

290
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,302
Of course not.
He wasn't there.

291
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,740
Well, it doesn't
prove he wasn't.

292
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,801
Well, this does.
I pulled Preston's
financials.

293
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,074
There's a charge
on his corporate card
at 6:00 that night.

294
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:28,173
CRAGEN: Where?
A place called Hello Dalai.

295
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,241
What is that?
BENSON: I've been there.

296
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:32,420
It's a Iittle
Tibetan restaurant
in the Village.

297
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:37,624
FIN: You recognize
Mr. Bennett?

298
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:39,684
Sure. He and his wife
are regulars.

299
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:40,990
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

300
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:42,826
He hasn't been here
in a couple of weeks.

301
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:45,560
According to his
credit card company,
he was here Iast Tuesday.

302
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:47,864
You've got it backwards.
His wife was, he wasn't.

303
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,096
You sure about that?

304
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:51,469
Positive. It was before
the dinner rush.

305
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,700
They were the only ones
in here.

306
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:53,901
They?

307
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,601
She was with a gentleman.
MUNCH: Describe him.

308
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:58,111
Brown hair, thirtyish.

309
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,205
Scars, tattoos,
anything unusual?

310
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:03,940
Perfect tan in February
kind of stood out.
That and his hefty tip.

311
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,782
Wait a minute. That was
her husband's card,

312
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,685
so she would've had
to sign for the meal.

313
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,314
No, I'm sure he signed.

314
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:11,188
FIN: Think you still
got that receipt?

315
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,318
I'II check.

316
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:14,593
Husband's definitely
got motive now.

317
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,789
Not only was she
cheating on him,

318
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,923
she was using his money
to wine and dine her Iover.

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,365
Guy's sure got
a set on him.

320
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:21,834
Signing the husband's card?
That's cold.

321
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:23,701
I'm the manager.
Is there a problem?

322
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,740
Well, for starters,
a case of identity theft.

323
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:28,936
Someone other than
Mr. Bennett signed
a receipt Tuesday night.

324
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:30,308
You mean Mr. Chambers.

325
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,313
He's an authorized signer
on that card.

326
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,609
Who the hell's Mr. Chambers?

327
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,206
Mr. Bennett's partner.

328
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:37,252
He's the "C"
in B & C Importers.

329
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:39,877
Mr. Bennett's
business partner.

330
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:41,684
The triangle thickens.

331
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:44,889
STABLER: Ryan Chambers?
Yes.

332
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,019
BENSON: Like to talk to you
about Kunsong Bennett.

333
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:48,528
Do you mind
if we come in?

334
00:13:48,597 --> 00:13:49,655
This really isn't
a good time.

335
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:51,426
STABLER: Well, you know,
for us, either.

336
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,435
We would've preferred
to talk to you the day
her body was discovered.

337
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:58,269
But at the time,
we hadn't yet heard about
your torrid Iittle affair.

338
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:00,066
What are you talking about?

339
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,973
STABLER: Preston know
you were banging his wife?

340
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:04,774
(SCOFFS) I doubt it,
since I wasn't.

341
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,380
You got a sense of humor.
That's good.

342
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:08,848
That'II serve you well
in prison.

343
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:10,542
What?

344
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,814
You were the Iast person
who saw her alive.

345
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:14,185
You're going to need
to come with us.

346
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,417
PRESTON:
That won't be necessary.

347
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:25,329
So the marriage was a sham.

348
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:27,600
Did Kunsong know?

349
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:29,261
Of course she did.

350
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:31,272
But we really did
care for each other.

351
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:34,102
That's why I married her.
It was the only way
to bring her here.

352
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:35,268
STABLER: You cared so much,

353
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:38,279
why have you been obstructing
her murder investigation?

354
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:39,473
I panicked.

355
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:42,176
You have to understand.
I violated federal
immigration Iaws.

356
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:43,718
The INS could
put him in prison.

357
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:45,343
Not to mention
take away our business.

358
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,910
You don't want us
to fill them in,

359
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,184
then I suggest you tell us
what happened that night.

360
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:52,625
If I had any information
about her killer,
I would have told you.

361
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:54,389
What happened at dinner?

362
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,863
Nothing.
We had a quick bite,

363
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,593
went our separate ways.
I came home and Preston
was already here.

364
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:01,260
It was a bury-the-hatchet
dinner.

365
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:03,167
You and Kunsong
had problems?

366
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:05,297
She was very sweet,
but it was going on
three years.

367
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:06,932
It was putting a strain
on our relationship.

368
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,442
Which she sensed.

369
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:10,644
That's why she moved out.

370
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:11,736
She what?

371
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:13,212
We put the apartment
in my name,

372
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:15,182
so the INS
wouldn't find out.

373
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,250
BENSON: How's it going, guys?

374
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:21,016
No sign of blood.

375
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,550
No sign of a struggle.

376
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,627
Not much to disturb.

377
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:29,731
Free Tibet. She was
disturbing someone.

378
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,756
BENSON: Got a notepad.
Yeah?

379
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:33,596
Nothing. Just a grocery Iist.

380
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:34,658
Bag it.

381
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,536
ANSWERING MACHINE:
You have no messages.

382
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:40,808
Guess she wasn't
real popular.
CIassifieds.

383
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:44,104
She was Iooking
to buy used furniture.

384
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,544
She needed it.

385
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:48,844
She had two stars
by a floral,
shabby-chic couch.

386
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,053
She was going
to see this one.

387
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,486
The day she died.

388
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:58,394
She called. I told her
to come by after 6:00.

389
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,454
I was here all night,
she never showed.

390
00:16:00,532 --> 00:16:02,090
She was having dinner
four blocks from here.

391
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,725
It would've been
right on her way.

392
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,235
I don't know
what to tell you.

393
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:07,430
This is not the couch
in your ad.

394
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:09,173
I sold it.
To whom?

395
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:13,039
Some sorority chick.
I don't know, Buffy,
Cindy, something Iike that.

396
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:14,135
She paid cash.

397
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:15,736
Mostly women
answer your ad?

398
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:16,872
Yeah.

399
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:20,081
You don't strike me
as a floral, shabby-chic
kind of guy.

400
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:23,552
I'm not.
That's why I sold it.
It belonged to my ex.

401
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,418
Now, why would she
Ieave a catch Iike you?

402
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,516
'Cause she's a whore.
And she found a fatter wallet.

403
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:29,855
That knife collection hers?

404
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:32,396
That worthless bitch
couldn't boil water.

405
00:16:34,232 --> 00:16:35,529
Those are mine.

406
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:38,225
It's a perfect scam.

407
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:40,503
I mean, how many other ways
do you get women

408
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:43,473
to walk voluntarily into
a complete stranger's home?

409
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:47,039
Big bang for the buck.
CIassifieds are,
what, $5 a Iine?

410
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:49,012
Do we even know
this couch existed?

411
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,809
We're trying to
track down the ex.

412
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:52,110
What do we have
on this guy?

413
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:54,879
Paulie Obregano.
Two drunk and disorderlies,
but that was awhile ago.

414
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:56,079
Well, if he's
a mean drunk,

415
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:58,145
his wife Ieaving
would give him
an ax to grind.

416
00:16:58,223 --> 00:16:59,884
(PHONE RINGING)
Against a pretty
Iittle ankle bone.

417
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,823
Yeah, he had
the carving knives
to do it.

418
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:02,917
Benson, SVU.

419
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:04,154
It's all circumstantial.

420
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:06,527
We're gonna need
a Iot more than that
to get a search warrant.

421
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:09,863
That was the Iab.
They already have
something on the boots.

422
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:13,095
What've we got?
DNA? Prints?

423
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:15,669
No. But something's
definitely afoot.

424
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:17,833
These are a size nine.

425
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:19,542
I checked to make sure
it wasn't mismarked.

426
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:20,600
STABLER: Why?

427
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,976
Well, the victim's foot
measured nine and
three sixteenths inches.

428
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,539
That would make her
a size six and a half.

429
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,809
She was wearing shoes
two and a half sizes too big?

430
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:30,753
Hold on, these are
Jacques Le Corre.
These are $700 boots.

431
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:32,312
I mean, maybe
they were on sale, but...

432
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,914
Wouldn't that be
really uncomfortable?

433
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:37,120
Only if she bought
these boots for walking,
which she never did.

434
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:38,492
BENSON: They've got
wear marks right here.

435
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:39,723
TREVOR: Not where
they should be.

436
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:40,890
These roll to the outside.

437
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:43,934
According to
the autopsy report,
she was pigeon-toed.

438
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:45,930
These weren't her boots.

439
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:52,032
Some Prince Charming
slipped one of your shoes
on our victim.

440
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,805
Is there any kind
of hidden Iot number

441
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:55,436
that could tell us where
that shoe was purchased?

442
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:56,605
Sorry, no.

443
00:17:56,815 --> 00:17:59,215
Surely you must have
some way of tracking
your inventory.

444
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:00,945
That would be
on the shoebox.

445
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,646
Well, how many stores
are we talking about?

446
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,188
We're only carried
by the most exclusive.

447
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,226
Of course, given their
multiple chain Iocations
in the tri-state area,

448
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:10,659
about a thousand.

449
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12,420
Every store carry
every design?

450
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:15,591
Every buyer carries
shoes that appeal to
their store's demographics.

451
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,157
Who stocks this one?

452
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:18,827
No one.

453
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:22,131
It's a prototype.
It's not due to hit shelves
for another month.

454
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:23,333
Who had access to it?

455
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:25,342
Laurie Schneider
reps that account.

456
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,207
Could you point us her way?

457
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:28,534
And go.

458
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:31,340
Okay, that's my Iast
model for this run.
I've got two minutes.

459
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,247
What can I tell you
about the Bellanobla model?

460
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:35,548
You know about a pair
walking off by themselves?

461
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,712
Size nine.

462
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:39,022
Crystal's our only
model that size.

463
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,853
She wore them
in a show Iast month.

464
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:42,517
Models get to keep
everything else in Iife.

465
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:44,084
They get to keep
the shoes, too?

466
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:45,493
They're not
supposed to, but...

467
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:46,552
Where can we find her?

468
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,655
LAURIE: Milan.

469
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:50,859
How can we contact her there?

470
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:52,330
Is that really necessary?

471
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:55,270
Did we mention that this is
a murder investigation?

472
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,769
Okay, she didn't
take them, I did.

473
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,276
For what I thought
was a hot date.

474
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:01,937
What, he knock
your boots off?

475
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:04,811
Trust me, this Ioser
didn't touch
anything of mine.

476
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:06,043
You know where he took me?

477
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:07,982
The Rock 'n' Roll Bowl.
MUNCH: Very trendy.

478
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,542
It's a bowling alley.

479
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:11,714
And just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse,

480
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,051
my boots disappeared.

481
00:19:13,124 --> 00:19:14,250
Somebody jacked the boots?

482
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,520
Yes. It was
20 degrees outside.

483
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:18,893
I had to ride home
in my stocking feet.

484
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:20,453
At Ieast you got to keep
both of yours.

485
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:22,830
The next woman
wasn't so Iucky.

486
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:26,729
Yeah, I remember her.
She was really unhappy
with her date.

487
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:28,362
Totally hitting on me.

488
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,873
Really? Now, was that here
at the counter, or did she

489
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,000
Iure you down
to her Iane?

490
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:34,169
No, no. I was working
concessions that night.

491
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:36,008
I delivered several
pitchers of beer
to the Iady.

492
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,911
STABLER: How often do shoes
get stolen from here?

493
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:40,849
Hey, Jerry, we got
a pin stuck on Iane 17.
You wanna get on that?

494
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,547
BENSON: Hey, Marshall,
you didn't answer
the question.

495
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:45,715
Lots of shoes go missing
on your watch?

496
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,554
Well, no, they don't go
missing that often. But...

497
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:51,094
I mean, we get kids
playing pranks and stuff.

498
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:53,790
But between you and me,
I mean, that Iady
was so toasted

499
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:56,333
she probably dropped them
down the ball return.

500
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,198
Hey, buddy, buddy,

501
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,268
what's it Iike working
for Marshall the Kingpin?

502
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,772
I hate that guy.

503
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,068
You hate him?

504
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:06,872
He annoy the customers
as much as he annoys you?

505
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:10,476
Yeah, he hits on every girl
that walks through that door.
It's pathetic.

506
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:11,776
Oh, really?

507
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,547
I'm guessing he sees
a Iot of rejection.

508
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,780
Nothing but.
He never gets anywhere.

509
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:19,515
Well, aside from
this bad habit

510
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,525
of harassing women,
you ever see him

511
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:23,788
taking things that
don't belong to him?

512
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:29,195
I wouldn't put it past him.

513
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:31,265
STABLER: Yeah, go ahead.

514
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:35,231
Okay, any record of
bowling-alley guy
crossing the foul Iine?

515
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:36,364
He's clean.

516
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,136
He's young.
Maybe he hasn't
been caught yet.

517
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:39,972
Or maybe he hasn't
been reported yet.

518
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,477
I mean, who's going to
go to all the trouble

519
00:20:41,546 --> 00:20:43,514
of reporting a pair
of stolen shoes?

520
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:45,981
You'd be surprised.
I pulled 61s on all crimes

521
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,041
where shoes came into play
in any way.

522
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,053
What, every pin
is a stolen shoe?

523
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:51,486
Not necessarily.

524
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:53,854
MUNCH: AII the red pins
represent the robberies
and the B and E's.

525
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:56,723
It doesn't make sense.
I mean, why break in
and just take shoes?

526
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,728
Because you got
a shoe fetish.

527
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:00,487
It's a sexual philia where

528
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:04,365
arousal is triggered by shoes,
feet, or even smelly socks.

529
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:05,795
That's one
I've never gotten.

530
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,303
HUANG: There are
plenty of theories.

531
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:08,361
It could just be
cross-wiring.

532
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,963
In the control map
of the brain,

533
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,406
the genitals are
right next to the feet.

534
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:15,105
More importantly,
are any of these break-ins
near the bowling alley?

535
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,410
The Rock 'n' Roll Bowl is here
in one of the Ieast hit areas.

536
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,451
He have any connection
to the Village?

537
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:22,076
'Cause that's our
heaviest concentration.

538
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,713
No. But Paulie,
the couch guy, does.

539
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,279
He Iives at

540
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,691
462 East Houston.

541
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:31,887
That's dead in the middle.

542
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:33,487
CRAGEN: What's the green pin?

543
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:35,530
MUNCH: Physical assault.
HUANG: Really?

544
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:38,392
Shoe fetishism isn't
usually a violent paraphilia.

545
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:40,835
An NYU graduate student,
Greta Thorsen,

546
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:43,533
two weeks ago, was choked
into unconsciousness.

547
00:21:43,608 --> 00:21:46,042
And when she woke up,
her shoes were gone.

548
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,237
CRAGEN: She give
a description?
Couldn't.

549
00:21:48,546 --> 00:21:51,743
Pull Paulie's
driver's Iicense photo.
Throw it into a photo array,

550
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:53,511
see if it jogs a memory.

551
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:55,983
GRETA: I don't know
what else I can tell you.

552
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:57,783
But I'm going to be
Iate for class.

553
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,755
Those are nice
running shoes.

554
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:03,516
I'm 5'1", but no one knew
I was short because
I used to Iive in heels.

555
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:05,061
Now I'm afraid to wear them.

556
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:06,460
Is that since
the attack?

557
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:08,965
That bastard took
three inches off my Iife.

558
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:10,364
I'm not even
the same person.

559
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:12,960
I promise, helping us
is going to help you.

560
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,130
Now, tell us
everything you know.

561
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:16,430
It was dark.

562
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:19,203
I didn't see anyone around.
I was almost to my dorm.

563
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:21,507
AII of a sudden
there were hands
around my throat.

564
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:23,513
Do you recognize
any of these men?

565
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:26,880
I told you, he came up
from behind me.
I never saw his face.

566
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:29,151
Did he press up against you?

567
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,245
I tried to pull away.
He jerked me back.

568
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:33,017
My head hit his chin.

569
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,385
You're 5'4" with heels.
That would make him between

570
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:38,156
5'8" and 5'10".

571
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:39,728
STABLER: Can you walk us
through that day?

572
00:22:39,797 --> 00:22:41,025
I was in classes
all day Iong

573
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,532
with about a million
other students.

574
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,828
Did you go off campus?

575
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,562
Just to the bakery
at Houston and Sullivan.

576
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:48,127
I was on my way
back from there
when it happened.

577
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:49,332
I got to go.

578
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:52,635
Paulie Iives on Houston.

579
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,938
Two blocks away.

580
00:22:57,682 --> 00:22:59,741
MRS. KRUG: Greta
hasn't been in,
in a few weeks.

581
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:02,342
But she used to
come in at night
to stock up on muffins.

582
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,012
She hates
that dorm food.

583
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:06,454
Do you know this much
about all of your customers?

584
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:08,617
It's a real
neighborhood bakery.

585
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:11,388
I know just about everybody
in a ten-block radius.

586
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:14,090
By order, mind you,
not necessarily by name.

587
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,430
BENSON: This girl's name
is Kunsong.

588
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:21,496
No.

589
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:23,669
No, I don't think
she's been in here.

590
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,606
How many employees
do you have working here?

591
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:28,839
Just Michael and Rodney.
But they're good guys.

592
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:30,642
And who's this?
MRS. KRUG: Brendan.

593
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:34,409
No. You'II ruin
your appetite.
He's my boy.

594
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:37,584
Any of these men customers?

595
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,852
(SIGHS)

596
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:43,315
This one.

597
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:45,620
That's pumpernickel
and olive Ioaf.

598
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:46,958
You've got your mom's
good memory.

599
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,726
Do either one of you remember

600
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,893
if he came in here
on the night of January 15th?

601
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:54,904
Two weeks ago? Well, no,
that I can't tell you.

602
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:56,769
But he is a regular.

603
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:04,405
Seriously, how Iong you
gonna keep jamming me up here?

604
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,448
BENSON: I don't know, Paulie.
That's up to you.

605
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:09,184
How would it help?

606
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,051
Louder or slower?
I didn't do anything.

607
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:19,457
We've got a murdered girl.

608
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,896
Our medical examiner
places her time of death

609
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:23,593
smack dab in the period

610
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,460
she was scheduled
to be in your apartment.

611
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:26,594
Coincidence.

612
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:28,366
We've got another girl,
attacked two weeks ago

613
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:30,236
after Ieaving one of
your favorite haunts.

614
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:33,004
Where?
Bakery, two blocks
from your apartment.

615
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:34,601
You know how many
people go in there?

616
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,078
That place is
always crammed.

617
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:37,444
Well, we also have a slew

618
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:40,006
of very peculiar burglaries
in your neighborhood.

619
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:41,278
This is unbelievable.

620
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:43,752
My thieving
whore of an ex
robs me blind,

621
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:45,584
and you accuse me
of stealing?

622
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,693
What do I gotta do
to prove to you

623
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:52,956
I've got nothing
to do with this?

624
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:54,993
Let us search
your apartment.

625
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,158
Fine.

626
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:01,896
BENSON: So what did we get?

627
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:04,840
Nothing indicating
Kunsong ever set foot
in Paulie's apartment.

628
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:06,604
We dusted floor to ceiling,
vacuumed the carpet.

629
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:08,372
Not a matching print,
hair or fiber.

630
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:09,435
What about
the knives?

631
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:11,209
No blood. There,
or in any of his drains.

632
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:12,715
Well, they told us
that you found something.

633
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:14,182
In her apartment,
not his.

634
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:15,583
Detectives,
remember the notepad

635
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:17,086
you picked up
by the victim's phone?

636
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:18,485
The one with
the grocery Iist
on it, yeah.

637
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:20,285
You find something
else there?
Nothing yet.

638
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:22,724
But the EIectrostatic
Detection Apparatus
can recover indented

639
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:25,057
writing three,
even four pages,
beneath the original.

640
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:27,654
Now, we vacuum Iock it
to the plate

641
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:30,928
and subject it
to a high-voltage
static charge.

642
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:33,997
Giving us a variably
charged surface

643
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:37,302
with the heavier static charge
remaining in any impressions,

644
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:39,776
which will attract this toner.

645
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:45,280
Which should give us
a carbon copy of the original.

646
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:46,540
CARLISLE: Yep.

647
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,816
Just Iike this.

648
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:53,350
Does "Couch, 642 East Houston,
apartment 2A,

649
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:54,449
"after 6:00" mean
anything to you?

650
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:55,955
Damn it, that's
Paulie's home address.

651
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:57,655
No, it isn't.

652
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,920
His is 462.

653
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,862
She inverted the numbers.

654
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:05,560
STABLER: Well,
who the hell Iives there?

655
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,706
It's right next door
to the bakery.

656
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:10,332
It's Ieading to
the apartment upstairs.

657
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:11,774
Hey, Detectives.

658
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:13,945
You're just in time
for fresh banana bread.

659
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:15,377
That sounds great.

660
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:18,143
Listen, can you tell us
who Iives above the bakery?

661
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:19,205
I do.

662
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:23,787
Well, you didn't
recognize her
as a customer.

663
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:27,649
Maybe she came by that day
Iooking for used furniture?

664
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:31,326
Well, I don't know
why she would.
I wasn't selling any.

665
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:33,125
Well, is there
a Mr. Krug?

666
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,691
Somewhere.

667
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:37,861
So it's just you
and your son Brendan?

668
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:39,460
And his half-brother.

669
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:42,365
My son from my
first marriage. Jerry.

670
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:46,440
Hey, Jerry,
come out here, please.

671
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:48,501
What, Ma?

672
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,449
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Jerry.

673
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:00,423
We did a very
thorough search
of your room.

674
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:01,516
We found
your secret stash.

675
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:03,117
You had no right
to touch my things.

676
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:04,594
Your things?
These aren't your things.

677
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:05,721
We've already
tied half of them

678
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,094
to burglaries in
your neighborhood.

679
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:08,655
We talked
to your mom.

680
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:12,670
She said that she found you
wearing a pair Iike this
when you were five.

681
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:15,234
I'm not gay.

682
00:27:15,974 --> 00:27:18,135
I just Iike the way
that they Iook.

683
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:21,775
On women.
So I collect them.
It's harmless.

684
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:23,209
It's harmless?

685
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,215
What happened to
the college student
who was wearing these?

686
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:30,544
You nearly
choked her to death.

687
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:32,484
I don't know.

688
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:35,518
BENSON: You followed her
from the bakery.

689
00:27:35,694 --> 00:27:37,958
Just to see where she Iived,

690
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,327
so that I could go
get them Iater.

691
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,796
Look, I swear, I swear,

692
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:47,033
this is the first time
that I ever hurt anybody.

693
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,264
But not the Iast.

694
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,774
Her name is Kunsong.

695
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:55,278
We found her blood
in your mom's delivery van.

696
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:58,214
We know that you used
that van to dump her body.

697
00:28:00,118 --> 00:28:01,278
We also know

698
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,345
that she came
to your apartment
by accident,

699
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:06,255
Iooking to buy a couch.

700
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:11,885
(SIGHS)

701
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:19,027
STABLER: Does that help?

702
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:35,685
She was Iike something
out of my dreams.

703
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,848
So I invited her in.

704
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:46,220
She just had the most
perfect, tiny feet.

705
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:50,763
AII I did was compliment her.

706
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:54,499
Things were going
really well, too,

707
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:56,666
until she asked
where the couch was.

708
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:59,536
AII right. And so then
what happened?

709
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:02,136
She ran for the door.

710
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:04,945
I stopped her.

711
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,778
I asked her to try on
a pair of shoes for me.

712
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,586
She told me I was sick.

713
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:20,690
I snapped.

714
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,258
You didn't mean to kill her.

715
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:26,668
No. No, no. One minute,
I'm sitting at home alone

716
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:29,898
fixing the TV,
and the next minute,
there's a dead girl.

717
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:32,844
You were rewiring your TV?

718
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:34,003
Yeah.

719
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,539
You use copper wire
for that, right?

720
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:39,948
We found the knife
that you used on her foot,

721
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:41,280
back in your mom's bakery.

722
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:43,548
It was nice of you
to bring it back.

723
00:29:45,557 --> 00:29:46,546
BENSON: Jerry...

724
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:50,927
Why did you cut
her foot off?

725
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,032
For my collection.

726
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:03,474
They just Iooked...

727
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:07,203
They just Iooked better
with a real foot.

728
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:18,456
CABOT: We need to serve
the motions to Talbot

729
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:20,957
and pull the statements
on the Simpson
and Powell cases.

730
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:22,960
Oh, AIex, yoo-hoo.
Hi, Gina.

731
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:24,518
I'II see you back
at the office.
AII right.

732
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:25,620
Hi.

733
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:26,891
Nice shoes.

734
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:28,626
Thanks.
I hate them, too.

735
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,602
But more importantly,
so does Jerry Dupree,
my shoe fetishist.

736
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:34,161
It's the only way
I can get him
to concentrate

737
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,036
on the matter at hand
and not on my feet.

738
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:37,836
You're prosecuting,
right?

739
00:30:37,943 --> 00:30:40,104
You know I am, Gina.
You've served me
with enough motions.

740
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:42,271
Right.
I've got a few more.

741
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:43,814
You saved me a trip.

742
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:46,177
I don't want
to wear out
these puppies.

743
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,116
Request for
a 7:30 hearing.

744
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:50,017
Psych eval.
Very original.

745
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:52,752
Thanks. IQ and physical

746
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,088
and neurological.

747
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:56,094
What, no proctologist?

748
00:30:56,163 --> 00:30:57,460
No, not this time.

749
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:01,266
Gina, you and I both know
any affirmative defense
you come up with

750
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:03,269
is going to be
a Ioad of crap.

751
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,066
BERNARDO: Dr. Shelton,

752
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:11,201
what exactly
does the brain's
frontal Iobe do?

753
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,240
It controls emotions, urges,

754
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:16,110
knowledge of
right and wrong.

755
00:31:16,183 --> 00:31:18,708
Basically, it's our
impulse control center.

756
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:20,646
So...

757
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:25,423
Say I had the urge to
call opposing counsel

758
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:27,890
an uptight,
self-righteous,
Iittle bitch,

759
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:32,388
my frontal Iobe knows
that means sanctions
and it keeps my mouth shut?

760
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:36,467
Yes. It imposes
appropriate inhibitions.

761
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:40,595
Did you conduct a series
of neurological tests
on Jerry Dupree?

762
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:41,800
I did.

763
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:44,466
Is...

764
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:47,246
Is there anything
wrong there?

765
00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:51,374
I found evidence of a recent
subdural hematoma right there.

766
00:31:51,885 --> 00:31:53,045
Here?
Yes.

767
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,746
It's a benign
mass of blood,

768
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,221
putting pressure
on his frontal Iobe.

769
00:31:57,424 --> 00:31:59,892
My God.
What does that mean?

770
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,550
Well, anyone who's
read my book knows

771
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,755
it can produce radical
personality changes.

772
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,390
I have well-documented
cases Iinking it

773
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,299
to violence and
a predisposition
to criminal behavior.

774
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,397
So, damaging
your frontal Iobe

775
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:15,202
is Iike somebody cutting
the brakes to your car.

776
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:17,368
There is no way
to stop yourself.

777
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:20,078
That's one way
of putting it.

778
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,509
Now, if you'II flip
to his PET scan.

779
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,743
Thank you.

780
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:29,017
The one on the top
is a normal
functioning brain.

781
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:31,621
The red indicates
increased brain metabolism,

782
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:33,626
a sign of high
brain activity.

783
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,953
BERNARDO: The one
on the bottom is Jerry's.

784
00:32:36,296 --> 00:32:37,763
Why is his so blue?

785
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:41,330
It illustrates decreased
frontal brain activity,

786
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:43,869
resulting from atrophy
due to his injury.

787
00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:45,894
So

788
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,767
would this explain
a previously meek,

789
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,903
gentle person
suddenly turning violent?

790
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:54,338
Absolutely.

791
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,449
It disinhibits and,
in extreme cases,

792
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,279
renders one
virtually incapable
of controlling one's urges.

793
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,453
Dr. Shelton, are you saying
that everyone who suffers

794
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,686
a blow to the frontal Iobe
will kill?

795
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,160
SHELTON: No, of course not.

796
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:11,690
There are numerous cases
in the history of brain...

797
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:12,789
CABOT: Thank you.

798
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,766
You've offered a very
provocative theory.

799
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:18,703
What it Iacks in substance
it makes up for
in pretty colors.

800
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:23,500
I've studied
the criminal brain
for the past 20 years.

801
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,837
The most vicious
were overwhelmingly

802
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:27,812
those with a combination
of abusive childhoods,

803
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,078
psychotic symptoms
and brain injuries.

804
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,946
How many people
participated in your study?

805
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:37,582
One hundred
and eighty-seven.

806
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:42,056
And how many people
suffer brain injuries
in a given year?

807
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:45,431
I don't have
the exact number.

808
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:47,694
The number is 500,000.

809
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:52,594
That's a half a million
predominately
Iaw-abiding citizens.

810
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:57,234
Pretty much dwarfs
your Iittle study,
wouldn't you say?

811
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:01,077
My study included
some of your most
infamous serial killers,

812
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:04,139
including Bundy,
Dahmer, Shawcross,

813
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:06,447
Mark David Chapman,
Joel Rifkin...

814
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,215
CABOT: And now Jerry Dupree.

815
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,914
Thank you, Doctor.
No further questions.

816
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:16,926
MRS. KRUG: He was
the best Iittle boy.

817
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:19,226
Never gave me
any trouble.

818
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,362
Even when his father died,

819
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,565
or when his
stepfather Ieft us,
he stayed sweet.

820
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:29,305
He never fought,
he never cursed.

821
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:32,204
Was there a time
when that changed?

822
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,572
In January.

823
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,574
What happened then?

824
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:37,207
My bakery was robbed.

825
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:40,680
A crazed man came in,
waving a hammer.

826
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:43,346
He told me that
he would kill me

827
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,448
if I didn't give him
all the money
in the register.

828
00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:48,426
Now, was Jerry
present at this time?

829
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,929
No, no. The man
started yelling,

830
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:55,223
and that's when
Jerry heard him
all the way upstairs.

831
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,766
BERNARDO:
And what did he do?

832
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:58,202
He came to my rescue.

833
00:34:58,738 --> 00:35:01,468
He tried to pull the weapon
from the man, but...

834
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:04,569
He got him,

835
00:35:05,912 --> 00:35:07,311
right in the head.

836
00:35:08,014 --> 00:35:09,641
Struck him in the head.

837
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:13,148
Your Honor, I'd Iike to
submit into evidence

838
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,211
Defense exhibits 21,

839
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:17,487
the police report
of the robbery,

840
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:20,754
and 22, hospital records
of Jerry's concussion.

841
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:22,292
CORWIN: So entered.

842
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:27,360
Now, how Iong after this
did you notice a change
in Jerry's personality?

843
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:31,268
Immediately. He had
headaches all the time.

844
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:35,773
He would burst
into fits of anger
at the Ieast Iittle thing.

845
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,037
And he started swearing.

846
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:40,808
And you are
absolutely positive

847
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,450
that this did not occur
until after the attack?

848
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:46,109
Yes.

849
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,685
My son is not the same person.
But that is not his fault.

850
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,687
The man who hurt him
should be on trial
for this murder,

851
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:55,252
not Jerry. He was...

852
00:35:56,665 --> 00:35:58,565
He was protecting
his mother.

853
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:03,161
She has them believing
Jerry's a hero.

854
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:05,035
Well, the robbery case
is still open.

855
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:08,167
No Ieads on the perp.
But the mother did
file a report that day.

856
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:10,234
Brain injury's
Iegitimate, too.

857
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:13,042
But not as an excuse.
Just Iook at our victim.

858
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:16,414
Kunsong endured
every abuse imaginable,
and she never hurt a soul.

859
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:17,952
It is a pretty
sick irony.

860
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,011
She survives hell
only to meet Jerry.

861
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:22,722
Who's apparently
a bit of a klutz.

862
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:24,315
CABOT: What do you mean?

863
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:28,227
Gina's expert concentrated
on the functional damage,
proving the injury,

864
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,697
but there's numerous
indications here
of structural damage.

865
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,757
Are you saying he's been
hit in the head before?

866
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,325
Repeatedly.
But not Iimited
to the frontal Iobe.

867
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,770
And from the Iooks
of some of these
healed Iesions,

868
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,636
over a Iong period of time.

869
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:42,368
It's funny, the mother
never mentioned these.

870
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:44,435
Probably because they weren't
from defending helpless women

871
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:45,502
and children.

872
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:47,740
Maybe the Iast one
wasn't, either.

873
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:51,147
Good mothers have been known
to make excuses for bad sons.

874
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,385
Find me evidence
she perjured herself.

875
00:36:57,492 --> 00:36:59,050
MUNCH: How badly
was Jerry hurt?

876
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:01,027
When we found him,
his pupils weren't reactive.

877
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,290
He couldn't answer
basic questions,

878
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:03,922
and he drifted
in and out of
consciousness.

879
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,466
I take it the mother
was hysterical.

880
00:37:05,534 --> 00:37:07,900
She insisted on riding along.
Wouldn't Ieave his side.

881
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,370
We had to physically
pull her away
just to check his vitals.

882
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,736
MUNCH: She tell you
what happened?

883
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:13,570
When we first got there,
the Iittle brother told us

884
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:15,610
he found him unconscious,
couldn't wake him up.

885
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:16,905
Wait a minute.
Where was the mother?

886
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:19,209
Downstairs in the bakery.

887
00:37:19,514 --> 00:37:20,981
MUNCH: Wasn't
Jerry down there?

888
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:23,483
No. We responded
to the residence upstairs.

889
00:37:23,552 --> 00:37:25,144
He was in his bedroom.

890
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:27,311
Why would my mom Iie?

891
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:28,651
To protect Jerry.

892
00:37:29,324 --> 00:37:31,383
We figure she had
to do that a Iot.

893
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,518
No.

894
00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:34,221
You know, if your mom's
making up stories,

895
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:35,695
or if she knows of
other women he's hurt,

896
00:37:35,764 --> 00:37:37,527
then she could go
to jail, too.

897
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,624
You don't want that,
now, do you?

898
00:37:41,503 --> 00:37:46,304
Brendan, we know your mom
wants to protect Jerry
because she Ioves him.

899
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,032
But he's already
ruined enough Iives.

900
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:51,602
Don't Iet him hurt your mom
any more than he already has.

901
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,581
You don't even know her.
She's the one who hurt him.

902
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,418
Your mom hit Jerry
that night?

903
00:37:58,186 --> 00:38:00,086
Yes.
STABLER: Why?

904
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:01,880
Same reason as always.

905
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:04,755
She caught him with
another pair of Iady's shoes.

906
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:08,958
First time she caught him,
he was five years old.

907
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:11,829
Has she been
hitting Jerry
ever since?

908
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:15,467
She blames Jerry
for our dad Ieaving us

909
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:17,129
since he was
such an embarrassment.

910
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:19,036
What did she hit him with
that night?

911
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:21,098
The Iady's shoe
she caught him with.

912
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:22,905
It had a big wooden heel.

913
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:26,078
Brendan, does your mom
ever hit you?

914
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:29,083
Sometimes. But I'm a Iot
quicker than Jerry.

915
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:31,243
She's definitely
gonna whale on me

916
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,550
when she finds out
I told you all this.

917
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:36,523
You Ieave my mother
out of this.

918
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:38,115
Afraid that we can't
do that, Jerry.

919
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:40,718
Not after the blow by blow
Brendan gave us.

920
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,463
Jerry, we can
plead you guilty
but not responsible,

921
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:45,159
but you have got
to work with us.

922
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:46,632
My mother
never hit me.

923
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,727
Why would your brother
say that?

924
00:38:49,638 --> 00:38:50,900
To protect me.

925
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:52,672
Like Dr. Sorenson,

926
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,299
who treated you when
your mother put you
in the hospital?

927
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,503
She didn't!

928
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,080
He told your mother
that your head injury
was severe.

929
00:39:01,149 --> 00:39:02,946
That you had
to be careful.

930
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,143
No.

931
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,619
BENSON: That with
any further trauma,

932
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:08,883
the consequences
could be devastating.

933
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:13,893
Jerry, did she hit you
again after that?

934
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,697
I killed that girl.

935
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,033
I belong in prison.

936
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:21,831
You belong in a hospital.

937
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:25,938
You heard the expert.
They can't fix me.

938
00:39:28,343 --> 00:39:30,106
If I get out,
I'II just do it again.

939
00:39:30,178 --> 00:39:31,440
BENSON: Like your mom?

940
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:35,080
Tell me what's gonna happen
when Brendan does something

941
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,139
to piss her off.

942
00:39:37,552 --> 00:39:38,814
JERRY: He won't.
No?

943
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:41,954
He's not Iike me.
He's normal.

944
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:47,558
Jerry, your mother's
used to taking out
her frustrations on somebody.

945
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,797
Now, who's that person
gonna be when you're
out of the house?

946
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:01,806
There was a girl
in the bakery.

947
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:04,937
I started talking
about her shoes.

948
00:40:07,182 --> 00:40:08,444
Right in front of Ma.

949
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:10,280
Okay. What happened?

950
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:16,580
She went crazy.
Came after me
with a frying pan.

951
00:40:20,328 --> 00:40:22,262
I told her,
"Not my head, Ma."

952
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,328
It just made her madder.

953
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,434
She caught me
on the side of my head,

954
00:40:31,106 --> 00:40:32,437
knocked me down,

955
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,138
kept hitting.

956
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:40,177
I begged her to stop.

957
00:40:41,082 --> 00:40:43,573
"Ma, please, remember
what the doctor said."

958
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:49,315
She grabbed the handle
with both hands,

959
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,024
brought it down
as hard as she could.

960
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,227
That's the Iast thing
that I remember.

961
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:12,604
Here you go.
Enjoy, huh?

962
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:15,149
Enjoy it to go.
The rest of you might want
to find another bakery.

963
00:41:15,217 --> 00:41:17,082
What are you doing?
PIacing you under arrest.

964
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:18,176
What for?

965
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:19,777
BENSON: The murder
of Kunsong Bennett.

966
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:22,517
Oh, that's insane.
I had nothing
to do with that.

967
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:23,615
Yeah, you did.

968
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:25,683
You caused the injuries that
turned Jerry into a killer.

969
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,921
What?
That's depraved indifference.

970
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:29,020
Murder two.

971
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:30,655
I didn't make him
the way that he is.

972
00:41:30,732 --> 00:41:32,131
There's always something
wrong with him.

973
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,895
I did everything
I could to fix it.

974
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,027
With blows to the head?

975
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:36,593
Nothing else worked!

976
00:41:37,072 --> 00:41:38,972
You don't know what
he put me through!

977
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,234
Oh, don't Iook at me
Iike that.

978
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:42,401
I am not the one
that's sick.

979
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:44,672
You know me.

980
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:46,244
You know that
I'm a good mother.

981
00:41:46,314 --> 00:41:48,282
You tell them that
I'm a good mother!

982
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,510
Tell them!
