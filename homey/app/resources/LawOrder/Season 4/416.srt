00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:00,962
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:05,267
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,932
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,943
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:13,310
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,309
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,146
We're good to go.

8
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,208
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,309
Damn it.

10
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,790
I got to take this.

11
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,292
Make a sound,
and I'II cut your balls off.

12
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,231
Hi, sweetie.
What's wrong?

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,595
What the hell?

14
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,735
Mommy will be home soon.

15
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,863
Wake the sitter and have her
give you some cough medicine.

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,964
Mmm-hmm.
Where does it hurt?

17
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,335
Hey, can I get
my money back?

18
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,241
Oh, no. Your tummy
hurts you, too?

19
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,403
Screw you.

20
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,446
I'II be home...
I can find a hotter
piece of ass

21
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,210
with a Iot Iess baggage.

22
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,807
(CLATTERING)

23
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,815
Oh, my God.

24
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:58,555
My partner and I were
patrolling a block away
when we heard screaming.

25
00:00:58,626 --> 00:00:59,615
You heard the attack?

26
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,320
No, no. The discovery.

27
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,295
Tough guy in the parka.

28
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:05,056
I didn't see anything.

29
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,394
STABLER: Sexually posed,
put on display.

30
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,437
Our boy wants to read
about this in the paper.

31
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,495
Ligature marks
around the neck.

32
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,469
No other apparent wounds.

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,433
Except for the skirt.

34
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,608
Wasn't short enough
for somebody.
It's been cut off.

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,978
We got blood on the boot.
Maybe she got a piece of him.

36
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,778
BENSON: I'II grab
an evidence bag.

37
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,121
Liv. I don't think
the blood's our perp's.

38
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,683
It's hers.

39
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,728
Guys, anyone find
a severed foot?

40
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,742
Stump's pretty
chewed up.

41
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,842
Sawed off,
as opposed to
one good hack.

42
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,079
Perp used a saw?

43
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,714
BIade wasn't that thick,
but it was serrated.

44
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,950
Based on the hesitation marks,
I'd say two millimeter width.

45
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,823
It's your garden-variety
kitchen knife.

46
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,295
Probably upper-end.
See the impression here?

47
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,661
It's from the hilt guard.

48
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,063
Only your better
knives have them.

49
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,124
He chop her pre
or post-mortem?

50
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,136
No bruising, minimal clotting,
so she was already dead

51
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,264
as a result of
Iigature strangulation.

52
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,570
Yeah, now that Iooks too thin
to be a belt or a rope.

53
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,702
WARNER: Wire. He thoughtfully
used enough force

54
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,507
to show me that
it was braided.

55
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,512
Ten threads,
12 or 14 gauge.

56
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,880
Can you be a Iittle bit
more specific?

57
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:08,045
It Ieft no visible residue,
but if we get a reaction
with rubionic acid...

58
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,315
WARNER: It was copper.

59
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,155
Well, she was found
in the red Iight district.

60
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,821
If she was on the stroll,
we've probably got her prints.

61
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,090
No hits.

62
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,191
AIso, no STDs
or cervical dysplasia.

63
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,632
She probably
wasn't a pro.

64
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,102
So, all we have is
Asian, mid-twenties.

65
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,128
With a painful past.

66
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,175
I found healed burn marks
on the genitals.

67
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,571
We've seen that
before. Cigarettes?

68
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,838
More conducive with
an electro-shock device.

69
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,313
And then there's this.

70
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,216
See the nine metacarpal bones,
making up the wrist?

71
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,953
Hers are disrupted.

72
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,257
She also has old tears
to her rotator cuffs.

73
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,189
She was hung by her wrists.

74
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,756
And tortured.

75
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,758
CRAGEN: Are we thinking
the guy who tortured her
in the past

76
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,026
finished the job Iast night?

77
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,567
Well, those scars are
a couple of years old.

78
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,569
That's a pretty big gap
between the attacks.

79
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,696
Assuming the first go-around
was an attack.

80
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,740
They sure as hell
weren't self-inflicted.

81
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,708
Nothing with
Missing Persons yet.

82
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,576
Restraints, painful game
of shock the kitty.
Smacks of S&M to me.

83
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,739
I know one woman's pain
can be another man's pleasure,

84
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,681
but this girl was not
spanked to death.

85
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,911
Say she hooks up
with a guy.

86
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,351
She's down with
the whips and chains,

87
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,786
but she bolts when he
revs up the cattle prod.

88
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,882
I don't know. George,
bondage/discipline
track for you?

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,551
These old scars
are political torture.

90
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:21,959
STABLER:
Where do you get that?

91
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,692
They're trademark techniques
used by the Chinese military
occupying Tibet.

92
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,926
I'd say she was Tibetan.

93
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,168
Meaning that she had
the audacity to support

94
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,033
the Dalai Lama
or an independent Tibet.

95
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,232
Maybe she was a nun.
I understand they're
a favorite target.

96
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,797
Right, Agent Huang?

97
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,874
According to Physicians
for Human Rights,
of which I'm a member.

98
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,675
CRAGEN: Maybe cutting off
the foot was a message.

99
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,773
Could a torturer have
followed her here?

100
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,839
Anything's possible.

101
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,715
AII right, then maybe
she came seeking
political asylum.

102
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,254
Check with the INS.

103
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,755
JOHNSON: Do you have any idea
how many immigrants
we get a year?

104
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,690
We're really only
interested in one.

105
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,924
A million,
10% of whom claim to be
political refugees.

106
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,999
But then there's
the million and a half
who try to sneak in illegally.

107
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,331
Gee, it's almost Iike
someone hung out a sign,
welcoming

108
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,394
your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses,
and then they...

109
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,870
Hey, we got a hit.

110
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,903
FIN: Kunsong Tashi.
Huang was right.

111
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,343
Birthplace, Tibet.

112
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,937
Was she granted
political asylum?

113
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,380
Never applied.
She got in on
a marriage visa.

114
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,476
So there's a husband
in the picture.
What's his name?

115
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,087
Preston Bennett.

116
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,716
BENSON: How did
you two meet?

117
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:31,495
(SNIFFLES) At the bazaar
at Dharamsala.

118
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,195
I found a 10th century
stone Vishnu,

119
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,998
but the merchant
spoke no English.

120
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,365
Kunsong was walking by,
and she interpreted for us.

121
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:46,339
And your relationship now
was still strong?

122
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,377
We never fought,
not once.

123
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,048
Mr. Bennett,
I got to tell you,
I find it awfully odd

124
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,281
that you didn't
report her missing.

125
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,913
I assumed she was
at the Center.

126
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,515
BENSON:
Which center is that?

127
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,153
It's a program at Bellevue
for torture survivors.

128
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,594
She was tortured
in Tibet?

129
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,935
Yes. For attending
a demonstration.

130
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:13,095
The police came,
rounded everyone up.

131
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,367
They kept her a month.

132
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,573
This center
that you mentioned,

133
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,577
was she having trouble
with anybody there?

134
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,306
No, it was a godsend.

135
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,577
We found it when
she first got here.

136
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,379
It helped her so much,
now she volunteers there.

137
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,818
Was she in the habit of
staying there all night?

138
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,219
She was there
constantly.

139
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,622
She had group therapy,
she interpreted.

140
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:36,322
And whenever a new survivor
entered the program,
she'd sit with them.

141
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,489
AII night?

142
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,620
Sometimes.

143
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,030
Without calling?

144
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,726
Yes.

145
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,430
I'm not buying it.

146
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,701
Kathy didn't come home
all night,

147
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,969
I'd be out
Iooking for her.

148
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,304
That's you.
That's everybody.

149
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,401
That's bull.

150
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,412
How many times have
we been working on a case

151
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,606
and Kathy doesn't
hear from you?

152
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,875
That's different.
I'm on the job.

153
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,213
Well, according
to her husband,
so was Kunsong.

154
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,856
She'd spend hours Iistening
to victims' horror stories,

155
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,291
even though
it usually meant

156
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,953
opening up
old wounds
of her own.

157
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,360
We saw the scars.

158
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,358
(SIGHS) They don't begin
to tell the story.

159
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,425
In prison, she was
stripped naked,

160
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,702
held in a small cage
for days without food,
and beaten around the clock.

161
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,900
As if the taser
to the genitals
wasn't enough.

162
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,307
EIectro-shock batons
are a favorite.

163
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,475
Not only is
the pain unbearable,

164
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,242
they don't Ieave
physical scars.

165
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,304
They did on Kunsong.

166
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,216
Only because the guard
raping her got careless

167
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,446
and exceeded
the mandated voltage.

168
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,285
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

169
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,059
Our Tibetan support group
is about to start.

170
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,891
They wanted to
have a memorial.

171
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,664
This was Kunsong's group?

172
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,222
Yes.
They consider her family.

173
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,731
She made this for them.

174
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,005
Group meet yesterday?

175
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,669
No. But she was here
in the afternoon,

176
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,269
helping to translate
affidavits for asylum.

177
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,478
She Ieft around 5:00.
BENSON: AIone?

178
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,541
Yes. I wish I had asked
her where she was going.

179
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,780
What do you know
about her husband?

180
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,956
There was no marital discord.

181
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,250
Really?

182
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,160
It's hard to believe that
somebody who went through

183
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:20,257
what Kunsong did
would have an easy time
in a relationship.

184
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,569
Preston cared
about her deeply.

185
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,935
If anything, he was
overly protective.

186
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,337
Who did Kunsong
need protection from?

187
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,702
Attention, everyone.

188
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,972
We'II be starting in
just a minute, okay?

189
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,478
Who did Kunsong
need protection from?

190
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,809
You have to understand,

191
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,946
the purpose of torture
is to break a person's will

192
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,886
and destroy their humanity.

193
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,988
Some degree of paranoia
is not uncommon.

194
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,493
Well, seeing how
Kunsong died,

195
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,621
maybe her fears
weren't all in her head.

196
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,858
Nearly half a million
survivors of torture

197
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,798
have relocated to the U.S.

198
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,668
There's no telling how many
of their tormentors
have followed suit.

199
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,434
Did she mention
any run-ins?

200
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,476
No, but she had become
more of an activist recently.

201
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,602
STABLER: How so?

202
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,306
A fellow survivor from group,
Detchen Gyatso,

203
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,506
took her to her first protest
just Iast week.

204
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,880
Is Detchen here?

205
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,215
No, but I know where
you can find her.

206
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,276
DETCHEN: Freedom for Tibet!

207
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,582
MUNCH: I'd say
she's our organizer.

208
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,055
Freedom for Tibet!

209
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,557
Freedom for Tibet!

210
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,616
Freedom for...
Detchen Gyatso?

211
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,456
We have a right
to be here.

212
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,587
We're not blocking traffic

213
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,098
and we're not obstructing
China's corrupt,
oppressive regime.

214
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,997
MUNCH: Hey, hey,
more power to you.

215
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,559
What do you want?

216
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,035
Want to talk to you
about Kunsong.

217
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,197
I understand she started
fighting the good fight
just Iast week.

218
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,036
Was it right out here
in front of the consulate?

219
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,837
No, a brokerage firm.

220
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,274
Myer Miller's.

221
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,836
A new stock offering
is funding a pipeline
through Tibet.

222
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,142
But we are hurting them.

223
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:46,117
The parent company has already
reduced their U.S. sale
from seven to five billion.

224
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,279
I've seen men killed
for a pizza.

225
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,422
Billions at stake?
That's motive for murder.

226
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,481
Anybody roughed up
at Iast week's soiree?

227
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,857
We're talking Times Square,
not Tiananmen.

228
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,623
Not even an idle threat?

229
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,598
Jerks didn't even
call the cops.
No arrests, no ink.

230
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,825
Only person taken away
all day was Kunsong.

231
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:02,891
MUNCH: By whom?

232
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,301
Her husband.

233
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,004
He showed up,
pulled her out of Iine.

234
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,337
He was yelling,
she was crying.

235
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,106
She didn't get to
finish the protest.

236
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,570
As I recall, the husband
stated they'd never fight.

237
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,741
Wonder what his
Iittle demonstration
was all about.

238
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,216
DETCHEN: Freedom for Tibet!

239
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:19,913
Freedom for...

240
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,042
Well?

241
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,554
It wasn't a fight.

242
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,783
You dragged your wife away
in tears in front of
a hundred witnesses.

243
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,224
A week before her murder.

244
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,455
You don't understand.
Oh, we understand
that you Iied to us.

245
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,655
I was just trying
to protect her.

246
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,097
Yeah? From what?
Facing her fears,
or moving on?

247
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,191
The more independent she grew,
the Iess control you had?

248
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,360
It was too soon.

249
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,460
To get on with her Iife?

250
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,438
We were at the end of our
three-year probation period
with the INS.

251
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:44,273
If she had been arrested,
she could have been
deported back to hell.

252
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,605
Dug up something
on your boy here.

253
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,741
Turns out he has
a history with us.

254
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,109
What? I've never been
arrested in my Iife.

255
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,951
No. But a patrol car
responded to a 911 call
at your residence.

256
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,719
What was that?
Another fight you never had?

257
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,121
A neighbor misinterpreted
something he heard.

258
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,688
Kunsong screaming
bloody murder
in the middle of the night.

259
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,325
On a regular basis.

260
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,833
How's that open
to interpretation?

261
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,632
She had nightmares!

262
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,430
She tried everything,
even sleeping upright
in a chair.

263
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,609
Still, she'd wake up
thinking she was
back in Tibet.

264
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,737
The nightmares were so real,

265
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,407
even with me holding her,
she couldn't stop screaming.

266
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,211
Well, someone shut her up.

267
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,814
With a wire across
her vocal chords.

268
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,383
I'm a Buddhist,
for God's sake.

269
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,981
I could never take a Iife.

270
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,356
That's funny.
I talked to the neighbor
that reported you.

271
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,293
I guess you forgot
your pacifist crap

272
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,490
when you threatened him
the next day.

273
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,395
Do you have any idea
how much trauma he caused her?

274
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,798
BENSON: By calling the police?

275
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,098
Two men in uniform, showing up
in the middle of the night,

276
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,571
that's how nightmares begin
where she's from.

277
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,235
And unless this is
a police state, too,
I assume I'm free to Ieave.

278
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,815
He's Iying.

279
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,449
STABLER: Husband
is a broken record.

280
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,920
Every problem we find
in their marriage,

281
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,219
he explains away with
his wife's horrible past.

282
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,385
He may Iie,
but paper trails don't.

283
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,725
He take out
an insurance policy
on Kunsong?

284
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,229
There's nothing.
As far as I can tell,

285
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,027
he's not making a penny
from her death.

286
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,863
How we doing on
shaking his alibi?

287
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,699
CIaims he was home alone.
I haven't found a soul
to confirm that.

288
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,102
You pull his LUDs?

289
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,037
Night of the murder,
not a single call.

290
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,302
Of course not.
He wasn't there.

291
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,740
Well, it doesn't
prove he wasn't.

292
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,801
Well, this does.
I pulled Preston's
financials.

293
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,074
There's a charge
on his corporate card
at 6:00 that night.

294
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,173
CRAGEN: Where?
A place called Hello Dalai.

295
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,241
What is that?
BENSON: I've been there.

296
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,420
It's a Iittle
Tibetan restaurant
in the Village.

297
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,624
FIN: You recognize
Mr. Bennett?

298
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,684
Sure. He and his wife
are regulars.

299
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:42,990
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

300
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,826
He hasn't been here
in a couple of weeks.

301
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,560
According to his
credit card company,
he was here Iast Tuesday.

302
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,864
You've got it backwards.
His wife was, he wasn't.

303
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,096
You sure about that?

304
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,469
Positive. It was before
the dinner rush.

305
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,700
They were the only ones
in here.

306
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:55,901
They?

307
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,601
She was with a gentleman.
MUNCH: Describe him.

308
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,111
Brown hair, thirtyish.

309
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,205
Scars, tattoos,
anything unusual?

310
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,940
Perfect tan in February
kind of stood out.
That and his hefty tip.

311
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,782
Wait a minute. That was
her husband's card,

312
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,685
so she would've had
to sign for the meal.

313
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,314
No, I'm sure he signed.

314
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,188
FIN: Think you still
got that receipt?

315
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,318
I'II check.

316
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,593
Husband's definitely
got motive now.

317
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,789
Not only was she
cheating on him,

318
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,923
she was using his money
to wine and dine her Iover.

319
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,365
Guy's sure got
a set on him.

320
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,834
Signing the husband's card?
That's cold.

321
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,701
I'm the manager.
Is there a problem?

322
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,740
Well, for starters,
a case of identity theft.

323
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,936
Someone other than
Mr. Bennett signed
a receipt Tuesday night.

324
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,308
You mean Mr. Chambers.

325
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,313
He's an authorized signer
on that card.

326
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,609
Who the hell's Mr. Chambers?

327
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,206
Mr. Bennett's partner.

328
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,252
He's the "C"
in B & C Importers.

329
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,877
Mr. Bennett's
business partner.

330
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,684
The triangle thickens.

331
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,889
STABLER: Ryan Chambers?
Yes.

332
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,019
BENSON: Like to talk to you
about Kunsong Bennett.

333
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,528
Do you mind
if we come in?

334
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,655
This really isn't
a good time.

335
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,426
STABLER: Well, you know,
for us, either.

336
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,435
We would've preferred
to talk to you the day
her body was discovered.

337
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,269
But at the time,
we hadn't yet heard about
your torrid Iittle affair.

338
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,066
What are you talking about?

339
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,973
STABLER: Preston know
you were banging his wife?

340
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,774
(SCOFFS) I doubt it,
since I wasn't.

341
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,380
You got a sense of humor.
That's good.

342
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,848
That'II serve you well
in prison.

343
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,542
What?

344
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,814
You were the Iast person
who saw her alive.

345
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,185
You're going to need
to come with us.

346
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,417
PRESTON:
That won't be necessary.

347
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,329
So the marriage was a sham.

348
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,600
Did Kunsong know?

349
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,261
Of course she did.

350
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,272
But we really did
care for each other.

351
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,102
That's why I married her.
It was the only way
to bring her here.

352
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,268
STABLER: You cared so much,

353
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,279
why have you been obstructing
her murder investigation?

354
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,473
I panicked.

355
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,176
You have to understand.
I violated federal
immigration Iaws.

356
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,718
The INS could
put him in prison.

357
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,343
Not to mention
take away our business.

358
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,910
You don't want us
to fill them in,

359
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,184
then I suggest you tell us
what happened that night.

360
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:54,625
If I had any information
about her killer,
I would have told you.

361
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,389
What happened at dinner?

362
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,863
Nothing.
We had a quick bite,

363
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,593
went our separate ways.
I came home and Preston
was already here.

364
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,260
It was a bury-the-hatchet
dinner.

365
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,167
You and Kunsong
had problems?

366
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,297
She was very sweet,
but it was going on
three years.

367
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,932
It was putting a strain
on our relationship.

368
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,442
Which she sensed.

369
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,644
That's why she moved out.

370
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,736
She what?

371
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,212
We put the apartment
in my name,

372
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,182
so the INS
wouldn't find out.

373
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,250
BENSON: How's it going, guys?

374
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,016
No sign of blood.

375
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,550
No sign of a struggle.

376
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,627
Not much to disturb.

377
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,731
Free Tibet. She was
disturbing someone.

378
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,756
BENSON: Got a notepad.
Yeah?

379
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,596
Nothing. Just a grocery Iist.

380
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:36,658
Bag it.

381
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,536
ANSWERING MACHINE:
You have no messages.

382
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,808
Guess she wasn't
real popular.
CIassifieds.

383
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,104
She was Iooking
to buy used furniture.

384
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,544
She needed it.

385
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,844
She had two stars
by a floral,
shabby-chic couch.

386
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,053
She was going
to see this one.

387
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,486
The day she died.

388
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,394
She called. I told her
to come by after 6:00.

389
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,454
I was here all night,
she never showed.

390
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:06,090
She was having dinner
four blocks from here.

391
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,725
It would've been
right on her way.

392
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,235
I don't know
what to tell you.

393
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,430
This is not the couch
in your ad.

394
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,173
I sold it.
To whom?

395
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:17,039
Some sorority chick.
I don't know, Buffy,
Cindy, something Iike that.

396
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:18,135
She paid cash.

397
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,736
Mostly women
answer your ad?

398
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:20,872
Yeah.

399
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:24,081
You don't strike me
as a floral, shabby-chic
kind of guy.

400
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,552
I'm not.
That's why I sold it.
It belonged to my ex.

401
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:29,418
Now, why would she
Ieave a catch Iike you?

402
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,516
'Cause she's a whore.
And she found a fatter wallet.

403
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:33,855
That knife collection hers?

404
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:36,396
That worthless bitch
couldn't boil water.

405
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:39,529
Those are mine.

406
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,225
It's a perfect scam.

407
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:44,503
I mean, how many other ways
do you get women

408
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:47,473
to walk voluntarily into
a complete stranger's home?

409
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:51,039
Big bang for the buck.
CIassifieds are,
what, $5 a Iine?

410
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:53,012
Do we even know
this couch existed?

411
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,809
We're trying to
track down the ex.

412
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:56,110
What do we have
on this guy?

413
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,879
Paulie Obregano.
Two drunk and disorderlies,
but that was awhile ago.

414
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:00,079
Well, if he's
a mean drunk,

415
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:02,145
his wife Ieaving
would give him
an ax to grind.

416
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:03,884
(PHONE RINGING)
Against a pretty
Iittle ankle bone.

417
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,823
Yeah, he had
the carving knives
to do it.

418
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:06,917
Benson, SVU.

419
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,154
It's all circumstantial.

420
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:10,527
We're gonna need
a Iot more than that
to get a search warrant.

421
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:13,863
That was the Iab.
They already have
something on the boots.

422
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:17,095
What've we got?
DNA? Prints?

423
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:19,669
No. But something's
definitely afoot.

424
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:21,833
These are a size nine.

425
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,542
I checked to make sure
it wasn't mismarked.

426
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,600
STABLER: Why?

427
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:26,976
Well, the victim's foot
measured nine and
three sixteenths inches.

428
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,539
That would make her
a size six and a half.

429
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,809
She was wearing shoes
two and a half sizes too big?

430
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:34,753
Hold on, these are
Jacques Le Corre.
These are $700 boots.

431
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,312
I mean, maybe
they were on sale, but...

432
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,914
Wouldn't that be
really uncomfortable?

433
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:41,120
Only if she bought
these boots for walking,
which she never did.

434
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:42,492
BENSON: They've got
wear marks right here.

435
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:43,723
TREVOR: Not where
they should be.

436
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:44,890
These roll to the outside.

437
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,934
According to
the autopsy report,
she was pigeon-toed.

438
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,930
These weren't her boots.

439
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:56,032
Some Prince Charming
slipped one of your shoes
on our victim.

440
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,805
Is there any kind
of hidden Iot number

441
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,436
that could tell us where
that shoe was purchased?

442
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,605
Sorry, no.

443
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:03,215
Surely you must have
some way of tracking
your inventory.

444
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:04,945
That would be
on the shoebox.

445
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,646
Well, how many stores
are we talking about?

446
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,188
We're only carried
by the most exclusive.

447
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,226
Of course, given their
multiple chain Iocations
in the tri-state area,

448
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:14,659
about a thousand.

449
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,420
Every store carry
every design?

450
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:19,591
Every buyer carries
shoes that appeal to
their store's demographics.

451
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,157
Who stocks this one?

452
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,827
No one.

453
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:26,131
It's a prototype.
It's not due to hit shelves
for another month.

454
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:27,333
Who had access to it?

455
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:29,342
Laurie Schneider
reps that account.

456
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,207
Could you point us her way?

457
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:32,534
And go.

458
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:35,340
Okay, that's my Iast
model for this run.
I've got two minutes.

459
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,247
What can I tell you
about the Bellanobla model?

460
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,548
You know about a pair
walking off by themselves?

461
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,712
Size nine.

462
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:43,022
Crystal's our only
model that size.

463
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,853
She wore them
in a show Iast month.

464
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,517
Models get to keep
everything else in Iife.

465
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,084
They get to keep
the shoes, too?

466
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:49,493
They're not
supposed to, but...

467
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,552
Where can we find her?

468
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,655
LAURIE: Milan.

469
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,859
How can we contact her there?

470
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:56,330
Is that really necessary?

471
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,270
Did we mention that this is
a murder investigation?

472
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,769
Okay, she didn't
take them, I did.

473
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:04,276
For what I thought
was a hot date.

474
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:05,937
What, he knock
your boots off?

475
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:08,811
Trust me, this Ioser
didn't touch
anything of mine.

476
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,043
You know where he took me?

477
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,982
The Rock 'n' Roll Bowl.
MUNCH: Very trendy.

478
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:13,542
It's a bowling alley.

479
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,714
And just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse,

480
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,051
my boots disappeared.

481
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,250
Somebody jacked the boots?

482
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,520
Yes. It was
20 degrees outside.

483
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,893
I had to ride home
in my stocking feet.

484
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,453
At Ieast you got to keep
both of yours.

485
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,830
The next woman
wasn't so Iucky.

486
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,729
Yeah, I remember her.
She was really unhappy
with her date.

487
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,362
Totally hitting on me.

488
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,873
Really? Now, was that here
at the counter, or did she

489
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,000
Iure you down
to her Iane?

490
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:38,169
No, no. I was working
concessions that night.

491
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:40,008
I delivered several
pitchers of beer
to the Iady.

492
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,911
STABLER: How often do shoes
get stolen from here?

493
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:44,849
Hey, Jerry, we got
a pin stuck on Iane 17.
You wanna get on that?

494
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,547
BENSON: Hey, Marshall,
you didn't answer
the question.

495
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:49,715
Lots of shoes go missing
on your watch?

496
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,554
Well, no, they don't go
missing that often. But...

497
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,094
I mean, we get kids
playing pranks and stuff.

498
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,790
But between you and me,
I mean, that Iady
was so toasted

499
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,333
she probably dropped them
down the ball return.

500
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,198
Hey, buddy, buddy,

501
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,268
what's it Iike working
for Marshall the Kingpin?

502
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,772
I hate that guy.

503
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,068
You hate him?

504
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,872
He annoy the customers
as much as he annoys you?

505
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:14,476
Yeah, he hits on every girl
that walks through that door.
It's pathetic.

506
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,776
Oh, really?

507
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:18,547
I'm guessing he sees
a Iot of rejection.

508
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,780
Nothing but.
He never gets anywhere.

509
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:23,515
Well, aside from
this bad habit

510
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,525
of harassing women,
you ever see him

511
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,788
taking things that
don't belong to him?

512
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,195
I wouldn't put it past him.

513
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,265
STABLER: Yeah, go ahead.

514
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:39,231
Okay, any record of
bowling-alley guy
crossing the foul Iine?

515
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,364
He's clean.

516
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:42,136
He's young.
Maybe he hasn't
been caught yet.

517
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:43,972
Or maybe he hasn't
been reported yet.

518
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,477
I mean, who's going to
go to all the trouble

519
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,514
of reporting a pair
of stolen shoes?

520
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,981
You'd be surprised.
I pulled 61s on all crimes

521
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,041
where shoes came into play
in any way.

522
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,053
What, every pin
is a stolen shoe?

523
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,486
Not necessarily.

524
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,854
MUNCH: AII the red pins
represent the robberies
and the B and E's.

525
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,723
It doesn't make sense.
I mean, why break in
and just take shoes?

526
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,728
Because you got
a shoe fetish.

527
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:04,487
It's a sexual philia where

528
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:08,365
arousal is triggered by shoes,
feet, or even smelly socks.

529
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:09,795
That's one
I've never gotten.

530
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,303
HUANG: There are
plenty of theories.

531
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:12,361
It could just be
cross-wiring.

532
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,963
In the control map
of the brain,

533
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,406
the genitals are
right next to the feet.

534
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:19,105
More importantly,
are any of these break-ins
near the bowling alley?

535
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:22,410
The Rock 'n' Roll Bowl is here
in one of the Ieast hit areas.

536
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:24,451
He have any connection
to the Village?

537
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:26,076
'Cause that's our
heaviest concentration.

538
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,713
No. But Paulie,
the couch guy, does.

539
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,279
He Iives at

540
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,691
462 East Houston.

541
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:35,887
That's dead in the middle.

542
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,487
CRAGEN: What's the green pin?

543
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,530
MUNCH: Physical assault.
HUANG: Really?

544
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:42,392
Shoe fetishism isn't
usually a violent paraphilia.

545
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,835
An NYU graduate student,
Greta Thorsen,

546
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:47,533
two weeks ago, was choked
into unconsciousness.

547
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,042
And when she woke up,
her shoes were gone.

548
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,237
CRAGEN: She give
a description?
Couldn't.

549
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:55,743
Pull Paulie's
driver's Iicense photo.
Throw it into a photo array,

550
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,511
see if it jogs a memory.

551
00:21:58,652 --> 00:21:59,983
GRETA: I don't know
what else I can tell you.

552
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:01,783
But I'm going to be
Iate for class.

553
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,755
Those are nice
running shoes.

554
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:07,516
I'm 5'1", but no one knew
I was short because
I used to Iive in heels.

555
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,061
Now I'm afraid to wear them.

556
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:10,460
Is that since
the attack?

557
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:12,965
That bastard took
three inches off my Iife.

558
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,364
I'm not even
the same person.

559
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:16,960
I promise, helping us
is going to help you.

560
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:19,130
Now, tell us
everything you know.

561
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,430
It was dark.

562
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,203
I didn't see anyone around.
I was almost to my dorm.

563
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,507
AII of a sudden
there were hands
around my throat.

564
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,513
Do you recognize
any of these men?

565
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:30,880
I told you, he came up
from behind me.
I never saw his face.

566
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,151
Did he press up against you?

567
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,245
I tried to pull away.
He jerked me back.

568
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:37,017
My head hit his chin.

569
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,385
You're 5'4" with heels.
That would make him between

570
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:42,156
5'8" and 5'10".

571
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:43,728
STABLER: Can you walk us
through that day?

572
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,025
I was in classes
all day Iong

573
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,532
with about a million
other students.

574
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,828
Did you go off campus?

575
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,562
Just to the bakery
at Houston and Sullivan.

576
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:52,127
I was on my way
back from there
when it happened.

577
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,332
I got to go.

578
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:56,635
Paulie Iives on Houston.

579
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,938
Two blocks away.

580
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:03,741
MRS. KRUG: Greta
hasn't been in,
in a few weeks.

581
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,342
But she used to
come in at night
to stock up on muffins.

582
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,012
She hates
that dorm food.

583
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:10,454
Do you know this much
about all of your customers?

584
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:12,617
It's a real
neighborhood bakery.

585
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,388
I know just about everybody
in a ten-block radius.

586
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:18,090
By order, mind you,
not necessarily by name.

587
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,430
BENSON: This girl's name
is Kunsong.

588
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:25,496
No.

589
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,669
No, I don't think
she's been in here.

590
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,606
How many employees
do you have working here?

591
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:32,839
Just Michael and Rodney.
But they're good guys.

592
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,642
And who's this?
MRS. KRUG: Brendan.

593
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:38,409
No. You'II ruin
your appetite.
He's my boy.

594
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:41,584
Any of these men customers?

595
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,852
(SIGHS)

596
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:47,315
This one.

597
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,620
That's pumpernickel
and olive Ioaf.

598
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:50,958
You've got your mom's
good memory.

599
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:52,726
Do either one of you remember

600
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,893
if he came in here
on the night of January 15th?

601
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:58,904
Two weeks ago? Well, no,
that I can't tell you.

602
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:00,769
But he is a regular.

603
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:08,405
Seriously, how Iong you
gonna keep jamming me up here?

604
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:11,448
BENSON: I don't know, Paulie.
That's up to you.

605
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,184
How would it help?

606
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,051
Louder or slower?
I didn't do anything.

607
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:23,457
We've got a murdered girl.

608
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,896
Our medical examiner
places her time of death

609
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,593
smack dab in the period

610
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,460
she was scheduled
to be in your apartment.

611
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:30,594
Coincidence.

612
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,366
We've got another girl,
attacked two weeks ago

613
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:34,236
after Ieaving one of
your favorite haunts.

614
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,004
Where?
Bakery, two blocks
from your apartment.

615
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:38,601
You know how many
people go in there?

616
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,078
That place is
always crammed.

617
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,444
Well, we also have a slew

618
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:44,006
of very peculiar burglaries
in your neighborhood.

619
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:45,278
This is unbelievable.

620
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:47,752
My thieving
whore of an ex
robs me blind,

621
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,584
and you accuse me
of stealing?

622
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,693
What do I gotta do
to prove to you

623
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,956
I've got nothing
to do with this?

624
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:57,993
Let us search
your apartment.

625
00:24:58,066 --> 00:24:59,158
Fine.

626
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:04,896
BENSON: So what did we get?

627
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,840
Nothing indicating
Kunsong ever set foot
in Paulie's apartment.

628
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,604
We dusted floor to ceiling,
vacuumed the carpet.

629
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:11,372
Not a matching print,
hair or fiber.

630
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:12,435
What about
the knives?

631
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:14,209
No blood. There,
or in any of his drains.

632
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:15,715
Well, they told us
that you found something.

633
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:17,182
In her apartment,
not his.

634
00:25:17,252 --> 00:25:18,583
Detectives,
remember the notepad

635
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:20,086
you picked up
by the victim's phone?

636
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:21,485
The one with
the grocery Iist
on it, yeah.

637
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:23,285
You find something
else there?
Nothing yet.

638
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:25,724
But the EIectrostatic
Detection Apparatus
can recover indented

639
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:28,057
writing three,
even four pages,
beneath the original.

640
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:30,654
Now, we vacuum Iock it
to the plate

641
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:33,928
and subject it
to a high-voltage
static charge.

642
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:36,997
Giving us a variably
charged surface

643
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:40,302
with the heavier static charge
remaining in any impressions,

644
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,776
which will attract this toner.

645
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:48,280
Which should give us
a carbon copy of the original.

646
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:49,540
CARLISLE: Yep.

647
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,816
Just Iike this.

648
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:56,350
Does "Couch, 642 East Houston,
apartment 2A,

649
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,449
"after 6:00" mean
anything to you?

650
00:25:58,693 --> 00:25:59,955
Damn it, that's
Paulie's home address.

651
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,655
No, it isn't.

652
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,920
His is 462.

653
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,862
She inverted the numbers.

654
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,560
STABLER: Well,
who the hell Iives there?

655
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,706
It's right next door
to the bakery.

656
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:14,332
It's Ieading to
the apartment upstairs.

657
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:15,774
Hey, Detectives.

658
00:26:15,977 --> 00:26:17,945
You're just in time
for fresh banana bread.

659
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:19,377
That sounds great.

660
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:22,143
Listen, can you tell us
who Iives above the bakery?

661
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:23,205
I do.

662
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:27,787
Well, you didn't
recognize her
as a customer.

663
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:31,649
Maybe she came by that day
Iooking for used furniture?

664
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:35,326
Well, I don't know
why she would.
I wasn't selling any.

665
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:37,125
Well, is there
a Mr. Krug?

666
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,691
Somewhere.

667
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,861
So it's just you
and your son Brendan?

668
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:43,460
And his half-brother.

669
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:46,365
My son from my
first marriage. Jerry.

670
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:50,440
Hey, Jerry,
come out here, please.

671
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:52,501
What, Ma?

672
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,449
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Jerry.

673
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:04,423
We did a very
thorough search
of your room.

674
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:05,516
We found
your secret stash.

675
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:07,117
You had no right
to touch my things.

676
00:27:07,195 --> 00:27:08,594
Your things?
These aren't your things.

677
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:09,721
We've already
tied half of them

678
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,094
to burglaries in
your neighborhood.

679
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:12,655
We talked
to your mom.

680
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:16,670
She said that she found you
wearing a pair Iike this
when you were five.

681
00:27:18,006 --> 00:27:19,234
I'm not gay.

682
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:22,135
I just Iike the way
that they Iook.

683
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:25,775
On women.
So I collect them.
It's harmless.

684
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:27,209
It's harmless?

685
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,215
What happened to
the college student
who was wearing these?

686
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:34,544
You nearly
choked her to death.

687
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,484
I don't know.

688
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:39,518
BENSON: You followed her
from the bakery.

689
00:27:39,694 --> 00:27:41,958
Just to see where she Iived,

690
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,327
so that I could go
get them Iater.

691
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:47,796
Look, I swear, I swear,

692
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:51,033
this is the first time
that I ever hurt anybody.

693
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,264
But not the Iast.

694
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,774
Her name is Kunsong.

695
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:59,278
We found her blood
in your mom's delivery van.

696
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:02,214
We know that you used
that van to dump her body.

697
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:05,278
We also know

698
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,345
that she came
to your apartment
by accident,

699
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,255
Iooking to buy a couch.

700
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:15,885
(SIGHS)

701
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:23,027
STABLER: Does that help?

702
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:39,685
She was Iike something
out of my dreams.

703
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,848
So I invited her in.

704
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:50,220
She just had the most
perfect, tiny feet.

705
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:54,763
AII I did was compliment her.

706
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,499
Things were going
really well, too,

707
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:00,666
until she asked
where the couch was.

708
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:03,536
AII right. And so then
what happened?

709
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,136
She ran for the door.

710
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:08,945
I stopped her.

711
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,778
I asked her to try on
a pair of shoes for me.

712
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,586
She told me I was sick.

713
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:24,690
I snapped.

714
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,258
You didn't mean to kill her.

715
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:30,668
No. No, no. One minute,
I'm sitting at home alone

716
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:33,898
fixing the TV,
and the next minute,
there's a dead girl.

717
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,844
You were rewiring your TV?

718
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:38,003
Yeah.

719
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,539
You use copper wire
for that, right?

720
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:43,948
We found the knife
that you used on her foot,

721
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:45,280
back in your mom's bakery.

722
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:47,548
It was nice of you
to bring it back.

723
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:50,546
BENSON: Jerry...

724
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:54,927
Why did you cut
her foot off?

725
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,032
For my collection.

726
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:07,474
They just Iooked...

727
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:11,203
They just Iooked better
with a real foot.

728
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:22,456
CABOT: We need to serve
the motions to Talbot

729
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:24,957
and pull the statements
on the Simpson
and Powell cases.

730
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:26,960
Oh, AIex, yoo-hoo.
Hi, Gina.

731
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:28,518
I'II see you back
at the office.
AII right.

732
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:29,620
Hi.

733
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:30,891
Nice shoes.

734
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:32,626
Thanks.
I hate them, too.

735
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,602
But more importantly,
so does Jerry Dupree,
my shoe fetishist.

736
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:38,161
It's the only way
I can get him
to concentrate

737
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,036
on the matter at hand
and not on my feet.

738
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,836
You're prosecuting,
right?

739
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:44,104
You know I am, Gina.
You've served me
with enough motions.

740
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,271
Right.
I've got a few more.

741
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:47,814
You saved me a trip.

742
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:50,177
I don't want
to wear out
these puppies.

743
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:52,116
Request for
a 7:30 hearing.

744
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,017
Psych eval.
Very original.

745
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:57,752
Thanks. IQ and physical

746
00:30:57,826 --> 00:30:59,088
and neurological.

747
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:01,094
What, no proctologist?

748
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,460
No, not this time.

749
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:06,266
Gina, you and I both know
any affirmative defense
you come up with

750
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:08,269
is going to be
a Ioad of crap.

751
00:31:11,974 --> 00:31:13,066
BERNARDO: Dr. Shelton,

752
00:31:13,141 --> 00:31:16,201
what exactly
does the brain's
frontal Iobe do?

753
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:19,240
It controls emotions, urges,

754
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,110
knowledge of
right and wrong.

755
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,708
Basically, it's our
impulse control center.

756
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:25,646
So...

757
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:30,423
Say I had the urge to
call opposing counsel

758
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:32,890
an uptight,
self-righteous,
Iittle bitch,

759
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:37,388
my frontal Iobe knows
that means sanctions
and it keeps my mouth shut?

760
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:41,467
Yes. It imposes
appropriate inhibitions.

761
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:45,595
Did you conduct a series
of neurological tests
on Jerry Dupree?

762
00:31:45,674 --> 00:31:46,800
I did.

763
00:31:48,477 --> 00:31:49,466
Is...

764
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:52,246
Is there anything
wrong there?

765
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:56,374
I found evidence of a recent
subdural hematoma right there.

766
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:58,045
Here?
Yes.

767
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,746
It's a benign
mass of blood,

768
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:02,221
putting pressure
on his frontal Iobe.

769
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:04,892
My God.
What does that mean?

770
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,550
Well, anyone who's
read my book knows

771
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:08,755
it can produce radical
personality changes.

772
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,390
I have well-documented
cases Iinking it

773
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:14,299
to violence and
a predisposition
to criminal behavior.

774
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:17,397
So, damaging
your frontal Iobe

775
00:32:17,506 --> 00:32:20,202
is Iike somebody cutting
the brakes to your car.

776
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:22,368
There is no way
to stop yourself.

777
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:25,078
That's one way
of putting it.

778
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:27,509
Now, if you'II flip
to his PET scan.

779
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:30,743
Thank you.

780
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:34,017
The one on the top
is a normal
functioning brain.

781
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,621
The red indicates
increased brain metabolism,

782
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:38,626
a sign of high
brain activity.

783
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,953
BERNARDO: The one
on the bottom is Jerry's.

784
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:42,763
Why is his so blue?

785
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:46,330
It illustrates decreased
frontal brain activity,

786
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,869
resulting from atrophy
due to his injury.

787
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:50,894
So

788
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:54,767
would this explain
a previously meek,

789
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:57,903
gentle person
suddenly turning violent?

790
00:32:58,246 --> 00:32:59,338
Absolutely.

791
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:02,449
It disinhibits and,
in extreme cases,

792
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:06,279
renders one
virtually incapable
of controlling one's urges.

793
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:10,453
Dr. Shelton, are you saying
that everyone who suffers

794
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:12,686
a blow to the frontal Iobe
will kill?

795
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:14,160
SHELTON: No, of course not.

796
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:16,690
There are numerous cases
in the history of brain...

797
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:17,789
CABOT: Thank you.

798
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,766
You've offered a very
provocative theory.

799
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:23,703
What it Iacks in substance
it makes up for
in pretty colors.

800
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:28,500
I've studied
the criminal brain
for the past 20 years.

801
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,837
The most vicious
were overwhelmingly

802
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:32,812
those with a combination
of abusive childhoods,

803
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:36,078
psychotic symptoms
and brain injuries.

804
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:39,946
How many people
participated in your study?

805
00:33:40,455 --> 00:33:42,582
One hundred
and eighty-seven.

806
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:47,056
And how many people
suffer brain injuries
in a given year?

807
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:50,431
I don't have
the exact number.

808
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:52,694
The number is 500,000.

809
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:57,594
That's a half a million
predominately
Iaw-abiding citizens.

810
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:02,234
Pretty much dwarfs
your Iittle study,
wouldn't you say?

811
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:06,077
My study included
some of your most
infamous serial killers,

812
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:09,139
including Bundy,
Dahmer, Shawcross,

813
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:11,447
Mark David Chapman,
Joel Rifkin...

814
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,215
CABOT: And now Jerry Dupree.

815
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:16,914
Thank you, Doctor.
No further questions.

816
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:21,926
MRS. KRUG: He was
the best Iittle boy.

817
00:34:22,497 --> 00:34:24,226
Never gave me
any trouble.

818
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,362
Even when his father died,

819
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:31,565
or when his
stepfather Ieft us,
he stayed sweet.

820
00:34:32,007 --> 00:34:34,305
He never fought,
he never cursed.

821
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:37,204
Was there a time
when that changed?

822
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:38,572
In January.

823
00:34:39,448 --> 00:34:40,574
What happened then?

824
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:42,207
My bakery was robbed.

825
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:45,680
A crazed man came in,
waving a hammer.

826
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,346
He told me that
he would kill me

827
00:34:48,957 --> 00:34:51,448
if I didn't give him
all the money
in the register.

828
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:53,426
Now, was Jerry
present at this time?

829
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:55,929
No, no. The man
started yelling,

830
00:34:56,765 --> 00:35:00,223
and that's when
Jerry heard him
all the way upstairs.

831
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:01,766
BERNARDO:
And what did he do?

832
00:35:01,837 --> 00:35:03,202
He came to my rescue.

833
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:06,468
He tried to pull the weapon
from the man, but...

834
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:09,569
He got him,

835
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,311
right in the head.

836
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:14,641
Struck him in the head.

837
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:18,148
Your Honor, I'd Iike to
submit into evidence

838
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,211
Defense exhibits 21,

839
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:22,487
the police report
of the robbery,

840
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:25,754
and 22, hospital records
of Jerry's concussion.

841
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:27,292
CORWIN: So entered.

842
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:32,360
Now, how Iong after this
did you notice a change
in Jerry's personality?

843
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:36,268
Immediately. He had
headaches all the time.

844
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:40,773
He would burst
into fits of anger
at the Ieast Iittle thing.

845
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:43,037
And he started swearing.

846
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:45,808
And you are
absolutely positive

847
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:49,450
that this did not occur
until after the attack?

848
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:51,109
Yes.

849
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:55,685
My son is not the same person.
But that is not his fault.

850
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,687
The man who hurt him
should be on trial
for this murder,

851
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:01,252
not Jerry. He was...

852
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:04,565
He was protecting
his mother.

853
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:09,161
She has them believing
Jerry's a hero.

854
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:11,035
Well, the robbery case
is still open.

855
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:14,167
No Ieads on the perp.
But the mother did
file a report that day.

856
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:16,234
Brain injury's
Iegitimate, too.

857
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:19,042
But not as an excuse.
Just Iook at our victim.

858
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:22,414
Kunsong endured
every abuse imaginable,
and she never hurt a soul.

859
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:23,952
It is a pretty
sick irony.

860
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,011
She survives hell
only to meet Jerry.

861
00:36:26,322 --> 00:36:28,722
Who's apparently
a bit of a klutz.

862
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,315
CABOT: What do you mean?

863
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:34,227
Gina's expert concentrated
on the functional damage,
proving the injury,

864
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:36,697
but there's numerous
indications here
of structural damage.

865
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:38,757
Are you saying he's been
hit in the head before?

866
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:41,325
Repeatedly.
But not Iimited
to the frontal Iobe.

867
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:43,770
And from the Iooks
of some of these
healed Iesions,

868
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,636
over a Iong period of time.

869
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,368
It's funny, the mother
never mentioned these.

870
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:50,435
Probably because they weren't
from defending helpless women

871
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:51,502
and children.

872
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:53,740
Maybe the Iast one
wasn't, either.

873
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:57,147
Good mothers have been known
to make excuses for bad sons.

874
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:00,385
Find me evidence
she perjured herself.

875
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,050
MUNCH: How badly
was Jerry hurt?

876
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:07,027
When we found him,
his pupils weren't reactive.

877
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:08,290
He couldn't answer
basic questions,

878
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:09,922
and he drifted
in and out of
consciousness.

879
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,466
I take it the mother
was hysterical.

880
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:13,900
She insisted on riding along.
Wouldn't Ieave his side.

881
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,370
We had to physically
pull her away
just to check his vitals.

882
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,736
MUNCH: She tell you
what happened?

883
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:19,570
When we first got there,
the Iittle brother told us

884
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:21,610
he found him unconscious,
couldn't wake him up.

885
00:37:21,677 --> 00:37:22,905
Wait a minute.
Where was the mother?

886
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:25,209
Downstairs in the bakery.

887
00:37:25,514 --> 00:37:26,981
MUNCH: Wasn't
Jerry down there?

888
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:29,483
No. We responded
to the residence upstairs.

889
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:31,144
He was in his bedroom.

890
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:33,311
Why would my mom Iie?

891
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:34,651
To protect Jerry.

892
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:37,383
We figure she had
to do that a Iot.

893
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,518
No.

894
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:40,221
You know, if your mom's
making up stories,

895
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:41,695
or if she knows of
other women he's hurt,

896
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:43,527
then she could go
to jail, too.

897
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,624
You don't want that,
now, do you?

898
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:52,304
Brendan, we know your mom
wants to protect Jerry
because she Ioves him.

899
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:55,032
But he's already
ruined enough Iives.

900
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:57,602
Don't Iet him hurt your mom
any more than he already has.

901
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,581
You don't even know her.
She's the one who hurt him.

902
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:03,418
Your mom hit Jerry
that night?

903
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:06,086
Yes.
STABLER: Why?

904
00:38:06,322 --> 00:38:07,880
Same reason as always.

905
00:38:07,957 --> 00:38:10,755
She caught him with
another pair of Iady's shoes.

906
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:14,958
First time she caught him,
he was five years old.

907
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:17,829
Has she been
hitting Jerry
ever since?

908
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:21,467
She blames Jerry
for our dad Ieaving us

909
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:23,129
since he was
such an embarrassment.

910
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:25,036
What did she hit him with
that night?

911
00:38:25,107 --> 00:38:27,098
The Iady's shoe
she caught him with.

912
00:38:27,176 --> 00:38:28,905
It had a big wooden heel.

913
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:32,078
Brendan, does your mom
ever hit you?

914
00:38:32,148 --> 00:38:35,083
Sometimes. But I'm a Iot
quicker than Jerry.

915
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:37,243
She's definitely
gonna whale on me

916
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,550
when she finds out
I told you all this.

917
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:42,523
You Ieave my mother
out of this.

918
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:44,115
Afraid that we can't
do that, Jerry.

919
00:38:44,193 --> 00:38:46,718
Not after the blow by blow
Brendan gave us.

920
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:49,463
Jerry, we can
plead you guilty
but not responsible,

921
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:51,159
but you have got
to work with us.

922
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:52,632
My mother
never hit me.

923
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:54,727
Why would your brother
say that?

924
00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:56,900
To protect me.

925
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:58,672
Like Dr. Sorenson,

926
00:38:59,308 --> 00:39:01,299
who treated you when
your mother put you
in the hospital?

927
00:39:01,377 --> 00:39:02,503
She didn't!

928
00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:07,080
He told your mother
that your head injury
was severe.

929
00:39:07,149 --> 00:39:08,946
That you had
to be careful.

930
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,143
No.

931
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,619
BENSON: That with
any further trauma,

932
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:14,883
the consequences
could be devastating.

933
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:19,893
Jerry, did she hit you
again after that?

934
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,697
I killed that girl.

935
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,033
I belong in prison.

936
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,831
You belong in a hospital.

937
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:31,938
You heard the expert.
They can't fix me.

938
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:36,106
If I get out,
I'II just do it again.

939
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:37,440
BENSON: Like your mom?

940
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:41,080
Tell me what's gonna happen
when Brendan does something

941
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,139
to piss her off.

942
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:44,814
JERRY: He won't.
No?

943
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:47,954
He's not Iike me.
He's normal.

944
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:53,558
Jerry, your mother's
used to taking out
her frustrations on somebody.

945
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,797
Now, who's that person
gonna be when you're
out of the house?

946
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:07,806
There was a girl
in the bakery.

947
00:40:08,844 --> 00:40:10,937
I started talking
about her shoes.

948
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:14,444
Right in front of Ma.

949
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:16,280
Okay. What happened?

950
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:22,580
She went crazy.
Came after me
with a frying pan.

951
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:28,262
I told her,
"Not my head, Ma."

952
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:32,328
It just made her madder.

953
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,434
She caught me
on the side of my head,

954
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:38,437
knocked me down,

955
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,138
kept hitting.

956
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,177
I begged her to stop.

957
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:49,573
"Ma, please, remember
what the doctor said."

958
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:55,315
She grabbed the handle
with both hands,

959
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,024
brought it down
as hard as she could.

960
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,227
That's the Iast thing
that I remember.

961
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,604
Here you go.
Enjoy, huh?

962
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:21,149
Enjoy it to go.
The rest of you might want
to find another bakery.

963
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:23,082
What are you doing?
PIacing you under arrest.

964
00:41:23,152 --> 00:41:24,176
What for?

965
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:25,777
BENSON: The murder
of Kunsong Bennett.

966
00:41:25,855 --> 00:41:28,517
Oh, that's insane.
I had nothing
to do with that.

967
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:29,615
Yeah, you did.

968
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:31,683
You caused the injuries that
turned Jerry into a killer.

969
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,921
What?
That's depraved indifference.

970
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:35,020
Murder two.

971
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:36,655
I didn't make him
the way that he is.

972
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:38,131
There's always something
wrong with him.

973
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,895
I did everything
I could to fix it.

974
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,027
With blows to the head?

975
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:42,593
Nothing else worked!

976
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:44,972
You don't know what
he put me through!

977
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,234
Oh, don't Iook at me
Iike that.

978
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:48,401
I am not the one
that's sick.

979
00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:50,672
You know me.

980
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:52,244
You know that
I'm a good mother.

981
00:41:52,314 --> 00:41:54,282
You tell them that
I'm a good mother!

982
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,510
Tell them!
