00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:00,962
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:04,267
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,932
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,943
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:12,310
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:14,309
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,146
We're good to go.

8
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:18,208
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,309
Damn it.

10
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:23,790
I got to take this.

11
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:26,292
Make a sound,
and I'II cut your balls off.

12
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:31,231
Hi, sweetie.
What's wrong?

13
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,595
What the hell?

14
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:34,735
Mommy will be home soon.

15
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:37,863
Wake the sitter and have her
give you some cough medicine.

16
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,964
Mmm-hmm.
Where does it hurt?

17
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:41,335
Hey, can I get
my money back?

18
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,241
Oh, no. Your tummy
hurts you, too?

19
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:44,403
Screw you.

20
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:46,446
I'II be home...
I can find a hotter
piece of ass

21
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:48,210
with a Iot Iess baggage.

22
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:49,807
(CLATTERING)

23
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:52,815
Oh, my God.

24
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:57,555
My partner and I were
patrolling a block away
when we heard screaming.

25
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:58,615
You heard the attack?

26
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:00,320
No, no. The discovery.

27
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:02,295
Tough guy in the parka.

28
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,056
I didn't see anything.

29
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,394
STABLER: Sexually posed,
put on display.

30
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,437
Our boy wants to read
about this in the paper.

31
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:11,495
Ligature marks
around the neck.

32
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,469
No other apparent wounds.

33
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,433
Except for the skirt.

34
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:18,608
Wasn't short enough
for somebody.
It's been cut off.

35
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,978
We got blood on the boot.
Maybe she got a piece of him.

36
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,778
BENSON: I'II grab
an evidence bag.

37
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,121
Liv. I don't think
the blood's our perp's.

38
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,683
It's hers.

39
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:37,728
Guys, anyone find
a severed foot?

40
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:28,742
Stump's pretty
chewed up.

41
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,842
Sawed off,
as opposed to
one good hack.

42
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,079
Perp used a saw?

43
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:34,714
BIade wasn't that thick,
but it was serrated.

44
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:37,950
Based on the hesitation marks,
I'd say two millimeter width.

45
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:39,823
It's your garden-variety
kitchen knife.

46
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:42,295
Probably upper-end.
See the impression here?

47
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:43,661
It's from the hilt guard.

48
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,063
Only your better
knives have them.

49
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,124
He chop her pre
or post-mortem?

50
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:50,136
No bruising, minimal clotting,
so she was already dead

51
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:52,264
as a result of
Iigature strangulation.

52
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,570
Yeah, now that Iooks too thin
to be a belt or a rope.

53
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:56,702
WARNER: Wire. He thoughtfully
used enough force

54
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,507
to show me that
it was braided.

55
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,512
Ten threads,
12 or 14 gauge.

56
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:02,880
Can you be a Iittle bit
more specific?

57
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:07,045
It Ieft no visible residue,
but if we get a reaction
with rubionic acid...

58
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,315
WARNER: It was copper.

59
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:12,155
Well, she was found
in the red Iight district.

60
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,821
If she was on the stroll,
we've probably got her prints.

61
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,090
No hits.

62
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:19,191
AIso, no STDs
or cervical dysplasia.

63
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,632
She probably
wasn't a pro.

64
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,102
So, all we have is
Asian, mid-twenties.

65
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,128
With a painful past.

66
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,175
I found healed burn marks
on the genitals.

67
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,571
We've seen that
before. Cigarettes?

68
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,838
More conducive with
an electro-shock device.

69
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:34,313
And then there's this.

70
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,216
See the nine metacarpal bones,
making up the wrist?

71
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,953
Hers are disrupted.

72
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:43,257
She also has old tears
to her rotator cuffs.

73
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,189
She was hung by her wrists.

74
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:47,756
And tortured.

75
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,758
CRAGEN: Are we thinking
the guy who tortured her
in the past

76
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,026
finished the job Iast night?

77
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,567
Well, those scars are
a couple of years old.

78
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:55,569
That's a pretty big gap
between the attacks.

79
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:57,696
Assuming the first go-around
was an attack.

80
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,740
They sure as hell
weren't self-inflicted.

81
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:01,708
Nothing with
Missing Persons yet.

82
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:05,576
Restraints, painful game
of shock the kitty.
Smacks of S&M to me.

83
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,739
I know one woman's pain
can be another man's pleasure,

84
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,681
but this girl was not
spanked to death.

85
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:10,911
Say she hooks up
with a guy.

86
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,351
She's down with
the whips and chains,

87
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,786
but she bolts when he
revs up the cattle prod.

88
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:17,882
I don't know. George,
bondage/discipline
track for you?

89
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,551
These old scars
are political torture.

90
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:20,959
STABLER:
Where do you get that?

91
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,692
They're trademark techniques
used by the Chinese military
occupying Tibet.

92
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:25,926
I'd say she was Tibetan.

93
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:28,168
Meaning that she had
the audacity to support

94
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,033
the Dalai Lama
or an independent Tibet.

95
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:32,232
Maybe she was a nun.
I understand they're
a favorite target.

96
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:33,797
Right, Agent Huang?

97
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,874
According to Physicians
for Human Rights,
of which I'm a member.

98
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,675
CRAGEN: Maybe cutting off
the foot was a message.

99
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,773
Could a torturer have
followed her here?

100
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,839
Anything's possible.

101
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:45,715
AII right, then maybe
she came seeking
political asylum.

102
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,254
Check with the INS.

103
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:50,755
JOHNSON: Do you have any idea
how many immigrants
we get a year?

104
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,690
We're really only
interested in one.

105
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:55,924
A million,
10% of whom claim to be
political refugees.

106
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:58,999
But then there's
the million and a half
who try to sneak in illegally.

107
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,331
Gee, it's almost Iike
someone hung out a sign,
welcoming

108
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:03,394
your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses,
and then they...

109
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:04,870
Hey, we got a hit.

110
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:09,903
FIN: Kunsong Tashi.
Huang was right.

111
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,343
Birthplace, Tibet.

112
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:12,937
Was she granted
political asylum?

113
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,380
Never applied.
She got in on
a marriage visa.

114
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,476
So there's a husband
in the picture.
What's his name?

115
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:21,087
Preston Bennett.

116
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,716
BENSON: How did
you two meet?

117
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:30,495
(SNIFFLES) At the bazaar
at Dharamsala.

118
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:34,195
I found a 10th century
stone Vishnu,

119
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:35,998
but the merchant
spoke no English.

120
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:39,365
Kunsong was walking by,
and she interpreted for us.

121
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:45,339
And your relationship now
was still strong?

122
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:48,377
We never fought,
not once.

123
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:52,048
Mr. Bennett,
I got to tell you,
I find it awfully odd

124
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,281
that you didn't
report her missing.

125
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:56,913
I assumed she was
at the Center.

126
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,515
BENSON:
Which center is that?

127
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,153
It's a program at Bellevue
for torture survivors.

128
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,594
She was tortured
in Tibet?

129
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,935
Yes. For attending
a demonstration.

130
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:12,095
The police came,
rounded everyone up.

131
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,367
They kept her a month.

132
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,573
This center
that you mentioned,

133
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,577
was she having trouble
with anybody there?

134
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,306
No, it was a godsend.

135
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,577
We found it when
she first got here.

136
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,379
It helped her so much,
now she volunteers there.

137
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,818
Was she in the habit of
staying there all night?

138
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,219
She was there
constantly.

139
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,622
She had group therapy,
she interpreted.

140
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:35,322
And whenever a new survivor
entered the program,
she'd sit with them.

141
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:36,489
AII night?

142
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:37,620
Sometimes.

143
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,030
Without calling?

144
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:41,726
Yes.

145
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:45,430
I'm not buying it.

146
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:46,701
Kathy didn't come home
all night,

147
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:47,969
I'd be out
Iooking for her.

148
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,304
That's you.
That's everybody.

149
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:50,401
That's bull.

150
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,412
How many times have
we been working on a case

151
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,606
and Kathy doesn't
hear from you?

152
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,875
That's different.
I'm on the job.

153
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,213
Well, according
to her husband,
so was Kunsong.

154
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,856
She'd spend hours Iistening
to victims' horror stories,

155
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,291
even though
it usually meant

156
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:07,953
opening up
old wounds
of her own.

157
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,360
We saw the scars.

158
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,358
(SIGHS) They don't begin
to tell the story.

159
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,425
In prison, she was
stripped naked,

160
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:18,702
held in a small cage
for days without food,
and beaten around the clock.

161
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,900
As if the taser
to the genitals
wasn't enough.

162
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,307
EIectro-shock batons
are a favorite.

163
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,475
Not only is
the pain unbearable,

164
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,242
they don't Ieave
physical scars.

165
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:28,304
They did on Kunsong.

166
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:31,216
Only because the guard
raping her got careless

167
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,446
and exceeded
the mandated voltage.

168
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:36,285
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

169
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,059
Our Tibetan support group
is about to start.

170
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,891
They wanted to
have a memorial.

171
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:43,664
This was Kunsong's group?

172
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:46,222
Yes.
They consider her family.

173
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:51,731
She made this for them.

174
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:54,005
Group meet yesterday?

175
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,669
No. But she was here
in the afternoon,

176
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,269
helping to translate
affidavits for asylum.

177
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,478
She Ieft around 5:00.
BENSON: AIone?

178
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:04,541
Yes. I wish I had asked
her where she was going.

179
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,780
What do you know
about her husband?

180
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,956
There was no marital discord.

181
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,250
Really?

182
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:16,160
It's hard to believe that
somebody who went through

183
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:19,257
what Kunsong did
would have an easy time
in a relationship.

184
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:21,569
Preston cared
about her deeply.

185
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:24,935
If anything, he was
overly protective.

186
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:27,337
Who did Kunsong
need protection from?

187
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,702
Attention, everyone.

188
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,972
We'II be starting in
just a minute, okay?

189
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,478
Who did Kunsong
need protection from?

190
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:37,809
You have to understand,

191
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:40,946
the purpose of torture
is to break a person's will

192
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,886
and destroy their humanity.

193
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:45,988
Some degree of paranoia
is not uncommon.

194
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,493
Well, seeing how
Kunsong died,

195
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,621
maybe her fears
weren't all in her head.

196
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,858
Nearly half a million
survivors of torture

197
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,798
have relocated to the U.S.

198
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:57,668
There's no telling how many
of their tormentors
have followed suit.

199
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:59,434
Did she mention
any run-ins?

200
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:02,476
No, but she had become
more of an activist recently.

201
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:03,602
STABLER: How so?

202
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:06,306
A fellow survivor from group,
Detchen Gyatso,

203
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,506
took her to her first protest
just Iast week.

204
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,880
Is Detchen here?

205
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,215
No, but I know where
you can find her.

206
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,276
DETCHEN: Freedom for Tibet!

207
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:14,582
MUNCH: I'd say
she's our organizer.

208
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,055
Freedom for Tibet!

209
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:17,557
Freedom for Tibet!

210
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,616
Freedom for...
Detchen Gyatso?

211
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:21,456
We have a right
to be here.

212
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,587
We're not blocking traffic

213
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:25,098
and we're not obstructing
China's corrupt,
oppressive regime.

214
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,997
MUNCH: Hey, hey,
more power to you.

215
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:28,559
What do you want?

216
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,035
Want to talk to you
about Kunsong.

217
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,197
I understand she started
fighting the good fight
just Iast week.

218
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,036
Was it right out here
in front of the consulate?

219
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,837
No, a brokerage firm.

220
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,274
Myer Miller's.

221
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:39,836
A new stock offering
is funding a pipeline
through Tibet.

222
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,142
But we are hurting them.

223
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:45,117
The parent company has already
reduced their U.S. sale
from seven to five billion.

224
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,279
I've seen men killed
for a pizza.

225
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:49,422
Billions at stake?
That's motive for murder.

226
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,481
Anybody roughed up
at Iast week's soiree?

227
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,857
We're talking Times Square,
not Tiananmen.

228
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,623
Not even an idle threat?

229
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:58,598
Jerks didn't even
call the cops.
No arrests, no ink.

230
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,825
Only person taken away
all day was Kunsong.

231
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:01,891
MUNCH: By whom?

232
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,301
Her husband.

233
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,004
He showed up,
pulled her out of Iine.

234
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:07,337
He was yelling,
she was crying.

235
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:10,106
She didn't get to
finish the protest.

236
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,570
As I recall, the husband
stated they'd never fight.

237
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:15,741
Wonder what his
Iittle demonstration
was all about.

238
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,216
DETCHEN: Freedom for Tibet!

239
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:18,913
Freedom for...

240
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,042
Well?

241
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,554
It wasn't a fight.

242
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,783
You dragged your wife away
in tears in front of
a hundred witnesses.

243
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,224
A week before her murder.

244
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,455
You don't understand.
Oh, we understand
that you Iied to us.

245
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,655
I was just trying
to protect her.

246
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:32,097
Yeah? From what?
Facing her fears,
or moving on?

247
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,191
The more independent she grew,
the Iess control you had?

248
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:35,360
It was too soon.

249
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,460
To get on with her Iife?

250
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:39,438
We were at the end of our
three-year probation period
with the INS.

251
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:43,273
If she had been arrested,
she could have been
deported back to hell.

252
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,605
Dug up something
on your boy here.

253
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,741
Turns out he has
a history with us.

254
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:53,109
What? I've never been
arrested in my Iife.

255
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:56,951
No. But a patrol car
responded to a 911 call
at your residence.

256
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,719
What was that?
Another fight you never had?

257
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:03,121
A neighbor misinterpreted
something he heard.

258
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:05,688
Kunsong screaming
bloody murder
in the middle of the night.

259
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,325
On a regular basis.

260
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,833
How's that open
to interpretation?

261
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:10,632
She had nightmares!

262
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:14,430
She tried everything,
even sleeping upright
in a chair.

263
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,609
Still, she'd wake up
thinking she was
back in Tibet.

264
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,737
The nightmares were so real,

265
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,407
even with me holding her,
she couldn't stop screaming.

266
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,211
Well, someone shut her up.

267
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:26,814
With a wire across
her vocal chords.

268
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:29,383
I'm a Buddhist,
for God's sake.

269
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:30,981
I could never take a Iife.

270
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:33,356
That's funny.
I talked to the neighbor
that reported you.

271
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,293
I guess you forgot
your pacifist crap

272
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,490
when you threatened him
the next day.

273
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,395
Do you have any idea
how much trauma he caused her?

274
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:40,798
BENSON: By calling the police?

275
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,098
Two men in uniform, showing up
in the middle of the night,

276
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:45,571
that's how nightmares begin
where she's from.

277
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,235
And unless this is
a police state, too,
I assume I'm free to Ieave.

278
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,815
He's Iying.

279
00:11:59,187 --> 00:12:00,449
STABLER: Husband
is a broken record.

280
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,920
Every problem we find
in their marriage,

281
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,219
he explains away with
his wife's horrible past.

282
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,385
He may Iie,
but paper trails don't.

283
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:08,725
He take out
an insurance policy
on Kunsong?

284
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,229
There's nothing.
As far as I can tell,

285
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,027
he's not making a penny
from her death.

286
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,863
How we doing on
shaking his alibi?

287
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:16,699
CIaims he was home alone.
I haven't found a soul
to confirm that.

288
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:18,102
You pull his LUDs?

289
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,037
Night of the murder,
not a single call.

290
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,302
Of course not.
He wasn't there.

291
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,740
Well, it doesn't
prove he wasn't.

292
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,801
Well, this does.
I pulled Preston's
financials.

293
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,074
There's a charge
on his corporate card
at 6:00 that night.

294
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:29,173
CRAGEN: Where?
A place called Hello Dalai.

295
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,241
What is that?
BENSON: I've been there.

296
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,420
It's a Iittle
Tibetan restaurant
in the Village.

297
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,624
FIN: You recognize
Mr. Bennett?

298
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,684
Sure. He and his wife
are regulars.

299
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:41,990
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

300
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:43,826
He hasn't been here
in a couple of weeks.

301
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,560
According to his
credit card company,
he was here Iast Tuesday.

302
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:48,864
You've got it backwards.
His wife was, he wasn't.

303
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,096
You sure about that?

304
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,469
Positive. It was before
the dinner rush.

305
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,700
They were the only ones
in here.

306
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:54,901
They?

307
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,601
She was with a gentleman.
MUNCH: Describe him.

308
00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:59,111
Brown hair, thirtyish.

309
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,205
Scars, tattoos,
anything unusual?

310
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:04,940
Perfect tan in February
kind of stood out.
That and his hefty tip.

311
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,782
Wait a minute. That was
her husband's card,

312
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,685
so she would've had
to sign for the meal.

313
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:10,314
No, I'm sure he signed.

314
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,188
FIN: Think you still
got that receipt?

315
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,318
I'II check.

316
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:15,593
Husband's definitely
got motive now.

317
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:16,789
Not only was she
cheating on him,

318
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,923
she was using his money
to wine and dine her Iover.

319
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,365
Guy's sure got
a set on him.

320
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:22,834
Signing the husband's card?
That's cold.

321
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:24,701
I'm the manager.
Is there a problem?

322
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:26,740
Well, for starters,
a case of identity theft.

323
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:29,936
Someone other than
Mr. Bennett signed
a receipt Tuesday night.

324
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,308
You mean Mr. Chambers.

325
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,313
He's an authorized signer
on that card.

326
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:34,609
Who the hell's Mr. Chambers?

327
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,206
Mr. Bennett's partner.

328
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,252
He's the "C"
in B & C Importers.

329
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,877
Mr. Bennett's
business partner.

330
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:42,684
The triangle thickens.

331
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:45,889
STABLER: Ryan Chambers?
Yes.

332
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,019
BENSON: Like to talk to you
about Kunsong Bennett.

333
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,528
Do you mind
if we come in?

334
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:50,655
This really isn't
a good time.

335
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:52,426
STABLER: Well, you know,
for us, either.

336
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,435
We would've preferred
to talk to you the day
her body was discovered.

337
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:59,269
But at the time,
we hadn't yet heard about
your torrid Iittle affair.

338
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:01,066
What are you talking about?

339
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,973
STABLER: Preston know
you were banging his wife?

340
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,774
(SCOFFS) I doubt it,
since I wasn't.

341
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,380
You got a sense of humor.
That's good.

342
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,848
That'II serve you well
in prison.

343
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,542
What?

344
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,814
You were the Iast person
who saw her alive.

345
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,185
You're going to need
to come with us.

346
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,417
PRESTON:
That won't be necessary.

347
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:26,329
So the marriage was a sham.

348
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:28,600
Did Kunsong know?

349
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:30,261
Of course she did.

350
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:32,272
But we really did
care for each other.

351
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:35,102
That's why I married her.
It was the only way
to bring her here.

352
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:36,268
STABLER: You cared so much,

353
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:39,279
why have you been obstructing
her murder investigation?

354
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,473
I panicked.

355
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,176
You have to understand.
I violated federal
immigration Iaws.

356
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:44,718
The INS could
put him in prison.

357
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,343
Not to mention
take away our business.

358
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,910
You don't want us
to fill them in,

359
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,184
then I suggest you tell us
what happened that night.

360
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:53,625
If I had any information
about her killer,
I would have told you.

361
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,389
What happened at dinner?

362
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,863
Nothing.
We had a quick bite,

363
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,593
went our separate ways.
I came home and Preston
was already here.

364
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,260
It was a bury-the-hatchet
dinner.

365
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,167
You and Kunsong
had problems?

366
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,297
She was very sweet,
but it was going on
three years.

367
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:07,932
It was putting a strain
on our relationship.

368
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,442
Which she sensed.

369
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,644
That's why she moved out.

370
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,736
She what?

371
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,212
We put the apartment
in my name,

372
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:16,182
so the INS
wouldn't find out.

373
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,250
BENSON: How's it going, guys?

374
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:22,016
No sign of blood.

375
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,550
No sign of a struggle.

376
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,627
Not much to disturb.

377
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:30,731
Free Tibet. She was
disturbing someone.

378
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:32,756
BENSON: Got a notepad.
Yeah?

379
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,596
Nothing. Just a grocery Iist.

380
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:35,658
Bag it.

381
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,536
ANSWERING MACHINE:
You have no messages.

382
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:41,808
Guess she wasn't
real popular.
CIassifieds.

383
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:45,104
She was Iooking
to buy used furniture.

384
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,544
She needed it.

385
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:49,844
She had two stars
by a floral,
shabby-chic couch.

386
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,053
She was going
to see this one.

387
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,486
The day she died.

388
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:01,394
She called. I told her
to come by after 6:00.

389
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:03,454
I was here all night,
she never showed.

390
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,090
She was having dinner
four blocks from here.

391
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,725
It would've been
right on her way.

392
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:08,235
I don't know
what to tell you.

393
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:10,430
This is not the couch
in your ad.

394
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:12,173
I sold it.
To whom?

395
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:16,039
Some sorority chick.
I don't know, Buffy,
Cindy, something Iike that.

396
00:16:16,111 --> 00:16:17,135
She paid cash.

397
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:18,736
Mostly women
answer your ad?

398
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:19,872
Yeah.

399
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:23,081
You don't strike me
as a floral, shabby-chic
kind of guy.

400
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:26,552
I'm not.
That's why I sold it.
It belonged to my ex.

401
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,418
Now, why would she
Ieave a catch Iike you?

402
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,516
'Cause she's a whore.
And she found a fatter wallet.

403
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:32,855
That knife collection hers?

404
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:35,396
That worthless bitch
couldn't boil water.

405
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:38,529
Those are mine.

406
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:41,225
It's a perfect scam.

407
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,503
I mean, how many other ways
do you get women

408
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:46,473
to walk voluntarily into
a complete stranger's home?

409
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:50,039
Big bang for the buck.
CIassifieds are,
what, $5 a Iine?

410
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:52,012
Do we even know
this couch existed?

411
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,809
We're trying to
track down the ex.

412
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,110
What do we have
on this guy?

413
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:57,879
Paulie Obregano.
Two drunk and disorderlies,
but that was awhile ago.

414
00:16:57,953 --> 00:16:59,079
Well, if he's
a mean drunk,

415
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:01,145
his wife Ieaving
would give him
an ax to grind.

416
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:02,884
(PHONE RINGING)
Against a pretty
Iittle ankle bone.

417
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,823
Yeah, he had
the carving knives
to do it.

418
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:05,917
Benson, SVU.

419
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:07,154
It's all circumstantial.

420
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:09,527
We're gonna need
a Iot more than that
to get a search warrant.

421
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:12,863
That was the Iab.
They already have
something on the boots.

422
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:16,095
What've we got?
DNA? Prints?

423
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:18,669
No. But something's
definitely afoot.

424
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,833
These are a size nine.

425
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:22,542
I checked to make sure
it wasn't mismarked.

426
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:23,600
STABLER: Why?

427
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,976
Well, the victim's foot
measured nine and
three sixteenths inches.

428
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:28,539
That would make her
a size six and a half.

429
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,809
She was wearing shoes
two and a half sizes too big?

430
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:33,753
Hold on, these are
Jacques Le Corre.
These are $700 boots.

431
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,312
I mean, maybe
they were on sale, but...

432
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,914
Wouldn't that be
really uncomfortable?

433
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:40,120
Only if she bought
these boots for walking,
which she never did.

434
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:41,492
BENSON: They've got
wear marks right here.

435
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:42,723
TREVOR: Not where
they should be.

436
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:43,890
These roll to the outside.

437
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,934
According to
the autopsy report,
she was pigeon-toed.

438
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:48,930
These weren't her boots.

439
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:55,032
Some Prince Charming
slipped one of your shoes
on our victim.

440
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,805
Is there any kind
of hidden Iot number

441
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:58,436
that could tell us where
that shoe was purchased?

442
00:17:58,513 --> 00:17:59,605
Sorry, no.

443
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:02,215
Surely you must have
some way of tracking
your inventory.

444
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:03,945
That would be
on the shoebox.

445
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,646
Well, how many stores
are we talking about?

446
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,188
We're only carried
by the most exclusive.

447
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,226
Of course, given their
multiple chain Iocations
in the tri-state area,

448
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:13,659
about a thousand.

449
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,420
Every store carry
every design?

450
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:18,591
Every buyer carries
shoes that appeal to
their store's demographics.

451
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,157
Who stocks this one?

452
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:21,827
No one.

453
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:25,131
It's a prototype.
It's not due to hit shelves
for another month.

454
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,333
Who had access to it?

455
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,342
Laurie Schneider
reps that account.

456
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,207
Could you point us her way?

457
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:31,534
And go.

458
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,340
Okay, that's my Iast
model for this run.
I've got two minutes.

459
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,247
What can I tell you
about the Bellanobla model?

460
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:38,548
You know about a pair
walking off by themselves?

461
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,712
Size nine.

462
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:42,022
Crystal's our only
model that size.

463
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,853
She wore them
in a show Iast month.

464
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,517
Models get to keep
everything else in Iife.

465
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:47,084
They get to keep
the shoes, too?

466
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:48,493
They're not
supposed to, but...

467
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:49,552
Where can we find her?

468
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:50,655
LAURIE: Milan.

469
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:53,859
How can we contact her there?

470
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:55,330
Is that really necessary?

471
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:58,270
Did we mention that this is
a murder investigation?

472
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,769
Okay, she didn't
take them, I did.

473
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:03,276
For what I thought
was a hot date.

474
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:04,937
What, he knock
your boots off?

475
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:07,811
Trust me, this Ioser
didn't touch
anything of mine.

476
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:09,043
You know where he took me?

477
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,982
The Rock 'n' Roll Bowl.
MUNCH: Very trendy.

478
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,542
It's a bowling alley.

479
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:14,714
And just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse,

480
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,051
my boots disappeared.

481
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:17,250
Somebody jacked the boots?

482
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:19,520
Yes. It was
20 degrees outside.

483
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,893
I had to ride home
in my stocking feet.

484
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,453
At Ieast you got to keep
both of yours.

485
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:25,830
The next woman
wasn't so Iucky.

486
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:29,729
Yeah, I remember her.
She was really unhappy
with her date.

487
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:31,362
Totally hitting on me.

488
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,873
Really? Now, was that here
at the counter, or did she

489
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,000
Iure you down
to her Iane?

490
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:37,169
No, no. I was working
concessions that night.

491
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:39,008
I delivered several
pitchers of beer
to the Iady.

492
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,911
STABLER: How often do shoes
get stolen from here?

493
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:43,849
Hey, Jerry, we got
a pin stuck on Iane 17.
You wanna get on that?

494
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,547
BENSON: Hey, Marshall,
you didn't answer
the question.

495
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:48,715
Lots of shoes go missing
on your watch?

496
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,554
Well, no, they don't go
missing that often. But...

497
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,094
I mean, we get kids
playing pranks and stuff.

498
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,790
But between you and me,
I mean, that Iady
was so toasted

499
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:58,333
she probably dropped them
down the ball return.

500
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:00,198
Hey, buddy, buddy,

501
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,268
what's it Iike working
for Marshall the Kingpin?

502
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,772
I hate that guy.

503
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,068
You hate him?

504
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:08,872
He annoy the customers
as much as he annoys you?

505
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:12,476
Yeah, he hits on every girl
that walks through that door.
It's pathetic.

506
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:13,776
Oh, really?

507
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:16,547
I'm guessing he sees
a Iot of rejection.

508
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,780
Nothing but.
He never gets anywhere.

509
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:21,515
Well, aside from
this bad habit

510
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:23,525
of harassing women,
you ever see him

511
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:25,788
taking things that
don't belong to him?

512
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:31,195
I wouldn't put it past him.

513
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:33,265
STABLER: Yeah, go ahead.

514
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:37,231
Okay, any record of
bowling-alley guy
crossing the foul Iine?

515
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,364
He's clean.

516
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:40,136
He's young.
Maybe he hasn't
been caught yet.

517
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,972
Or maybe he hasn't
been reported yet.

518
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:43,477
I mean, who's going to
go to all the trouble

519
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,514
of reporting a pair
of stolen shoes?

520
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,981
You'd be surprised.
I pulled 61s on all crimes

521
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,041
where shoes came into play
in any way.

522
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,053
What, every pin
is a stolen shoe?

523
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:53,486
Not necessarily.

524
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,854
MUNCH: AII the red pins
represent the robberies
and the B and E's.

525
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:58,723
It doesn't make sense.
I mean, why break in
and just take shoes?

526
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:00,728
Because you got
a shoe fetish.

527
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:02,487
It's a sexual philia where

528
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:06,365
arousal is triggered by shoes,
feet, or even smelly socks.

529
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:07,795
That's one
I've never gotten.

530
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,303
HUANG: There are
plenty of theories.

531
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:10,361
It could just be
cross-wiring.

532
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:11,963
In the control map
of the brain,

533
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,406
the genitals are
right next to the feet.

534
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:17,105
More importantly,
are any of these break-ins
near the bowling alley?

535
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:20,410
The Rock 'n' Roll Bowl is here
in one of the Ieast hit areas.

536
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:22,451
He have any connection
to the Village?

537
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:24,076
'Cause that's our
heaviest concentration.

538
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:26,713
No. But Paulie,
the couch guy, does.

539
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,279
He Iives at

540
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,691
462 East Houston.

541
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:33,887
That's dead in the middle.

542
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:35,487
CRAGEN: What's the green pin?

543
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:37,530
MUNCH: Physical assault.
HUANG: Really?

544
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,392
Shoe fetishism isn't
usually a violent paraphilia.

545
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:42,835
An NYU graduate student,
Greta Thorsen,

546
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:45,533
two weeks ago, was choked
into unconsciousness.

547
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:48,042
And when she woke up,
her shoes were gone.

548
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,237
CRAGEN: She give
a description?
Couldn't.

549
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:53,743
Pull Paulie's
driver's Iicense photo.
Throw it into a photo array,

550
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:55,511
see if it jogs a memory.

551
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:57,983
GRETA: I don't know
what else I can tell you.

552
00:21:58,054 --> 00:21:59,783
But I'm going to be
Iate for class.

553
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:01,755
Those are nice
running shoes.

554
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:05,516
I'm 5'1", but no one knew
I was short because
I used to Iive in heels.

555
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:07,061
Now I'm afraid to wear them.

556
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:08,460
Is that since
the attack?

557
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:10,965
That bastard took
three inches off my Iife.

558
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:12,364
I'm not even
the same person.

559
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:14,960
I promise, helping us
is going to help you.

560
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:17,130
Now, tell us
everything you know.

561
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:18,430
It was dark.

562
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:21,203
I didn't see anyone around.
I was almost to my dorm.

563
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:23,507
AII of a sudden
there were hands
around my throat.

564
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:25,513
Do you recognize
any of these men?

565
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:28,880
I told you, he came up
from behind me.
I never saw his face.

566
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,151
Did he press up against you?

567
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,245
I tried to pull away.
He jerked me back.

568
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:35,017
My head hit his chin.

569
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:38,385
You're 5'4" with heels.
That would make him between

570
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:40,156
5'8" and 5'10".

571
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:41,728
STABLER: Can you walk us
through that day?

572
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:43,025
I was in classes
all day Iong

573
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,532
with about a million
other students.

574
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,828
Did you go off campus?

575
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:47,562
Just to the bakery
at Houston and Sullivan.

576
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:50,127
I was on my way
back from there
when it happened.

577
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:51,332
I got to go.

578
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:54,635
Paulie Iives on Houston.

579
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,938
Two blocks away.

580
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,741
MRS. KRUG: Greta
hasn't been in,
in a few weeks.

581
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:04,342
But she used to
come in at night
to stock up on muffins.

582
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,012
She hates
that dorm food.

583
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:08,454
Do you know this much
about all of your customers?

584
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:10,617
It's a real
neighborhood bakery.

585
00:23:11,193 --> 00:23:13,388
I know just about everybody
in a ten-block radius.

586
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:16,090
By order, mind you,
not necessarily by name.

587
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,430
BENSON: This girl's name
is Kunsong.

588
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:23,496
No.

589
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,669
No, I don't think
she's been in here.

590
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:27,606
How many employees
do you have working here?

591
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:30,839
Just Michael and Rodney.
But they're good guys.

592
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:32,642
And who's this?
MRS. KRUG: Brendan.

593
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:36,409
No. You'II ruin
your appetite.
He's my boy.

594
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:39,584
Any of these men customers?

595
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,852
(SIGHS)

596
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:45,315
This one.

597
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:47,620
That's pumpernickel
and olive Ioaf.

598
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:48,958
You've got your mom's
good memory.

599
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:50,726
Do either one of you remember

600
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,893
if he came in here
on the night of January 15th?

601
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:56,904
Two weeks ago? Well, no,
that I can't tell you.

602
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:58,769
But he is a regular.

603
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:06,405
Seriously, how Iong you
gonna keep jamming me up here?

604
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:09,448
BENSON: I don't know, Paulie.
That's up to you.

605
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,184
How would it help?

606
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,051
Louder or slower?
I didn't do anything.

607
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:21,457
We've got a murdered girl.

608
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,896
Our medical examiner
places her time of death

609
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:25,593
smack dab in the period

610
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:27,460
she was scheduled
to be in your apartment.

611
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:28,594
Coincidence.

612
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:30,366
We've got another girl,
attacked two weeks ago

613
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,236
after Ieaving one of
your favorite haunts.

614
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:35,004
Where?
Bakery, two blocks
from your apartment.

615
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:36,601
You know how many
people go in there?

616
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,078
That place is
always crammed.

617
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:39,444
Well, we also have a slew

618
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:42,006
of very peculiar burglaries
in your neighborhood.

619
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:43,278
This is unbelievable.

620
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:45,752
My thieving
whore of an ex
robs me blind,

621
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:47,584
and you accuse me
of stealing?

622
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,693
What do I gotta do
to prove to you

623
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,956
I've got nothing
to do with this?

624
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:56,993
Let us search
your apartment.

625
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,158
Fine.

626
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:03,896
BENSON: So what did we get?

627
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:06,840
Nothing indicating
Kunsong ever set foot
in Paulie's apartment.

628
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,604
We dusted floor to ceiling,
vacuumed the carpet.

629
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:10,372
Not a matching print,
hair or fiber.

630
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:11,435
What about
the knives?

631
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:13,209
No blood. There,
or in any of his drains.

632
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:14,715
Well, they told us
that you found something.

633
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:16,182
In her apartment,
not his.

634
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:17,583
Detectives,
remember the notepad

635
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:19,086
you picked up
by the victim's phone?

636
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:20,485
The one with
the grocery Iist
on it, yeah.

637
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:22,285
You find something
else there?
Nothing yet.

638
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:24,724
But the EIectrostatic
Detection Apparatus
can recover indented

639
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:27,057
writing three,
even four pages,
beneath the original.

640
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:29,654
Now, we vacuum Iock it
to the plate

641
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:32,928
and subject it
to a high-voltage
static charge.

642
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:35,997
Giving us a variably
charged surface

643
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:39,302
with the heavier static charge
remaining in any impressions,

644
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:41,776
which will attract this toner.

645
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:47,280
Which should give us
a carbon copy of the original.

646
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:48,540
CARLISLE: Yep.

647
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,816
Just Iike this.

648
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:55,350
Does "Couch, 642 East Houston,
apartment 2A,

649
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:56,449
"after 6:00" mean
anything to you?

650
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:57,955
Damn it, that's
Paulie's home address.

651
00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,655
No, it isn't.

652
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,920
His is 462.

653
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:04,862
She inverted the numbers.

654
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:07,560
STABLER: Well,
who the hell Iives there?

655
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,706
It's right next door
to the bakery.

656
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:12,332
It's Ieading to
the apartment upstairs.

657
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:13,774
Hey, Detectives.

658
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:15,945
You're just in time
for fresh banana bread.

659
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:17,377
That sounds great.

660
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:20,143
Listen, can you tell us
who Iives above the bakery?

661
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:21,205
I do.

662
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:25,787
Well, you didn't
recognize her
as a customer.

663
00:26:26,623 --> 00:26:29,649
Maybe she came by that day
Iooking for used furniture?

664
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:33,326
Well, I don't know
why she would.
I wasn't selling any.

665
00:26:33,396 --> 00:26:35,125
Well, is there
a Mr. Krug?

666
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,691
Somewhere.

667
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:39,861
So it's just you
and your son Brendan?

668
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:41,460
And his half-brother.

669
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:44,365
My son from my
first marriage. Jerry.

670
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:48,440
Hey, Jerry,
come out here, please.

671
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:50,501
What, Ma?

672
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,449
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Jerry.

673
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:02,423
We did a very
thorough search
of your room.

674
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:03,516
We found
your secret stash.

675
00:27:03,593 --> 00:27:05,117
You had no right
to touch my things.

676
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,594
Your things?
These aren't your things.

677
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:07,721
We've already
tied half of them

678
00:27:07,797 --> 00:27:09,094
to burglaries in
your neighborhood.

679
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:10,655
We talked
to your mom.

680
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:14,670
She said that she found you
wearing a pair Iike this
when you were five.

681
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:17,234
I'm not gay.

682
00:27:17,974 --> 00:27:20,135
I just Iike the way
that they Iook.

683
00:27:20,977 --> 00:27:23,775
On women.
So I collect them.
It's harmless.

684
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:25,209
It's harmless?

685
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,215
What happened to
the college student
who was wearing these?

686
00:27:30,553 --> 00:27:32,544
You nearly
choked her to death.

687
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:34,484
I don't know.

688
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:37,518
BENSON: You followed her
from the bakery.

689
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:39,958
Just to see where she Iived,

690
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,327
so that I could go
get them Iater.

691
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,796
Look, I swear, I swear,

692
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:49,033
this is the first time
that I ever hurt anybody.

693
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:50,264
But not the Iast.

694
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,774
Her name is Kunsong.

695
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:57,278
We found her blood
in your mom's delivery van.

696
00:27:57,347 --> 00:28:00,214
We know that you used
that van to dump her body.

697
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:03,278
We also know

698
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,345
that she came
to your apartment
by accident,

699
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:08,255
Iooking to buy a couch.

700
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:13,885
(SIGHS)

701
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:21,027
STABLER: Does that help?

702
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:37,685
She was Iike something
out of my dreams.

703
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,848
So I invited her in.

704
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:48,220
She just had the most
perfect, tiny feet.

705
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,763
AII I did was compliment her.

706
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:56,499
Things were going
really well, too,

707
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:58,666
until she asked
where the couch was.

708
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:01,536
AII right. And so then
what happened?

709
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:04,136
She ran for the door.

710
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:06,945
I stopped her.

711
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,778
I asked her to try on
a pair of shoes for me.

712
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,586
She told me I was sick.

713
00:29:21,598 --> 00:29:22,690
I snapped.

714
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,258
You didn't mean to kill her.

715
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:28,668
No. No, no. One minute,
I'm sitting at home alone

716
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:31,898
fixing the TV,
and the next minute,
there's a dead girl.

717
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:34,844
You were rewiring your TV?

718
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:36,003
Yeah.

719
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,539
You use copper wire
for that, right?

720
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:41,948
We found the knife
that you used on her foot,

721
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,280
back in your mom's bakery.

722
00:29:43,353 --> 00:29:45,548
It was nice of you
to bring it back.

723
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:48,546
BENSON: Jerry...

724
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:52,927
Why did you cut
her foot off?

725
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,032
For my collection.

726
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:05,474
They just Iooked...

727
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:09,203
They just Iooked better
with a real foot.

728
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:20,456
CABOT: We need to serve
the motions to Talbot

729
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:22,957
and pull the statements
on the Simpson
and Powell cases.

730
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:24,960
Oh, AIex, yoo-hoo.
Hi, Gina.

731
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:26,518
I'II see you back
at the office.
AII right.

732
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:27,620
Hi.

733
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:28,891
Nice shoes.

734
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:30,626
Thanks.
I hate them, too.

735
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,602
But more importantly,
so does Jerry Dupree,
my shoe fetishist.

736
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:36,161
It's the only way
I can get him
to concentrate

737
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,036
on the matter at hand
and not on my feet.

738
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:39,836
You're prosecuting,
right?

739
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:42,104
You know I am, Gina.
You've served me
with enough motions.

740
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:44,271
Right.
I've got a few more.

741
00:30:44,347 --> 00:30:45,814
You saved me a trip.

742
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:48,177
I don't want
to wear out
these puppies.

743
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,116
Request for
a 7:30 hearing.

744
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:52,017
Psych eval.
Very original.

745
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:56,752
Thanks. IQ and physical

746
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,088
and neurological.

747
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,094
What, no proctologist?

748
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:01,460
No, not this time.

749
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:05,266
Gina, you and I both know
any affirmative defense
you come up with

750
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:07,269
is going to be
a Ioad of crap.

751
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:12,066
BERNARDO: Dr. Shelton,

752
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:15,201
what exactly
does the brain's
frontal Iobe do?

753
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:18,240
It controls emotions, urges,

754
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:20,110
knowledge of
right and wrong.

755
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,708
Basically, it's our
impulse control center.

756
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:24,646
So...

757
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:29,423
Say I had the urge to
call opposing counsel

758
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,890
an uptight,
self-righteous,
Iittle bitch,

759
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:36,388
my frontal Iobe knows
that means sanctions
and it keeps my mouth shut?

760
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:40,467
Yes. It imposes
appropriate inhibitions.

761
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:44,595
Did you conduct a series
of neurological tests
on Jerry Dupree?

762
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:45,800
I did.

763
00:31:47,477 --> 00:31:48,466
Is...

764
00:31:49,312 --> 00:31:51,246
Is there anything
wrong there?

765
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:55,374
I found evidence of a recent
subdural hematoma right there.

766
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:57,045
Here?
Yes.

767
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,746
It's a benign
mass of blood,

768
00:31:58,821 --> 00:32:01,221
putting pressure
on his frontal Iobe.

769
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:03,892
My God.
What does that mean?

770
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,550
Well, anyone who's
read my book knows

771
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,755
it can produce radical
personality changes.

772
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,390
I have well-documented
cases Iinking it

773
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:13,299
to violence and
a predisposition
to criminal behavior.

774
00:32:13,803 --> 00:32:16,397
So, damaging
your frontal Iobe

775
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:19,202
is Iike somebody cutting
the brakes to your car.

776
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:21,368
There is no way
to stop yourself.

777
00:32:22,178 --> 00:32:24,078
That's one way
of putting it.

778
00:32:24,314 --> 00:32:26,509
Now, if you'II flip
to his PET scan.

779
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:29,743
Thank you.

780
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:33,017
The one on the top
is a normal
functioning brain.

781
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:35,621
The red indicates
increased brain metabolism,

782
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,626
a sign of high
brain activity.

783
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,953
BERNARDO: The one
on the bottom is Jerry's.

784
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:41,763
Why is his so blue?

785
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:45,330
It illustrates decreased
frontal brain activity,

786
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:47,869
resulting from atrophy
due to his injury.

787
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:49,894
So

788
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:53,767
would this explain
a previously meek,

789
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:56,903
gentle person
suddenly turning violent?

790
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:58,338
Absolutely.

791
00:32:58,514 --> 00:33:01,449
It disinhibits and,
in extreme cases,

792
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:05,279
renders one
virtually incapable
of controlling one's urges.

793
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:09,453
Dr. Shelton, are you saying
that everyone who suffers

794
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:11,686
a blow to the frontal Iobe
will kill?

795
00:33:11,761 --> 00:33:13,160
SHELTON: No, of course not.

796
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:15,690
There are numerous cases
in the history of brain...

797
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:16,789
CABOT: Thank you.

798
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:18,766
You've offered a very
provocative theory.

799
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:22,703
What it Iacks in substance
it makes up for
in pretty colors.

800
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:27,500
I've studied
the criminal brain
for the past 20 years.

801
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,837
The most vicious
were overwhelmingly

802
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:31,812
those with a combination
of abusive childhoods,

803
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:35,078
psychotic symptoms
and brain injuries.

804
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:38,946
How many people
participated in your study?

805
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:41,582
One hundred
and eighty-seven.

806
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:46,056
And how many people
suffer brain injuries
in a given year?

807
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:49,431
I don't have
the exact number.

808
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:51,694
The number is 500,000.

809
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:56,594
That's a half a million
predominately
Iaw-abiding citizens.

810
00:33:58,174 --> 00:34:01,234
Pretty much dwarfs
your Iittle study,
wouldn't you say?

811
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:05,077
My study included
some of your most
infamous serial killers,

812
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:08,139
including Bundy,
Dahmer, Shawcross,

813
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:10,447
Mark David Chapman,
Joel Rifkin...

814
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,215
CABOT: And now Jerry Dupree.

815
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:15,914
Thank you, Doctor.
No further questions.

816
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:20,926
MRS. KRUG: He was
the best Iittle boy.

817
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:23,226
Never gave me
any trouble.

818
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,362
Even when his father died,

819
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:30,565
or when his
stepfather Ieft us,
he stayed sweet.

820
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:33,305
He never fought,
he never cursed.

821
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:36,204
Was there a time
when that changed?

822
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:37,572
In January.

823
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:39,574
What happened then?

824
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:41,207
My bakery was robbed.

825
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:44,680
A crazed man came in,
waving a hammer.

826
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:47,346
He told me that
he would kill me

827
00:34:47,957 --> 00:34:50,448
if I didn't give him
all the money
in the register.

828
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:52,426
Now, was Jerry
present at this time?

829
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:54,929
No, no. The man
started yelling,

830
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:59,223
and that's when
Jerry heard him
all the way upstairs.

831
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:00,766
BERNARDO:
And what did he do?

832
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:02,202
He came to my rescue.

833
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:05,468
He tried to pull the weapon
from the man, but...

834
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:08,569
He got him,

835
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:11,311
right in the head.

836
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:13,641
Struck him in the head.

837
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:17,148
Your Honor, I'd Iike to
submit into evidence

838
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,211
Defense exhibits 21,

839
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:21,487
the police report
of the robbery,

840
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:24,754
and 22, hospital records
of Jerry's concussion.

841
00:35:24,927 --> 00:35:26,292
CORWIN: So entered.

842
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:31,360
Now, how Iong after this
did you notice a change
in Jerry's personality?

843
00:35:31,901 --> 00:35:35,268
Immediately. He had
headaches all the time.

844
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:39,773
He would burst
into fits of anger
at the Ieast Iittle thing.

845
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:42,037
And he started swearing.

846
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:44,808
And you are
absolutely positive

847
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:48,450
that this did not occur
until after the attack?

848
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:50,109
Yes.

849
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:55,685
My son is not the same person.
But that is not his fault.

850
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,687
The man who hurt him
should be on trial
for this murder,

851
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:01,252
not Jerry. He was...

852
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:04,565
He was protecting
his mother.

853
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:09,161
She has them believing
Jerry's a hero.

854
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:11,035
Well, the robbery case
is still open.

855
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:14,167
No Ieads on the perp.
But the mother did
file a report that day.

856
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:16,234
Brain injury's
Iegitimate, too.

857
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:19,042
But not as an excuse.
Just Iook at our victim.

858
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:22,414
Kunsong endured
every abuse imaginable,
and she never hurt a soul.

859
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:23,952
It is a pretty
sick irony.

860
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,011
She survives hell
only to meet Jerry.

861
00:36:26,322 --> 00:36:28,722
Who's apparently
a bit of a klutz.

862
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,315
CABOT: What do you mean?

863
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:34,227
Gina's expert concentrated
on the functional damage,
proving the injury,

864
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:36,697
but there's numerous
indications here
of structural damage.

865
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:38,757
Are you saying he's been
hit in the head before?

866
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:41,325
Repeatedly.
But not Iimited
to the frontal Iobe.

867
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:43,770
And from the Iooks
of some of these
healed Iesions,

868
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,636
over a Iong period of time.

869
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,368
It's funny, the mother
never mentioned these.

870
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:50,435
Probably because they weren't
from defending helpless women

871
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:51,502
and children.

872
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:53,740
Maybe the Iast one
wasn't, either.

873
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:57,147
Good mothers have been known
to make excuses for bad sons.

874
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:00,385
Find me evidence
she perjured herself.

875
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,050
MUNCH: How badly
was Jerry hurt?

876
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:07,027
When we found him,
his pupils weren't reactive.

877
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:08,290
He couldn't answer
basic questions,

878
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:09,922
and he drifted
in and out of
consciousness.

879
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,466
I take it the mother
was hysterical.

880
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:13,900
She insisted on riding along.
Wouldn't Ieave his side.

881
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,370
We had to physically
pull her away
just to check his vitals.

882
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,736
MUNCH: She tell you
what happened?

883
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:19,570
When we first got there,
the Iittle brother told us

884
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:21,610
he found him unconscious,
couldn't wake him up.

885
00:37:21,677 --> 00:37:22,905
Wait a minute.
Where was the mother?

886
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:25,209
Downstairs in the bakery.

887
00:37:25,514 --> 00:37:26,981
MUNCH: Wasn't
Jerry down there?

888
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:29,483
No. We responded
to the residence upstairs.

889
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:31,144
He was in his bedroom.

890
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:33,311
Why would my mom Iie?

891
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:34,651
To protect Jerry.

892
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:37,383
We figure she had
to do that a Iot.

893
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,518
No.

894
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:40,221
You know, if your mom's
making up stories,

895
00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:41,695
or if she knows of
other women he's hurt,

896
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:43,527
then she could go
to jail, too.

897
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,624
You don't want that,
now, do you?

898
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:52,304
Brendan, we know your mom
wants to protect Jerry
because she Ioves him.

899
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:55,032
But he's already
ruined enough Iives.

900
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:57,602
Don't Iet him hurt your mom
any more than he already has.

901
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,581
You don't even know her.
She's the one who hurt him.

902
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:03,418
Your mom hit Jerry
that night?

903
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:06,086
Yes.
STABLER: Why?

904
00:38:06,322 --> 00:38:07,880
Same reason as always.

905
00:38:07,957 --> 00:38:10,755
She caught him with
another pair of Iady's shoes.

906
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:14,958
First time she caught him,
he was five years old.

907
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:17,829
Has she been
hitting Jerry
ever since?

908
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:21,467
She blames Jerry
for our dad Ieaving us

909
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:23,129
since he was
such an embarrassment.

910
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:25,036
What did she hit him with
that night?

911
00:38:25,107 --> 00:38:27,098
The Iady's shoe
she caught him with.

912
00:38:27,176 --> 00:38:28,905
It had a big wooden heel.

913
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:32,078
Brendan, does your mom
ever hit you?

914
00:38:32,148 --> 00:38:35,083
Sometimes. But I'm a Iot
quicker than Jerry.

915
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:37,243
She's definitely
gonna whale on me

916
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,550
when she finds out
I told you all this.

917
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:42,523
You Ieave my mother
out of this.

918
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:44,115
Afraid that we can't
do that, Jerry.

919
00:38:44,193 --> 00:38:46,718
Not after the blow by blow
Brendan gave us.

920
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:49,463
Jerry, we can
plead you guilty
but not responsible,

921
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:51,159
but you have got
to work with us.

922
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:52,632
My mother
never hit me.

923
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:54,727
Why would your brother
say that?

924
00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:56,900
To protect me.

925
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:58,672
Like Dr. Sorenson,

926
00:38:59,308 --> 00:39:01,299
who treated you when
your mother put you
in the hospital?

927
00:39:01,377 --> 00:39:02,503
She didn't!

928
00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:07,080
He told your mother
that your head injury
was severe.

929
00:39:07,149 --> 00:39:08,946
That you had
to be careful.

930
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,143
No.

931
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,619
BENSON: That with
any further trauma,

932
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:14,883
the consequences
could be devastating.

933
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:19,893
Jerry, did she hit you
again after that?

934
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,697
I killed that girl.

935
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,033
I belong in prison.

936
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,831
You belong in a hospital.

937
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:31,938
You heard the expert.
They can't fix me.

938
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:36,106
If I get out,
I'II just do it again.

939
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:37,440
BENSON: Like your mom?

940
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:41,080
Tell me what's gonna happen
when Brendan does something

941
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,139
to piss her off.

942
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:44,814
JERRY: He won't.
No?

943
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:47,954
He's not Iike me.
He's normal.

944
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:53,558
Jerry, your mother's
used to taking out
her frustrations on somebody.

945
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,797
Now, who's that person
gonna be when you're
out of the house?

946
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:07,806
There was a girl
in the bakery.

947
00:40:08,844 --> 00:40:10,937
I started talking
about her shoes.

948
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:14,444
Right in front of Ma.

949
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:16,280
Okay. What happened?

950
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:22,580
She went crazy.
Came after me
with a frying pan.

951
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:28,262
I told her,
"Not my head, Ma."

952
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:32,328
It just made her madder.

953
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,434
She caught me
on the side of my head,

954
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:38,437
knocked me down,

955
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,138
kept hitting.

956
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,177
I begged her to stop.

957
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:49,573
"Ma, please, remember
what the doctor said."

958
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:55,315
She grabbed the handle
with both hands,

959
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,024
brought it down
as hard as she could.

960
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,227
That's the Iast thing
that I remember.

961
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,604
Here you go.
Enjoy, huh?

962
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:21,149
Enjoy it to go.
The rest of you might want
to find another bakery.

963
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:23,082
What are you doing?
PIacing you under arrest.

964
00:41:23,152 --> 00:41:24,176
What for?

965
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:25,777
BENSON: The murder
of Kunsong Bennett.

966
00:41:25,855 --> 00:41:28,517
Oh, that's insane.
I had nothing
to do with that.

967
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:29,615
Yeah, you did.

968
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:31,683
You caused the injuries that
turned Jerry into a killer.

969
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,921
What?
That's depraved indifference.

970
00:41:33,996 --> 00:41:35,020
Murder two.

971
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:36,655
I didn't make him
the way that he is.

972
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:38,131
There's always something
wrong with him.

973
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,895
I did everything
I could to fix it.

974
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,027
With blows to the head?

975
00:41:41,103 --> 00:41:42,593
Nothing else worked!

976
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:44,972
You don't know what
he put me through!

977
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,234
Oh, don't Iook at me
Iike that.

978
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:48,401
I am not the one
that's sick.

979
00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:50,672
You know me.

980
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:52,244
You know that
I'm a good mother.

981
00:41:52,314 --> 00:41:54,282
You tell them that
I'm a good mother!

982
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,510
Tell them!
