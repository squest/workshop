NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:04,731
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,966
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:08,976
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:12,571
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,342
These are their stories.

What in the hell
were you thinking?

9
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:18,814
You said to invite people.

10
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:21,253
I said, "Bring a friend,"
not 25 slobs.

11
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:22,517
You're out of cold beer.

12
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:23,751
Guess you should
go home, then.

13
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,588
You've got a phone call.
Whoever it is, I'm busy.

14
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,959
It's your neighbor.
It's something about
music and the cops.

15
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:32,033
Mrs. Grenis.
I'm turning it down.

Believe me, I'd Iove
for these parasites to Ieave.

(GLASS SHATTERING)
Okay. Oh, my God.

18
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:41,274
What are you doing
to my house?

19
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,749
Open the door.
Open the damn door!

20
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:54,187
What the hell happened?

21
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:55,416
He tried to rape me.

22
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:01,221
Rape victim's
a Cheryl Avery, 19.

23
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:03,093
Medic's checking her
out on the bus.

on the head with a vase.

Where is the
alleged attacker?

27
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,337
Oh, he's on way to Cabrini.
His name's a Joe Cappilla.

28
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:15,637
Miss Avery claims
he tried to rape her.

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,076
Well, it sounds Iike
you think she made it up.

30
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,307
Well, her blouse is torn
and her face was bruised,

31
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:22,907
but she refuses to go to
the ER to get checked out.

32
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:26,249
She was violated.
Doesn't want to be poked at.

33

Detective Benson, SVU.
Where's your patient?

34
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,616
In back.
No, she's not.

35
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:33,752
She was here a minute ago.

36
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:37,922
Must've bailed.

37
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:42,100
Son of a bitch.

38
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,349
Looks Iike they struggled.
See these black scuff marks?

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,823
Perp was wearing sneakers,
so these probably came
from Cheryl Avery's heels.

40
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:40,259
He shoved her backwards
into the window,
the glass broke,

41
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:43,354
she grabbed the vase
and whacked him with it.

42
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:45,991
Went down and banged
his head on the tub.

43
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,431
FIN: Find Cheryl yet?
Nope.

44
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:50,733
And neither did the sector car
I sent to her house.

45
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,864
The address she gave
the uniform is phony.

46
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,068
I wouldn't be surprised
if her name is, too.

47
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:58,010
Well, this was a party.
Somebody had to invite her.

48
00:02:58,113 --> 00:03:00,673
I invited five friends over
for pizza and beer.

49
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:02,649
That Joe and Cheryl, they
weren't even on the Iist.

50
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:05,515
BENSON: Do you know them?
No. I don't hang out
with rapists.

51
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:08,385
And the first time
I saw Cheryl was in
my bathroom bleeding.

52
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,616
So who invited them?

53
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,558
(SIGHS) Name's Ricky.
Freaking social director.

54
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:17,787
Ricky, what can you
tell us about Joe?

55
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,994
Met him at a club.

56
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,037
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Thought he was cute
till he showed up high

57
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:25,231
and started hitting on
every girl in the room.

58
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:26,467
Joe hit on Cheryl?

59
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,769
Didn't see it,

60
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,810
but maybe that's why
he was fighting
with his brother.

61
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,539
Joe's brother was here?
Yeah.

62
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:34,047
Name's Eddie.
Cheryl's his girlfriend.

63
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,810
You have any idea
where Eddie Iives?

64
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:39,047
With Joe and their mom,
23rd and 9th.

65

Hospital.

66
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:42,287
Joe going to be okay?

67
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,914
No, Joe's dead.

68
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,593
My mom called
from the hospital

69
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,859
and told me everything, so...

70
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,594
We're so sorry
for your Ioss.

71
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:58,363
Eddie, we need to find out
what happened at that party.

72
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,874
My brother tried
to rape my girlfriend.

73
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:06,112
That's what the hospital
told my mom.

74
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:07,910
What did you see?

75
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,414
I Ieft early.

76
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,453
How come?

77
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,852
I started having
palpitations.

78
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:16,982
From fighting
with your brother?

79
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:20,050
Yeah. I got
a heart condition,

80
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:24,428
so I came home
to take my medicine.

81
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,990
BENSON: You didn't take
Cheryl with you?

82
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:28,433
I told her to stay.

83
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:31,734
She was dancing,
having a good time...

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,935
Bum Ieg keep you
from dancing with her?

85
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,503
Yeah, I sprained my ankle
playing hoops.

86
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:42,541
I know, with a heart
condition, it's stupid.

87
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,641
Eddie,

88
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,050
why were you and
your brother fighting?

89
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:50,649
He's a punk.
He treated women Iike dirt.

90
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:53,392
He ever get rough?

91
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:56,862
Yeah, when he got high,
which was all the time.

92
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,490
That's what we were
fighting about.

93
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,697
Cheryl is the nicest girl
I ever met.

94
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:08,937
She wouldn't hit Joe
unless he provoked her.

95
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,946
I mean, if she says it was
self-defense, then it was.

96
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,481
She ran away.

97
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,313
That Iooks real bad.

98
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,217
You want to help her?

99
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,619
Tell us where she is.

100
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,556
I wanted to tell Eddie
what happened,

101
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:27,254
but I didn't think
he'd understand.

102
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,763
BENSON: We're having
a hard time ourselves, Cheryl.

103
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,890
Why did you Ieave
the ambulance?

104
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,967
I thought you
wouldn't believe me.

105
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,435
It would be Joe's word
against mine.

106
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,200
AII we've got is your word.
Joe's dead.

107
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,633
Oh, my God.

108
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,307
Oh, my God.

109
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,049
I didn't...

110
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,318
I didn't mean to kill him.

111
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:54,588
Cheryl, tell us
what happened.

112
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:55,714
Will I go to jail?

113
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,623
Not if he attacked you,
it's self-defense.

114
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:00,555
Oh, God.

115
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:02,521
I...

116
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,862
I went to the bathroom
and Joe followed me in.

117
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,730
I tried to be nice to him
for Eddie's sake, but,

118
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,366
God, he's so disgusting.

119
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,966
He's constantly
putting Eddie down.

120
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,606
And I told him to get out,
but he wouldn't Ieave.

121
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,670
Did he touch you?

122
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:23,274
He put his hands on my...
On my breasts.

123
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:27,317
I tried to yell for help
but the music was too Ioud.

124
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:30,152
Then he ripped my shirt

125
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,055
and he punched me in the face.

126
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:38,058
And I grabbed something
and I hit him,
but he fought back.

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,360
So I pushed him off me,

128
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:46,235
and that's when he fell
and hit the tub.

129
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,671
So are you going to indict
Cheryl or give her a pass?

130
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,609
No, I'm in no hurry
to convene a grand jury.

131
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,876
The crime Iab confirmed
Cheryl's account,
it's justifiable homicide.

132
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:55,973
What else have we got?

133
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,382
Tox-screen on Joe.
Positive for crystal meth.

134
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:00,683
That explains his
pugnacious personality.

135
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,586
Yeah, still here.
Those bruises are real, AIex.

136
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,648
He definitely hit her.
Does Cheryl have any priors?

137
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:07,991
She's clean. But Joe isn't.
26 has a sexual
assault complaint

138
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,053
filed by a Paige Salinsky.

139
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,189
Was Joe arrested?

140
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,893
MUNCH: Miss Salinsky
dropped the charges.

141
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,628
So Joe has a habit
of getting high,

142
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,829
abusing women,
and his own brother
thinks he's a hump.

143
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,430
Well, don't forget
his brother just happens
to be the victim's boyfriend.

144
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,667
Joe's the only one
who can't speak.

145
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:22,676
Maybe his wounds still can.

146
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:25,804
If Joe did attack Cheryl,
he may have injuries
to show for it.

147
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,781
Check with EMS
and the medical examiner.

148
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,615
Yeah, I remember.
Got him stabilized
halfway to the hospital

149
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,247
when he seized,
went into cardiac arrest.

150
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:36,483
DOA.

151
00:07:36,558 --> 00:07:39,686
Doc told us Iater that
the blows to the head caused
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

152
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:42,252
Well, did you notice
any other injuries?

153
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,991
Scratches, swelling?

154
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:46,533
Three knuckles
on his right hand
were cut up.

155
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,262
Bruise on Cheryl's face
was on the Ieft side.

156
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,633
So he punches her
with his right,

157
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,171
he cuts his hand
on her teeth.

158
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,900
Hey, you remember
anything else?

159
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,942
Before the seizure,
the guy was rambling.

160
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:55,998
Any of it make sense?

161
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:57,510
You tell me.

162
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:02,514
"Get Eddie, get Eddie.
He did it, he did it."

163
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:03,744
Are you sure that
he said Eddie?

164
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,548
Anything the patient says,
I write down.

165
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,613
Sounds Iike Cheryl
didn't tell us everything.

166
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:13,483
VERONICA: May I help you?

167
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:14,585
BENSON: Yeah,
we're Iooking for Cheryl.

168
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:17,256
In back. She's got company.

169
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,668
BENSON: Looks Iike
we're interrupting.

170
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:30,734
STABLER: Guess they had to
get their stories straight.

171
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,003
What do you mean?

172
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,071
Stop screwing us around,
the both of you.

173
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,479
Look, I told you
what happened.

174
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,347
BENSON: Yeah, you Ieft out
a few details.

175
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,442
Like what?

176
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,317
That bathroom window
was broken out.

177
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:43,380
It's a fifteen foot
drop to the ground.

178
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,789
How'd you really
sprain your ankle?

179
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,952
Wait, Eddie had
nothing to do with this.

180
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,019
STABLER: That's not
what Joe said.

181
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:50,757
What are you talking about?

182
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:53,494
In the ambulance,
before he died.

183
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,798
He said, "He did it.
Get Eddie."

184
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:03,807
Joe tried to rape me.
I hit him, he fell and
he banged his head.

185
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:07,041
Cheryl, you're hindering
a murder investigation.

186
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:09,242
Now, Joe said
that Eddie did it.

187
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,046
And I understand
that you're trying to

188
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,347
protect him.
Eddie went home.

189
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,409
We know that.

190
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:16,980
But we have witnesses that
saw Eddie and Joe fighting,
and then Eddie Ieft.

191
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,582
But he came back,
didn't he?

192
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,821
No. No.

193
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,387
If Joe was attacking you
and Eddie

194
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:25,364
walked in and came
to your defense,

195
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:27,401
then Joe's death
is an accident.

196
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:29,299
You tried to stop him,
it got out of hand.

197
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,803
You didn't mean
to kill anybody.

198
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:32,396
That's not what happened.

199
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,770
Eddie, no one's
gonna put you away

200
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,365
for protecting
your girlfriend.

201
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:37,968
I swear I never
touched Joe.

202
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:43,048
Oh, Eddie.

203
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:47,083
Okay, Eddie. Okay,
so I've got this all wrong.

204
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:49,783
Maybe Joe didn't try
to rape Cheryl, huh?

205
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:50,983
Of course he did.

206
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,993
No, you know
what I'm thinking?

207
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,585
You caught Joe and
Cheryl getting it on

208
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,653
behind your back
in that bathroom.
No.

209
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,723
No, no.
The betrayal,
the blind rage...

210
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,301
Cheryl Ioves me.

211
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:03,337
BENSON: Were you
making out with Joe?

212
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:06,271
Oh, my God, I would...
No, I would never
do that to Eddie.

213
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:10,402
Of course you didn't mean to,
but Eddie Ieft you alone
at a party with Joe,

214
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:11,775
so he starts making
the moves on you,

215
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,006
you got caught up
in the moment.

216
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,275
Wait, wait. No, no, no.

217
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:15,907
So you didn't want
Eddie to know...
You're wrong...

218
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:19,112
So when he walked in,
you said that Joe
was raping you.

219
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:21,485
And he responded Iike
any good boyfriend would.

220
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:22,545
STABLER: You hit Joe.

221
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,387
No, I didn't.
You went back to the party

222
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:25,551
to bring Cheryl home.
Don't do this.

223
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:26,753
You find her
in the bathroom...
What?

224
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:28,591
...with your brother's
hands all over her.

225
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:31,689
Come on, Eddie, be a man.
Don't Iet your girlfriend
go down

226
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:34,166
for something
you did.
Okay!

227
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:38,467
I was in the room.
I was there.

228
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,631
Just tell me what happened.

229
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,675
He was being a prick

230
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:46,043
to some of the girls
at the party.
And I told him, "Stop."

231
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:49,482
He got pissed,
gave me a shove,

232
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,142
then I Ieft.
We know,

233
00:10:51,219 --> 00:10:53,653
to go home and get your pills.
We've been through that!

234
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:55,322
Why are you telling me that?

235
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,756
I want to know,
why did you come back?

236
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,988
I felt bad 'cause
I Ieft Cheryl there.

237
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:03,326
Joe was already
on the floor

238
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:05,662
when I walked
into that bathroom.

239
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:09,698
Cheryl Iocked the door,
said Joe tried to rape her,

240
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:11,530
just Iike she told you.

241
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:12,732
So you didn't see anything.

242
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,468
That's awful convenient.
Why would you jump
out the window?

243
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,102
She said people
would think I did it

244
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:20,170
'cause they saw Joe
and me fighting earlier.

245
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:21,642
(GROANING)

246
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:24,947
Cheryl was only trying
to protect me.

247
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,156
Eddie says he was
in the bathroom,

248
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:36,196
Cheryl says he wasn't.
I can't tell who's
covering for whom.

249
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:38,960
Eddie fought with his brother
in front of a dozen witnesses.

250
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,058
His brother winds up dead.

251
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,932
What if the rape itself
is the Iie?

252
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:45,272
Do you think Cheryl made
the whole thing up?

253
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,863
To cover for Eddie.

254
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:49,239
He kills Joe in the bathroom,
Cheryl walks in,

255
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,504
tells Eddie to go
out the window,

256
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:52,307
she'II say Joe was
trying to rape her.

257
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,905
Well, then they're
co-conspirators. And
I can't use anything

258
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,540
either one of them
says against the other

259
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,209
without independent
corroboration.

260
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:01,551
We canvassed
everyone at the party.
Nobody saw anything.

261
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:04,989
Let's see whose story the
physical evidence supports.

262
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,627
We're not done with
the reconstruction yet,
but I can tell you

263
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,188
that everyone's prints
are in that bathroom.

264
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,494
Eddie admits
he was there.

265
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:14,557
There's no surprise.

266
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,468
This will be.
This is Joe's shirt.

267
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,438
The blood on it
only belongs to him.

268
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,565
This is Cheryl's.

269
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:22,302
Two different blood types,
both male.

270
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,934
One matches Joe,
the other's unknown.

271
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,603
So it's gotta be Eddie's.
It's not.

272
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,844
Y-chromosomes from the DNA
say the samples come
from two unrelated males.

273
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:32,782
So now we got another guy
in that bathroom with Joe,
Eddie and Cheryl?

274
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:35,584
That's what I thought
until I tested this.

275
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:36,748
STABLER: You get that
out of the bathroom?

276
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,257
No. From EMS.

277
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:39,918
Medics used it to wrap
Cheryl's bloody hand,

278
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:41,552
then we collected it
for evidence.

279
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,655
It's called a control sample
because the only blood on it
is Cheryl's.

280
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,324
Well, what's that
gonna tell us?

281
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,560
I compared the blood
on the bandage

282
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:50,229
to our unknown male.
It was a match.

283
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:58,277
Cheryl's a man?

284
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,937
What in the hell
are we dealing with?

285
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:02,949
Probably a pre-op
transsexual.

286
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:04,211
STABLER: If she's still
got her package,

287
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,446
it explains why she didn't
go to the hospital
to be examined.

288
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,513
I've seen
plenty of trannies,
but she is amazing.

289
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,217
She's gotta be
taking hormones.

290
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,487
Boys with breasts get
more money on the street.

291
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:16,291
I don't make her for a pro.
She's got a straight job.

292
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:18,264
Probably saving up enough
money for the surgery.

293
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,890
Well, none of this
changes the fact

294
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,264
that Joe still
tried to rape her.

295
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,700
She's got the bruises
to show for it.

296
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,330
Maybe he got violent
when he discovered
her secret.

297
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:27,397
Or Joe threatened
to tell Eddie,

298
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,067
giving Cheryl motive
to kill him.

299
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,235
STABLER: Eddie's gotta know.

300
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,438
He and Cheryl have
been going out for
a couple of months now.

301
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:34,276
They were all over each other
when we picked them up.

302
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,839
So they're both covering up
Cheryl's secret.

303
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,613
Who do you think
we should try to break first?

304
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:40,847
Cheryl's pulling
all the strings,
telling Eddie what to say.

305
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:43,322
My guess is he's
the weaker Iink.

306
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:50,162
Eddie, I know you've
been through a Iot.

307
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:53,898
I don't want to
make things worse.

308
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:55,060
What do you mean?

309
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:57,161
I'm not here to judge you.

310
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:58,398
You know that, right?

311
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,406
I just want to find out what
happened in that bathroom.

312
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,772
I already told you.

313
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,346
I walked into the bathroom.

314
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:11,609
Joe was on the floor.
Cheryl was beat up.

315
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:15,215
You didn't tell us
about Cheryl, though.

316
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:17,384
What about her?

317
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:25,260
What you do
in your private Iife
is your business.

318
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,528
You gotta start
being honest with me.

319
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:33,602
I am being honest. What?

320
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:37,440
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

321
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:44,080
I'm talking about
Cheryl being a man.

322
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:49,378
(SCOFFS)

323
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:56,354
What kind of
sick joke is this?

324
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,461
I'm sorry you had to
find out this way.

325
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:03,594
You're crazy.

326
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:04,763
(CHUCKLES)

327
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,071
I have... I've seen her...
I've seen her breasts.

328
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,303
Female hormones.

329
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:15,104
They can do that.
Look, Eddie,
she had us all fooled.

330
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,583
We did a blood test.

331
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:21,582
(YELLING)

332
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,822
(GRUNTS) What are you
saying to me?

333
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:29,786
I held her! I kissed her.

334
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,966
I wanted to spend my Iife
with her. What are you...

335
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,176
She wouldn't have sex.

336
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:47,646
She said she wanted to wait.

337
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:51,515
She would just
push my hands away.

338
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,522
Oh, God. I need to see her,

339
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,753
I need to see her.
I want to talk to her.
Eddie.

340
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:05,165
Eddie!
Don't.

341
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:12,198
What's wrong with you?

342
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:14,799
Why are you Iooking
at me Iike that?

343
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,771
Say something.

344
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:21,641
Oh, oh!

345
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:29,147
You are a freak!
No!

346
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:32,751
STABLER: Eddie, get off.
Eddie. Eddie.

347
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,289
Okay?

348
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:38,865
Look, I was gonna tell you.

349
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:39,958
When?

350
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:41,900
After I had the surgery.

351
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,938
Oh, you make me sick.

352
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:48,073
Oh, God.

353
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:52,012
Why did you do this? Why?

354
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:57,751
Cheryl, stand up, come on.
It's okay. Come on, come on.

355
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:03,250
We thought that Eddie knew.

356
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:05,054
We thought that
he was protecting you.

357
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:10,227
How Iong did you think
that you could keep
this a secret?

358
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:14,359
I just thought if I could
make him Iove me enough,
he'd understand.

359
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:18,566
Okay, well, Iet's sit down.
Come on. Come on, sit down.

360
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,747
But you were also afraid
that he wouldn't understand.

361
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:32,980
For the first time in my Iife,
I had someone who Ioves me.

362
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:39,322
And if Joe was to tell Eddie,
that would be over.

363
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:42,091
My Iife would be over.

364
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:43,791
So what happened?

365
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,531
Joe was walking
out of the bathroom,

366
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:51,970
so I picked up the vase
and I hit him.

367
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,537
And then Eddie walked in.

368
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,372
I never meant to kill Joe.

369
00:17:57,546 --> 00:18:00,014
I just didn't
want him to talk.

370
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,587
You'II have to tell Eddie
that I didn't mean to do it.

371
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:11,624
I mean, please make him
understand that.

372
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:17,324
You okay?

373
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:19,924
Oh, I'II never be okay.

374
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:24,838
This wasn't your fault.

375
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,464
Yeah, it was.

376
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:31,976
My brother's dead because
my girlfriend's a guy.

377
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,239
I should've...

378
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:36,909
No one knew.

379
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:45,350
What if I did know,
deep down?

380
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:54,197
You were in Iove with a woman.

381
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,768
That's what you knew.

382
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,636
You sure you're
okay? Huh?
Yeah.

383
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:04,702
I need some air.

384
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:05,837
Whoa!

385
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:09,340
I need some help in here!

386
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:13,249
What happened?
He just collapsed.

387
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,447
He's got a heart condition.

388
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:16,582
Call an ambulance.
Hardly has any pulse.

389
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:17,920
STABLER: This is empty.

390
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:19,654
Digoxin.
It's stopping his heart.

391
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:21,491
We got a drug overdose.

392
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:24,890
I'm Iosing his pulse.
You better start CPR.

393
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,795
Eddie!

394
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,199
Come on, Eddie!

395
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,302
Come on, Eddie!

396
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,375
He was pulseless
for ten minutes.

397
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,574
I pronounced him
at 1815.

398
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,708
You got
the pill vial?

399
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:43,944
Yeah, it's right here.

400
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:47,079
I'II do the autopsy,
I'II get you the results
quick as I can,

401
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,282
but doesn't Iook to me
Iike anything
other than a suicide.

402
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:52,121
It's a death in custody,
suicide or not.

403
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:53,354
You guys from
Internal Affairs

404
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:55,396
are Iike sharks smelling
blood a mile away.

405
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:56,555
Save it, Captain.

406
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:56,859
I got an investigation
to conduct.

407
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:59,401
You think we forced the pills
down his throat?

408
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:00,833
TUCKER: No, but you
Ieft a Iethal dose

409
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:04,498
of pharmaceuticals
in possession of
a distraught suspect.

410
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,538
Talk to me
through my delegate.

411
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:10,238
That distraught suspect
needed those pills
for a heart condition.

412
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:12,781
That still doesn't mitigate
your failure to supervise

413
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:14,543
Detective Stabler
and Agent Huang.

414
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:17,484
IAB doesn't have
jurisdiction
over Doctor Huang.

415
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:21,683
We'II refer his conduct
to the FBI's Office of
Professional Responsibility.

416
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:25,215
I hope your
med-mal insurance
is paid up, Doc.

417
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:33,702
COURT OFFICER: AII rise.
The Honorable
Judge Seligman presiding.

418
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:34,895
CLERK: Now in session.

419
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:38,964
Docket ending 5971,
"People v. Cheryl Avery.

420
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,703
"One count, murder
in the second degree."

421
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:43,711
Morton Berger
for the defense, Your Honor.

422
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:46,475
We all know
who you are, Mr. Berger.

423
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,948
How does your client plead?

424
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,507
Not guilty.

425
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:50,574
SELIGMAN: Ms. Cabot?

426
00:20:50,653 --> 00:20:52,245
Uh... Remand.

427
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,617
My client is not
a threat to the community.

428
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,022
She has no prior
criminal record, Your Honor.

429
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:59,118
And you can't hold
a press conference
in a Iock-up.

430
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:00,287
She's out of Iine,
Your Honor.

431
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:02,092
Oh, come on, Morty.
You wouldn't have
taken this case

432
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:04,689
if you didn't smell
the publicity.

433
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,565
Bail is set at $200,000.

434
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:10,037
Mr. Berger, are you going with
an insanity defense?

435
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:14,008
Absolutely not.
This case is entirely about
society's prejudice...

436
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:17,637
REPORTER 1:
Ms. Cabot, Ms. Cabot,
a few questions, please.

437
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:19,806
Ms. Cabot, hold on.
The D.A.'s office
will try this case

438
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:22,009
in the courtroom,
not the press. Thank you.

439
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,346
REPORTER 2: Come on,
Ms. Cabot, give us a break.

440
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:24,784
REPORTER 3: Come on,
just help us out here.

441
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:26,754
Just something, huh?
Come on.

442
00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:29,450
Don't want your 15
minutes of fame, AIex?

443
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,652
I hear you paid
Cheryl's bail.
That's a nice touch.

444
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:34,525
Can't take the full credit.
That was the generosity
of my firm.

445
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:36,360
Well, Cheryl makes
a Iovely poster child,

446
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:38,161
so I'm guessing you're
doing this pro bono.

447
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,498
And you work
for a pittance,
so we're even.

448
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,127
You're wasting your time.

449
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:44,365
The judge is never
going to suppress
Cheryl's confession.

450
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,532
Good.

451
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:49,339
I need it to support
my argument that she
acted in self-defense.

452
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:52,074
Joe Cappilla was
Ieaving the bathroom.
The threat had abated.

453
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:53,615
Her Iife was
no Ionger in danger.

454
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:56,675
Yeah, until Joe told
the waiting Iynch mob
she was transsexual.

455
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:59,312
Predictions of violence
are notoriously unreliable.

456
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:01,253
Nobody can say what
Joe might have done.

457
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:02,348
Come on.

458
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:07,025
We both know what people do
when they find out the truth
about the trans-gendered.

459
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:08,959
They kill them.

460
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,731
Now, Cheryl's not responsible
for beating Joe to death

461
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:15,202
because she's trans-gendered.
Well, that's an excuse.

462
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:17,239
It is, and it works.
You think
she's gonna walk?

463
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:21,402
I doubt it. The irony is
Berger's argument may
actually work for our case.

464
00:22:21,477 --> 00:22:24,037
People are generally hostile
towards the trans-gendered.

465
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,171
So a jury will be, too.

466
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:28,842
Berger's gonna put witnesses
up there for Cheryl,
or whatever his name is,

467
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:31,682
to tell us all about
how he grew up
tormented, brutalized,

468
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:32,982
and treated Iike a freak.

469
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:35,387
You know, it sounds Iike you
have a problem with Cheryl.

470
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,518
My problem is this he-she
and her Iies are the reason

471
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:39,822
we've got two dead bodies
on our hands,

472
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:41,294
and I'm the one
who's all jammed up?

473
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:43,195
Look, I need background
on Cheryl now.

474
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:45,358
AII we know so far is that

475
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:47,265
she changed her name when
she was 18 years old.

476
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:49,361
She used to be called
Charles Avery.

477
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:50,996
Her parents still Iive
in AIphabet City.

478
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:52,233
Then why don't you
go talk to them?

479
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:54,037
Maybe they can undercut
Cheryl's abuse story.

480
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,237
I don't know, AIex.
I talked to her.

481
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:57,677
And unless she's
a damned good actor,

482
00:22:57,747 --> 00:22:59,271
she is completely
in Iove with Eddie

483
00:22:59,348 --> 00:23:00,474
and was afraid
of Iosing him.

484
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:01,846
So she kills
Eddie's brother?

485
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,646
True Iove doesn't
mitigate murder.

486
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,914
I don't think
she's a violent person.

487
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:07,785
That's fine. Prove it.

488
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:15,697
Charlie was 16
when he started
growing breasts.

489
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,596
Stole the hormones his mother
was taking for menopause.

490
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,655
We couldn't take it anymore.

491
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:19,826
Is that when she Ieft?

492
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:20,891
JOHN: We threw him out.

493
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,267
You think we're cruel,
Detective,

494
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:24,238
but we'd already
Iost our son.

495
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:26,638
There was nothing else
we could do.

496
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:27,698
What about therapy?

497
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:29,108
Charlie refused to go.

498
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:31,476
He insisted that inside
he felt Iike a woman,

499
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:33,811
and nothing was
gonna change that.

500
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:35,544
God doesn't make mistakes.

501
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:37,245
We've got two younger sons
and a daughter.

502
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,288
Now, how could we explain
Charlie waxing his Iegs
and wearing makeup?

503
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:42,256
Mom?
Sarah, honey,
go to the kitchen.

504
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:43,757
We'II be done soon.

505
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:44,884
Okay.

506
00:23:48,864 --> 00:23:50,923
How did Cheryl get along
with her siblings?

507
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,194
They stopped hanging
around with him

508
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:54,259
because they were getting
teased at school.

509
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:56,702
Well, how did Cheryl
do in school? Did she
ever have any fights...

510
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:58,205
Charlie!

511
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:00,570
His name is Charlie.

512
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:06,444
Was he ever violent,
Mr. Avery?

513
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:11,914
He beat a kid
with a baseball bat.
Put him in the hospital.

514
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,284
That violent enough?

515
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,195
Detective?

516
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:24,488
Sarah, right?

517
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,838
My parents are wrong.

518
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:38,209
You still talk to Cheryl?

519
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,647
Yes, but if my parents knew,
they'd kick me out, too.

520
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:46,176
Your parents said that
Cheryl once beat somebody
with a baseball bat.

521
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:48,450
She cut through the field
one day after school.

522
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:50,048
The baseball team
saw her and chased her.

523
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,252
She had to grab a bat
to defend herself.

524
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,556
This kind of thing
happen a Iot?

525
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:57,156
AII the time, I mean,
kids made fun of her
Iike she was a big joke.

526
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:58,962
Anybody ever hurt
her physically?

527
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,433
They beat
the hell out of her
whenever they could.

528
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:04,064
I mean, she had to
go to the hospital
three times for stitches.

529
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,538
I don't care
what anybody says,

530
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:08,099
she's the bravest
person I know.

531
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:10,675
I talked to her teachers.

532
00:25:10,746 --> 00:25:13,909
A sympathetic one
suggested that she
transfer to Harvey Milk,

533
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:15,245
an alternative
public school

534
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:16,909
for gay and
trans-gendered kids.

535
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:18,044
So why didn't she go?

536
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,747
Because her parents
wouldn't Iet her.

537
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:21,084
Where are you
going with this?

538
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:23,750
AII I need to know
is whether or not
Cheryl's been violent.

539
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:26,226
Only in self-defense.

540
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:28,820
One time, two boys
held her up against

541
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:30,422
a wall and pulled
her pants down.

542
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:32,899
AIex, this girl has
been through hell.

543
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:35,334
I know she's been a victim
and I know she's suffered.

544
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:37,838
But that doesn't give Cheryl
the right to kill Joe Cappilla

545
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:39,033
for threatening
to expose her.

546
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:40,871
Then at Ieast
offer her a plea.

547
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:43,070
Not until I know her intent.

548
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:46,310
If Berger will agree
to a psych evaluation,

549
00:25:46,382 --> 00:25:49,249
I'II have Huang
talk to Cheryl.

550
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:52,378
Yeah, when I was seven,
I knew I was different.

551
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:55,949
I mean,
every night I'd go to bed
dreaming about being a girl.

552
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:57,653
Well, how did
you handle that?

553
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:59,058
Forced myself to be a boy.

554
00:26:00,397 --> 00:26:02,228
That must have been difficult.

555
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,292
Yeah, I played with GI Joes
when I wanted to
dress up Barbies.

556
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:11,503
When was the first time that
you tried to become a woman?
Can you remember?

557
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:14,066
Yeah, I was ten.

558
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,636
And my father caught me
putting on my mother's makeup.

559
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:20,039
And what did he do?

560
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:23,847
Well, he beat
the crap out of me and
he called me a pervert.

561
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:28,049
Did that change
your feelings any?

562
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:29,284
No.

563
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,025
It's not something
you can change.

564
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:36,860
I mean, it's... It's me.
It's how I feel.

565
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,492
And I can't be anything else,

566
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,162
but I wanted to be
a whole woman.

567
00:26:42,706 --> 00:26:43,695
Sure.

568
00:26:44,074 --> 00:26:47,908
And I needed the surgery.
Especially after I met Eddie.

569
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:49,601
Eddie.

570
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:51,937
Had you ever considered
telling him?

571
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:53,880
No, no.

572
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:57,119
I figured I'd Iose him.

573
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:02,418
I mean, Eddie was
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

574
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:05,893
I mean, he was the first man
that Ioved me as a woman.

575
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,627
And I figured
if I had the surgery,
I wouldn't have to tell him.

576
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,725
But Joe was gonna
tell him, right?

577
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:14,463
How did that make you feel?

578
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,139
I saw fists punching me
Iike all those times before.

579
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:22,735
Any time Cheryl's
been violent,

580
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:24,643
it's been in response
to a perceived threat.

581
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:26,909
Joe had stopped the attack
and was Ieaving the bathroom.

582
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,780
The threat was over.
Not in her mind.

583
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:30,513
She feared what those
drunken party-goers

584
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:32,020
would do to her when
she Ieft that bathroom.

585
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:33,680
Boy, you'd make a great
witness for the defense.

586
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,850
I'm just calling it
Iike I see it, AIex.

587
00:27:35,925 --> 00:27:38,826
I don't think she
intended to kill Joe.

588
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:40,021
AII right.

589
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:42,926
If you're convinced,
I'II drop it to man one.

590
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:48,070
I told Cheryl
about your offer,

591
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:50,299
but she wants
to go to trial.

592
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:52,568
She does, or you do?

593
00:27:53,543 --> 00:27:55,943
Do you know why
I became a Iawyer, AIex?

594
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:58,510
To see your face on TV?

595
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:02,781
To change society's
misconceptions
about what's normal.

596
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,150
I'm here for the underdog.

597
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:07,519
You're here for yourself.

598
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,818
No, I'm here for a cause.

599
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:10,757
Gender is not always binary.

600
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:12,692
People are afraid
of what they don't know.

601
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:13,990
Cheryl's case can change that.

602
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:15,190
Are you so sure of this

603
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:18,132
that you're willing to
serve up your client
as the sacrificial Iamb?

604
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:20,465
She could spend the rest
of her Iife in prison.

605
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:23,267
Not after this is tried in
the court of public opinion.

606
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:28,038
Joe Cappilla sexually
assaulted Cheryl Avery
and threatened to out her.

607
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:30,136
She fought back
to save her Iife.

608
00:28:32,015 --> 00:28:33,448
She's not going to prison.

609
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:41,946
Hello.

610
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:44,384
Thanks for meeting me.

611
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:47,223
Well, I shouldn't be
speaking to you
without my attorney.

612
00:28:47,297 --> 00:28:49,288
I shouldn't be
asking you to,

613
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:52,994
but I'm very concerned
about how Mr. Berger
is handling your case.

614
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:56,500
You're the one prosecuting me.
Why would you care?

615
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:59,701
Because I think you're
getting bad advice.

616
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,902
No, he's...

617
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:03,912
No, he's the only one
who's been on my side.

618
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,004
He knows what
I've been through.

619
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:06,105
Then he should be
the first one

620
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:09,310
to tell you that your chances
of acquittal are slim to none.

621
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:12,320
I was attacked
and almost raped, okay?

622
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:14,413
He says a jury
will take my side.

623
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,823
I think a jury is going
to have some trouble

624
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:20,090
separating the facts of
the case from who you are.

625
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:23,864
Well, if you're so sure
I'm going to Iose,
then why are you here?

626
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:27,198
Because I want to know
why you won't take the deal.

627
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:29,998
What deal?

628
00:29:32,575 --> 00:29:36,238
I told Berger
I would plead down to
first-degree manslaughter.

629
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:39,174
He never told me.

630
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:43,677
You had no right to speak
to my client without me.

631
00:29:43,753 --> 00:29:45,118
I'm taking this
to Judge Larsen

632
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:46,382
and the disciplinary
committee.

633
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:47,650
Go ahead.
They'II Iove the part

634
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:48,952
where you ignored
your obligation

635
00:29:49,025 --> 00:29:50,287
to bring my deal
to your client

636
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,294
and then Iied to me
and told me you had.

637
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:56,025
I've done hundreds of trials
and made new case Iaw.

638
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,930
I think I know what's
best for my client.

639
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:59,434
Doesn't Cheryl have
a right to decide?

640
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:00,526
Fine.

641
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:03,231
Cheryl, I have your
best interests at heart.

642
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:06,002
Go ahead, take the deal
and you'II go to prison
for at Ieast five years.

643
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:07,702
And if you don't take the deal
and you get convicted,

644
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:10,974
you'II go for a minimum
of 15-to-Iife.

645
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:12,071
Well, do you think
we'II Iose?

646
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,139
You're not guilty, Cheryl.
Answer her question.

647
00:30:14,217 --> 00:30:15,206
Look, she's trying
to scare you.

648
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:16,479
Yeah, there's a chance
you'II Iose,

649
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:17,918
but think of everything
you're going to gain.

650
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:20,785
He's trying to make you
a martyr for the cause.

651
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:24,884
I'II take the deal.

652
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:26,758
You're making
a big mistake.

653
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,167
STABLER: How'd it go in court?

654
00:30:35,238 --> 00:30:36,535
Cheryl pled out.

655
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:42,904
You know that the only person
that came to support her
was her sister.

656
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:43,968
And you.

657
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:45,571
Yeah, but I'm not family.

658
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:48,740
Excuse me. Detective Benson.

659
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:50,547
Mr. Berger,
how can I help you?

660
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,520
Cheryl wants to talk
to you about her plea.

661
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,648
She needs to speak
to the A.D.A. about that.

662
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:57,454
My client's not a big fan
of Ms. Cabot.

663
00:30:57,527 --> 00:30:58,585
Why not?

664
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:01,826
Well, Cheryl feels she was
tricked into pleading out.

665
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:03,558
Well, why does she
want to talk to me?

666
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:06,158
She thinks you'II
understand the situation.

667
00:31:06,236 --> 00:31:07,931
What situation?

668
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:09,528
Her accommodations.

669
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:15,508
Look, you have to help me,
I cannot stay here.

670
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:18,274
Cheryl, you pled guilty.

671
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:20,543
You knew that you
were going to prison.
I'm a woman,

672
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:23,085
and they put me
in a cell with men.

673
00:31:24,654 --> 00:31:25,643
You didn't tell her?

674
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:27,189
I told her to go to trial.

675
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:28,246
Bull!

676
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,293
You set her up
for your own career.

677
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:32,794
What, the murder case
wasn't enough for you?

678
00:31:32,862 --> 00:31:34,830
The civil rights issue
is more pressing.

679
00:31:34,898 --> 00:31:35,922
Oh, and you're
going to ride it

680
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:37,398
all the way to the
Supreme Court, aren't you?

681
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:39,128
Why not? This could be
a precedent-setting case.

682
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:41,067
Yeah, not to mention
a juicy story.

683
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:44,698
A woman in a man's prison?
You'II have the media
drooling!

684
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm sorry.

685
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:53,412
Just help me.

686
00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:57,514
My hands are tied.
I can't move Cheryl
to a women's prison.

687
00:31:57,587 --> 00:31:58,849
She was going
to have surgery.

688
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:01,049
Unfortunately, she's still
anatomically male.

689
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:02,489
New York State
determines a person's

690
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:04,890
gender based
on their genitals,
not their feelings.

691
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:06,121
So you're not going
to do anything?

692
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:07,958
There's nothing I can do.

693
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:10,022
The Iaw says she's not
entitled to special treatment,

694
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:12,226
and I can't put a man
in a women's prison.

695
00:32:12,302 --> 00:32:14,668
But Cheryl is not
a man anymore.

696
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:17,797
Legally, she still is.

697
00:32:17,874 --> 00:32:20,434
Look, Berger has to
fight it out with the
Department of Corrections

698
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,241
and I have to
make an appearance.
I will see what I can do.

699
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:29,751
BERGER: Cheryl Avery
is a woman.

700
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:31,616
The State of New York
doesn't see it that way.

701
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:34,782
The medical community
would side with the defendant
in the matter of her gender.

702
00:32:34,857 --> 00:32:36,757
This hearing is not about
the politics of gender.

703
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:37,850
It's about where to house him.

704
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:42,227
It's extremely derogatory
to refer to my client
using male pronouns.

705
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:45,665
You have my sincere apology,
but biologically,
your client is a man.

706
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:49,227
My client will be
singled out for abuse
in a male facility.

707
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:50,863
Not if she stops
taking hormones.

708
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,933
Federal prison guidelines
state the pre-established
hormone Ievels

709
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:57,138
of transsexuals
must be maintained.

710
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:58,680
When prescribed
by a physician.

711
00:32:58,748 --> 00:32:59,976
Your client was
self-medicating

712
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,448
with a friend's
birth control pills.

713
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:04,645
Look, I'd rather die
than stop hormone therapy.

714
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:06,120
What about protective custody?

715
00:33:06,189 --> 00:33:10,125
Twenty-three hours a day
without human contact.

716
00:33:10,193 --> 00:33:11,592
That's cruel and unusual.

717
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:15,459
I'm generously giving
your client the choice.

718
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:18,989
Either stop the hormones
or go into protective custody.

719
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:21,630
There's nothing else
you can do?

720
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:26,633
The defendant has not yet
been sentenced, Your Honor.

721
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:30,805
AII right.

722
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,280
Then ask Judge Larsen
to vacate the guilty plea.

723
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:36,950
Take this to trial.
Hope for an acquittal.

724
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:39,185
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

725
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:43,390
What's this I hear about you
wanting off the Avery case?

726
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:46,553
I just don't think
I'm the right person
to try it.

727
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:48,893
That's not what I heard.

728
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:50,398
You've made
several impassioned

729
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:54,459
arguments on her behalf.
Perhaps you'd Iike to
defend her instead.

730
00:33:54,537 --> 00:33:56,164
Well, she could use
better representation

731
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:58,537
than that self-serving
snake Berger.

732
00:33:58,608 --> 00:34:01,975
Reptile though he may be,
Morty Berger's
a damn good attorney.

733
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:04,036
He deserves
a worthy adversary.

734
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:05,978
I think I'm more
sympathetic to Cheryl

735
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,812
than a prosecutor should be.

736
00:34:07,884 --> 00:34:11,081
A good A.D.A. has to think
on both sides of the fence.

737
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:13,987
Your empathy is a strength,
not a weakness.

738
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:16,752
You know, if Cheryl
had been born a woman,

739
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:19,317
a jury would have
no problem acquitting her.

740
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:20,794
She killed a man.

741
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:22,296
What do you care
what sex she is?

742
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:23,992
Because that,
and not the evidence,

743
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:25,261
is what's going
to convict her.

744
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:26,596
No, what's going
to convict her

745
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:28,398
is a jury of her peers,

746
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:31,235
not angels or
divine ethical beings.

747
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:37,176
I suppose it bothers me
more than it should.

748
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:42,015
Well, I'II reassign the case
if you Iike.

749
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:44,886
But you might
want to consider,

750
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:48,048
who's gonna give Cheryl Avery
the fairest treatment?

751
00:34:48,124 --> 00:34:51,855
You or some other
prosecutor who'II put
her gender on trial?

752
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:59,391
PSYCHIATRIST:
Gender identity dysphoria

753
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:02,802
occurs when a woman feels
trapped in a man's body.

754
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:06,035
These feelings are centered
in the hypothalamus gland
in the brain.

755
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:08,703
Specifically,
the stria terminalis.

756
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:11,246
PIease describe
the exhibits, Doctor.

757
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:14,875
The first photo is
the stria terminalis
of a male brain.

758
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:16,816
The second is that
of a female.

759
00:35:16,886 --> 00:35:20,879
The stria terminalis
of the male brain is much
Iarger than the female's.

760
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:24,825
BERGER: The third appears
to be the same size as
the female stria terminalis.

761
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:27,192
It is, but it's actually
the stria terminalis

762
00:35:27,263 --> 00:35:30,164
of a biological male
who is transsexual.

763
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:32,167
Are you saying, Doctor,

764
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:37,969
that despite being
born with male genitals,
a portion of this man's brain

765
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,065
is identical to a woman's?

766
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:41,435
Yes.

767
00:35:41,511 --> 00:35:43,809
And in your expert opinion,

768
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,508
explain what this means
in Cheryl's case.

769
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:51,986
Cheryl feels Iike a woman
because her brain is
physiologically female.

770
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,213
Thank you, Doctor.

771
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:00,254
Referring to the defense's
Exhibit Three,

772
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,890
the stria terminalis
of a male-to-female
transsexual.

773
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:07,200
Is that a picture of
the defendant's brain?
PSYCHIATRIST: No.

774
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,363
These are photographs
of cadaver brains.

775
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:11,702
Why didn't you photograph
Cheryl Avery's brain?

776
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:14,834
The stria terminalis is only
accessible post mortem.

777
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:18,778
So as far as you know
Cheryl's stria terminalis
is the size of a man's

778
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:19,940
and she's not a transsexual.

779
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:21,040
Object, Your Honor.

780
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:24,018
LARSEN: Overruled.
Answer the question, Doctor.

781
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:28,012
I can't respond with
certainty either way.

782
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:31,319
Nothing further.

783
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:36,120
Let's talk about
the first time

784
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,861
you were assaulted
for dressing as a woman.

785
00:36:40,436 --> 00:36:42,097
How old were you?

786
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:43,229
Twelve.

787
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,674
And what happened?

788
00:36:46,742 --> 00:36:48,039
I was in

789
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,036
my room wearing
my mom's bra and skirt

790
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:52,842
when my brother's
friend walked in.

791
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:54,446
What did he do?

792
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:55,643
He Iaughed.

793
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:58,947
And he said he would
tell everyone.

794
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,147
Did he?

795
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:02,615
Yeah.

796
00:37:04,293 --> 00:37:05,453
In fact,
the next day at school

797
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:07,257
three boys came
in the bathroom

798
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,925
and they hit me
and they kicked me,

799
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,592
and spit on me.

800
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:15,102
How many times
have you been assaulted?

801
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:19,335
I've had my nose broken
and my shoulder dislocated

802
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:22,900
and once someone
set fire to my hair.

803
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:29,250
Cheryl, how have these
repeated attacks affected you?

804
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:32,649
I was scared to
Ieave the house.

805
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:36,523
But I had no choice when
my parents kicked me out.

806
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,061
And every time someone
Iooked at me, I wondered,

807
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,692
"Are they going to hurt me?
Are they going to...

808
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:49,969
"Is this going to be the time
that someone kills me?"

809
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:54,367
When Joe Cappilla
assaulted you,

810
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:56,434
this is what
you were feeling?

811
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:57,570
Yes.

812
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,952
Your witness, Ms. Cabot.

813
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,816
So you thought your Iife
was in danger that night?

814
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:14,618
Yes.

815
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:18,198
Did anybody at the party
threaten you?

816
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:19,393
No, no.

817
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:24,295
Did anyone make
derogatory remarks
about transsexuals?

818
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:27,206
No, but why would they?
Nobody knew.

819
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,540
Had anyone at the party
ever hurt you before?

820
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:32,809
No. The only people
I knew there

821
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,009
were Joe and Eddie.

822
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:39,113
How Iong had you
been dating Eddie?

823
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,189
Two months.

824
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,387
Were you intimate?

825
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:47,255
Yeah.

826
00:38:48,597 --> 00:38:51,896
We kissed and fooled around,
but we never had sex.

827
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:55,033
Why not?

828
00:38:55,538 --> 00:38:57,005
Because I didn't want
Eddie to know

829
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,507
I hadn't had my surgery yet.

830
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:01,933
So you deceived him.

831
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,569
I had to.

832
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:07,810
What do you think
Eddie would have done
if he'd found out the truth?

833
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:11,216
I don't know.
Don't you?

834
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:15,951
You told Detective Benson
that you were afraid Eddie
was going to Ieave you.

835
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:18,357
In fact,
Eddie committed suicide
when he found out.

836
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:21,191
And I blame myself for that.

837
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:23,163
Do you blame yourself
for Joe's death?

838
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:28,064
I was protecting myself.

839
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,332
AII I wanted to do was
hit him over the head.

840
00:39:30,406 --> 00:39:35,343
If you hadn't killed him,
he would have told everyone
your secret when he came to.

841
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:37,669
Well, I wasn't thinking
that far ahead.

842
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,180
Weren't you?

843
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:42,981
Joe was going to tell Eddie,
and you couldn't
take that chance.

844
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,520
You were finally happy.
Eddie Ioved you.

845
00:39:45,588 --> 00:39:48,216
Well, Joe was gonna ruin that.

846
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,951
He was gonna ruin it,

847
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:51,754
and I couldn't Iet him do it.

848
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:54,625
I could not Iet him do it.
I had to stop him.

849
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:00,997
You did.

850
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:03,602
Nothing further.

851
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,316
Has the jury
reached the verdict?

852
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:17,545
We have, Your Honor.

853
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,986
LARSEN: Will the defendant
please rise?

854
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:26,561
On the sole count of murder
in the second degree,
how does the jury find?

855
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:29,898
We find the defendant

856
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,023
guilty.

857
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:35,931
PIease, please,
don't do this!

858
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:38,405
PIease, you can't
put me in that place!

859
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:41,534
PIease, help me, please.

860
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,272
Somebody! You can't
put me in that place!

861
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:52,245
Hey.

862
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:54,616
I'm heading out.
You want to grab a drink?

863
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,592
Thank you. But, you know,
I am just not in the mood.

864
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:02,290
Well, neither am I,
but I don't feel much
Iike going home.

865
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:06,564
Do you think I pushed
Cheryl too hard?

866
00:41:08,938 --> 00:41:10,667
You did your job.

867
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:14,234
Then why do I feel so Iousy?

868
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,710
Because you Iook at Cheryl,

869
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:25,147
and you can't imagine
what it's Iike to feel that
your own body is a mistake.

870
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:29,015
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

871
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,686
Benson.

872
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,592
We'II be right there.

873
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:36,522
What's up?

874
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:39,826
I gotta go to Bellevue.
You should come with me.

875
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,967
Special Victims Unit,
you called about
a rape victim.

876
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:49,670
They are taking him up
to surgery now.

877
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:53,007
CABOT: What happened?

878
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:55,346
Cheryl Avery was
gang-raped at Rikers.
