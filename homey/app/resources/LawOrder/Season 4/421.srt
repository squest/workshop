NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:05,731
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,966
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,976
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:13,571
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,342
These are their stories.

What in the hell
were you thinking?

9
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,814
You said to invite people.

10
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,253
I said, "Bring a friend,"
not 25 slobs.

11
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,517
You're out of cold beer.

12
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:24,751
Guess you should
go home, then.

13
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,588
You've got a phone call.
Whoever it is, I'm busy.

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,959
It's your neighbor.
It's something about
music and the cops.

15
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:33,033
Mrs. Grenis.
I'm turning it down.

Believe me, I'd Iove
for these parasites to Ieave.

(GLASS SHATTERING)
Okay. Oh, my God.

18
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,274
What are you doing
to my house?

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,749
Open the door.
Open the damn door!

20
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,187
What the hell happened?

21
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:56,416
He tried to rape me.

22
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,221
Rape victim's
a Cheryl Avery, 19.

23
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,093
Medic's checking her
out on the bus.

on the head with a vase.

Where is the
alleged attacker?

27
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,337
Oh, he's on way to Cabrini.
His name's a Joe Cappilla.

28
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,637
Miss Avery claims
he tried to rape her.

29
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,076
Well, it sounds Iike
you think she made it up.

30
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,307
Well, her blouse is torn
and her face was bruised,

31
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,907
but she refuses to go to
the ER to get checked out.

32
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:27,249
She was violated.
Doesn't want to be poked at.

33

Detective Benson, SVU.
Where's your patient?

34
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,616
In back.
No, she's not.

35
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,752
She was here a minute ago.

36
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,922
Must've bailed.

37
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,100
Son of a bitch.

38
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,349
Looks Iike they struggled.
See these black scuff marks?

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,823
Perp was wearing sneakers,
so these probably came
from Cheryl Avery's heels.

40
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:41,259
He shoved her backwards
into the window,
the glass broke,

41
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,354
she grabbed the vase
and whacked him with it.

42
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,991
Went down and banged
his head on the tub.

43
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,431
FIN: Find Cheryl yet?
Nope.

44
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,733
And neither did the sector car
I sent to her house.

45
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,864
The address she gave
the uniform is phony.

46
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,068
I wouldn't be surprised
if her name is, too.

47
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,010
Well, this was a party.
Somebody had to invite her.

48
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,673
I invited five friends over
for pizza and beer.

49
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,649
That Joe and Cheryl, they
weren't even on the Iist.

50
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,515
BENSON: Do you know them?
No. I don't hang out
with rapists.

51
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,385
And the first time
I saw Cheryl was in
my bathroom bleeding.

52
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,616
So who invited them?

53
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,558
(SIGHS) Name's Ricky.
Freaking social director.

54
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:18,787
Ricky, what can you
tell us about Joe?

55
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,994
Met him at a club.

56
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,037
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Thought he was cute
till he showed up high

57
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,231
and started hitting on
every girl in the room.

58
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,467
Joe hit on Cheryl?

59
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,769
Didn't see it,

60
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,810
but maybe that's why
he was fighting
with his brother.

61
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,539
Joe's brother was here?
Yeah.

62
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,047
Name's Eddie.
Cheryl's his girlfriend.

63
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,810
You have any idea
where Eddie Iives?

64
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,047
With Joe and their mom,
23rd and 9th.

65

Hospital.

66
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,287
Joe going to be okay?

67
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,914
No, Joe's dead.

68
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,593
My mom called
from the hospital

69
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,859
and told me everything, so...

70
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,594
We're so sorry
for your Ioss.

71
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:59,363
Eddie, we need to find out
what happened at that party.

72
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,874
My brother tried
to rape my girlfriend.

73
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,112
That's what the hospital
told my mom.

74
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,910
What did you see?

75
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,414
I Ieft early.

76
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,453
How come?

77
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,852
I started having
palpitations.

78
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,982
From fighting
with your brother?

79
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,050
Yeah. I got
a heart condition,

80
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:25,428
so I came home
to take my medicine.

81
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,990
BENSON: You didn't take
Cheryl with you?

82
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,433
I told her to stay.

83
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,734
She was dancing,
having a good time...

84
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,935
Bum Ieg keep you
from dancing with her?

85
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,503
Yeah, I sprained my ankle
playing hoops.

86
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,541
I know, with a heart
condition, it's stupid.

87
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,641
Eddie,

88
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,050
why were you and
your brother fighting?

89
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,649
He's a punk.
He treated women Iike dirt.

90
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,392
He ever get rough?

91
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,862
Yeah, when he got high,
which was all the time.

92
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,490
That's what we were
fighting about.

93
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,697
Cheryl is the nicest girl
I ever met.

94
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:09,937
She wouldn't hit Joe
unless he provoked her.

95
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,946
I mean, if she says it was
self-defense, then it was.

96
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,481
She ran away.

97
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,313
That Iooks real bad.

98
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,217
You want to help her?

99
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,619
Tell us where she is.

100
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,556
I wanted to tell Eddie
what happened,

101
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,254
but I didn't think
he'd understand.

102
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,763
BENSON: We're having
a hard time ourselves, Cheryl.

103
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,890
Why did you Ieave
the ambulance?

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,967
I thought you
wouldn't believe me.

105
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,435
It would be Joe's word
against mine.

106
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,200
AII we've got is your word.
Joe's dead.

107
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,633
Oh, my God.

108
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,307
Oh, my God.

109
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,049
I didn't...

110
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,318
I didn't mean to kill him.

111
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,588
Cheryl, tell us
what happened.

112
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,714
Will I go to jail?

113
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,623
Not if he attacked you,
it's self-defense.

114
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,555
Oh, God.

115
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,521
I...

116
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,862
I went to the bathroom
and Joe followed me in.

117
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,730
I tried to be nice to him
for Eddie's sake, but,

118
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,366
God, he's so disgusting.

119
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,966
He's constantly
putting Eddie down.

120
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,606
And I told him to get out,
but he wouldn't Ieave.

121
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,670
Did he touch you?

122
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,274
He put his hands on my...
On my breasts.

123
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:28,317
I tried to yell for help
but the music was too Ioud.

124
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,152
Then he ripped my shirt

125
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,055
and he punched me in the face.

126
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:39,058
And I grabbed something
and I hit him,
but he fought back.

127
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,360
So I pushed him off me,

128
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,235
and that's when he fell
and hit the tub.

129
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,671
So are you going to indict
Cheryl or give her a pass?

130
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,609
No, I'm in no hurry
to convene a grand jury.

131
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,876
The crime Iab confirmed
Cheryl's account,
it's justifiable homicide.

132
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:56,973
What else have we got?

133
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,382
Tox-screen on Joe.
Positive for crystal meth.

134
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,683
That explains his
pugnacious personality.

135
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,586
Yeah, still here.
Those bruises are real, AIex.

136
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,648
He definitely hit her.
Does Cheryl have any priors?

137
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,991
She's clean. But Joe isn't.
26 has a sexual
assault complaint

138
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,053
filed by a Paige Salinsky.

139
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,189
Was Joe arrested?

140
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,893
MUNCH: Miss Salinsky
dropped the charges.

141
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,628
So Joe has a habit
of getting high,

142
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,829
abusing women,
and his own brother
thinks he's a hump.

143
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,430
Well, don't forget
his brother just happens
to be the victim's boyfriend.

144
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,667
Joe's the only one
who can't speak.

145
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,676
Maybe his wounds still can.

146
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,804
If Joe did attack Cheryl,
he may have injuries
to show for it.

147
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,781
Check with EMS
and the medical examiner.

148
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,615
Yeah, I remember.
Got him stabilized
halfway to the hospital

149
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,247
when he seized,
went into cardiac arrest.

150
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,483
DOA.

151
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:40,686
Doc told us Iater that
the blows to the head caused
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

152
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,252
Well, did you notice
any other injuries?

153
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,991
Scratches, swelling?

154
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,533
Three knuckles
on his right hand
were cut up.

155
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,262
Bruise on Cheryl's face
was on the Ieft side.

156
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,633
So he punches her
with his right,

157
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,171
he cuts his hand
on her teeth.

158
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,900
Hey, you remember
anything else?

159
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,942
Before the seizure,
the guy was rambling.

160
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:56,998
Any of it make sense?

161
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,510
You tell me.

162
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,514
"Get Eddie, get Eddie.
He did it, he did it."

163
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,744
Are you sure that
he said Eddie?

164
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,548
Anything the patient says,
I write down.

165
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,613
Sounds Iike Cheryl
didn't tell us everything.

166
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,483
VERONICA: May I help you?

167
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,585
BENSON: Yeah,
we're Iooking for Cheryl.

168
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,256
In back. She's got company.

169
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,668
BENSON: Looks Iike
we're interrupting.

170
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,734
STABLER: Guess they had to
get their stories straight.

171
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,003
What do you mean?

172
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,071
Stop screwing us around,
the both of you.

173
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,479
Look, I told you
what happened.

174
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,347
BENSON: Yeah, you Ieft out
a few details.

175
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,442
Like what?

176
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,317
That bathroom window
was broken out.

177
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,380
It's a fifteen foot
drop to the ground.

178
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,789
How'd you really
sprain your ankle?

179
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,952
Wait, Eddie had
nothing to do with this.

180
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,019
STABLER: That's not
what Joe said.

181
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,757
What are you talking about?

182
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,494
In the ambulance,
before he died.

183
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,798
He said, "He did it.
Get Eddie."

184
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,807
Joe tried to rape me.
I hit him, he fell and
he banged his head.

185
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,041
Cheryl, you're hindering
a murder investigation.

186
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,242
Now, Joe said
that Eddie did it.

187
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,046
And I understand
that you're trying to

188
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,347
protect him.
Eddie went home.

189
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,409
We know that.

190
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,980
But we have witnesses that
saw Eddie and Joe fighting,
and then Eddie Ieft.

191
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,582
But he came back,
didn't he?

192
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,821
No. No.

193
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,387
If Joe was attacking you
and Eddie

194
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,364
walked in and came
to your defense,

195
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,401
then Joe's death
is an accident.

196
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,299
You tried to stop him,
it got out of hand.

197
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,803
You didn't mean
to kill anybody.

198
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,396
That's not what happened.

199
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,770
Eddie, no one's
gonna put you away

200
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,365
for protecting
your girlfriend.

201
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,968
I swear I never
touched Joe.

202
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,048
Oh, Eddie.

203
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:48,083
Okay, Eddie. Okay,
so I've got this all wrong.

204
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,783
Maybe Joe didn't try
to rape Cheryl, huh?

205
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:51,983
Of course he did.

206
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,993
No, you know
what I'm thinking?

207
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,585
You caught Joe and
Cheryl getting it on

208
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,653
behind your back
in that bathroom.
No.

209
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,723
No, no.
The betrayal,
the blind rage...

210
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,301
Cheryl Ioves me.

211
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,337
BENSON: Were you
making out with Joe?

212
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,271
Oh, my God, I would...
No, I would never
do that to Eddie.

213
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:11,402
Of course you didn't mean to,
but Eddie Ieft you alone
at a party with Joe,

214
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,775
so he starts making
the moves on you,

215
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,006
you got caught up
in the moment.

216
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,275
Wait, wait. No, no, no.

217
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,907
So you didn't want
Eddie to know...
You're wrong...

218
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:20,112
So when he walked in,
you said that Joe
was raping you.

219
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,485
And he responded Iike
any good boyfriend would.

220
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:23,545
STABLER: You hit Joe.

221
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,387
No, I didn't.
You went back to the party

222
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,551
to bring Cheryl home.
Don't do this.

223
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,753
You find her
in the bathroom...
What?

224
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,591
...with your brother's
hands all over her.

225
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,689
Come on, Eddie, be a man.
Don't Iet your girlfriend
go down

226
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,166
for something
you did.
Okay!

227
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,467
I was in the room.
I was there.

228
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,631
Just tell me what happened.

229
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,675
He was being a prick

230
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:47,043
to some of the girls
at the party.
And I told him, "Stop."

231
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,482
He got pissed,
gave me a shove,

232
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,142
then I Ieft.
We know,

233
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,653
to go home and get your pills.
We've been through that!

234
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,322
Why are you telling me that?

235
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,756
I want to know,
why did you come back?

236
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,988
I felt bad 'cause
I Ieft Cheryl there.

237
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,326
Joe was already
on the floor

238
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,662
when I walked
into that bathroom.

239
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,698
Cheryl Iocked the door,
said Joe tried to rape her,

240
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,530
just Iike she told you.

241
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,732
So you didn't see anything.

242
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,468
That's awful convenient.
Why would you jump
out the window?

243
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,102
She said people
would think I did it

244
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,170
'cause they saw Joe
and me fighting earlier.

245
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,642
(GROANING)

246
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,947
Cheryl was only trying
to protect me.

247
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,156
Eddie says he was
in the bathroom,

248
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,196
Cheryl says he wasn't.
I can't tell who's
covering for whom.

249
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,960
Eddie fought with his brother
in front of a dozen witnesses.

250
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,058
His brother winds up dead.

251
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,932
What if the rape itself
is the Iie?

252
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,272
Do you think Cheryl made
the whole thing up?

253
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,863
To cover for Eddie.

254
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,239
He kills Joe in the bathroom,
Cheryl walks in,

255
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,504
tells Eddie to go
out the window,

256
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,307
she'II say Joe was
trying to rape her.

257
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,905
Well, then they're
co-conspirators. And
I can't use anything

258
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,540
either one of them
says against the other

259
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,209
without independent
corroboration.

260
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:02,551
We canvassed
everyone at the party.
Nobody saw anything.

261
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,989
Let's see whose story the
physical evidence supports.

262
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,627
We're not done with
the reconstruction yet,
but I can tell you

263
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,188
that everyone's prints
are in that bathroom.

264
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,494
Eddie admits
he was there.

265
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,557
There's no surprise.

266
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,468
This will be.
This is Joe's shirt.

267
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,438
The blood on it
only belongs to him.

268
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,565
This is Cheryl's.

269
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,302
Two different blood types,
both male.

270
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,934
One matches Joe,
the other's unknown.

271
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,603
So it's gotta be Eddie's.
It's not.

272
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,844
Y-chromosomes from the DNA
say the samples come
from two unrelated males.

273
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,782
So now we got another guy
in that bathroom with Joe,
Eddie and Cheryl?

274
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,584
That's what I thought
until I tested this.

275
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:37,748
STABLER: You get that
out of the bathroom?

276
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,257
No. From EMS.

277
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,918
Medics used it to wrap
Cheryl's bloody hand,

278
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,552
then we collected it
for evidence.

279
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,655
It's called a control sample
because the only blood on it
is Cheryl's.

280
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,324
Well, what's that
gonna tell us?

281
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,560
I compared the blood
on the bandage

282
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,229
to our unknown male.
It was a match.

283
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,277
Cheryl's a man?

284
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,937
What in the hell
are we dealing with?

285
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,949
Probably a pre-op
transsexual.

286
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,211
STABLER: If she's still
got her package,

287
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,446
it explains why she didn't
go to the hospital
to be examined.

288
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,513
I've seen
plenty of trannies,
but she is amazing.

289
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,217
She's gotta be
taking hormones.

290
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,487
Boys with breasts get
more money on the street.

291
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,291
I don't make her for a pro.
She's got a straight job.

292
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,264
Probably saving up enough
money for the surgery.

293
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,890
Well, none of this
changes the fact

294
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,264
that Joe still
tried to rape her.

295
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,700
She's got the bruises
to show for it.

296
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,330
Maybe he got violent
when he discovered
her secret.

297
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,397
Or Joe threatened
to tell Eddie,

298
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,067
giving Cheryl motive
to kill him.

299
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,235
STABLER: Eddie's gotta know.

300
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,438
He and Cheryl have
been going out for
a couple of months now.

301
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,276
They were all over each other
when we picked them up.

302
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,839
So they're both covering up
Cheryl's secret.

303
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,613
Who do you think
we should try to break first?

304
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,847
Cheryl's pulling
all the strings,
telling Eddie what to say.

305
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,322
My guess is he's
the weaker Iink.

306
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:51,162
Eddie, I know you've
been through a Iot.

307
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,898
I don't want to
make things worse.

308
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,060
What do you mean?

309
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,161
I'm not here to judge you.

310
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,398
You know that, right?

311
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,406
I just want to find out what
happened in that bathroom.

312
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,772
I already told you.

313
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,346
I walked into the bathroom.

314
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:12,609
Joe was on the floor.
Cheryl was beat up.

315
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,215
You didn't tell us
about Cheryl, though.

316
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,384
What about her?

317
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:26,260
What you do
in your private Iife
is your business.

318
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,528
You gotta start
being honest with me.

319
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,602
I am being honest. What?

320
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:38,440
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

321
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,080
I'm talking about
Cheryl being a man.

322
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,378
(SCOFFS)

323
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:57,354
What kind of
sick joke is this?

324
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,461
I'm sorry you had to
find out this way.

325
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,594
You're crazy.

326
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,763
(CHUCKLES)

327
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,071
I have... I've seen her...
I've seen her breasts.

328
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,303
Female hormones.

329
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:16,104
They can do that.
Look, Eddie,
she had us all fooled.

330
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,583
We did a blood test.

331
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,582
(YELLING)

332
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,822
(GRUNTS) What are you
saying to me?

333
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,786
I held her! I kissed her.

334
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,966
I wanted to spend my Iife
with her. What are you...

335
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,176
She wouldn't have sex.

336
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,646
She said she wanted to wait.

337
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:52,515
She would just
push my hands away.

338
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,522
Oh, God. I need to see her,

339
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,753
I need to see her.
I want to talk to her.
Eddie.

340
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:06,165
Eddie!
Don't.

341
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:13,198
What's wrong with you?

342
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,799
Why are you Iooking
at me Iike that?

343
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,771
Say something.

344
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,641
Oh, oh!

345
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:30,147
You are a freak!
No!

346
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:33,751
STABLER: Eddie, get off.
Eddie. Eddie.

347
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,289
Okay?

348
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:39,865
Look, I was gonna tell you.

349
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:40,958
When?

350
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,900
After I had the surgery.

351
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,938
Oh, you make me sick.

352
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:49,073
Oh, God.

353
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:53,012
Why did you do this? Why?

354
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:58,751
Cheryl, stand up, come on.
It's okay. Come on, come on.

355
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,250
We thought that Eddie knew.

356
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:06,054
We thought that
he was protecting you.

357
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:11,227
How Iong did you think
that you could keep
this a secret?

358
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:15,359
I just thought if I could
make him Iove me enough,
he'd understand.

359
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:19,566
Okay, well, Iet's sit down.
Come on. Come on, sit down.

360
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,747
But you were also afraid
that he wouldn't understand.

361
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:33,980
For the first time in my Iife,
I had someone who Ioves me.

362
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:40,322
And if Joe was to tell Eddie,
that would be over.

363
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,091
My Iife would be over.

364
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:44,791
So what happened?

365
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,531
Joe was walking
out of the bathroom,

366
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,970
so I picked up the vase
and I hit him.

367
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,537
And then Eddie walked in.

368
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,372
I never meant to kill Joe.

369
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:01,014
I just didn't
want him to talk.

370
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,587
You'II have to tell Eddie
that I didn't mean to do it.

371
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:12,624
I mean, please make him
understand that.

372
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,324
You okay?

373
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,924
Oh, I'II never be okay.

374
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:25,838
This wasn't your fault.

375
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,464
Yeah, it was.

376
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:32,976
My brother's dead because
my girlfriend's a guy.

377
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:36,239
I should've...

378
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:37,909
No one knew.

379
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:46,350
What if I did know,
deep down?

380
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,197
You were in Iove with a woman.

381
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,768
That's what you knew.

382
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,636
You sure you're
okay? Huh?
Yeah.

383
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:05,702
I need some air.

384
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,837
Whoa!

385
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,340
I need some help in here!

386
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:14,249
What happened?
He just collapsed.

387
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,447
He's got a heart condition.

388
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:17,582
Call an ambulance.
Hardly has any pulse.

389
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,920
STABLER: This is empty.

390
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,654
Digoxin.
It's stopping his heart.

391
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,491
We got a drug overdose.

392
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:25,890
I'm Iosing his pulse.
You better start CPR.

393
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,795
Eddie!

394
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,199
Come on, Eddie!

395
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,302
Come on, Eddie!

396
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,375
He was pulseless
for ten minutes.

397
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,574
I pronounced him
at 1815.

398
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,708
You got
the pill vial?

399
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:44,944
Yeah, it's right here.

400
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:48,079
I'II do the autopsy,
I'II get you the results
quick as I can,

401
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:50,282
but doesn't Iook to me
Iike anything
other than a suicide.

402
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,121
It's a death in custody,
suicide or not.

403
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:54,354
You guys from
Internal Affairs

404
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:56,396
are Iike sharks smelling
blood a mile away.

405
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:57,555
Save it, Captain.

406
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:58,859
I got an investigation
to conduct.

407
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:01,401
You think we forced the pills
down his throat?

408
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,833
TUCKER: No, but you
Ieft a Iethal dose

409
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:06,498
of pharmaceuticals
in possession of
a distraught suspect.

410
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,538
Talk to me
through my delegate.

411
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:12,238
That distraught suspect
needed those pills
for a heart condition.

412
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:14,781
That still doesn't mitigate
your failure to supervise

413
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:16,543
Detective Stabler
and Agent Huang.

414
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,484
IAB doesn't have
jurisdiction
over Doctor Huang.

415
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:23,683
We'II refer his conduct
to the FBI's Office of
Professional Responsibility.

416
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:27,215
I hope your
med-mal insurance
is paid up, Doc.

417
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,702
COURT OFFICER: AII rise.
The Honorable
Judge Seligman presiding.

418
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:36,895
CLERK: Now in session.

419
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:40,964
Docket ending 5971,
"People v. Cheryl Avery.

420
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,703
"One count, murder
in the second degree."

421
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:45,711
Morton Berger
for the defense, Your Honor.

422
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,475
We all know
who you are, Mr. Berger.

423
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,948
How does your client plead?

424
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,507
Not guilty.

425
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,574
SELIGMAN: Ms. Cabot?

426
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:54,245
Uh... Remand.

427
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,617
My client is not
a threat to the community.

428
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,022
She has no prior
criminal record, Your Honor.

429
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:01,118
And you can't hold
a press conference
in a Iock-up.

430
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:02,287
She's out of Iine,
Your Honor.

431
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:04,092
Oh, come on, Morty.
You wouldn't have
taken this case

432
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:06,689
if you didn't smell
the publicity.

433
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,565
Bail is set at $200,000.

434
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:12,037
Mr. Berger, are you going with
an insanity defense?

435
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:16,008
Absolutely not.
This case is entirely about
society's prejudice...

436
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:19,637
REPORTER 1:
Ms. Cabot, Ms. Cabot,
a few questions, please.

437
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:21,806
Ms. Cabot, hold on.
The D.A.'s office
will try this case

438
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,009
in the courtroom,
not the press. Thank you.

439
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,346
REPORTER 2: Come on,
Ms. Cabot, give us a break.

440
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:26,784
REPORTER 3: Come on,
just help us out here.

441
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,754
Just something, huh?
Come on.

442
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,450
Don't want your 15
minutes of fame, AIex?

443
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,652
I hear you paid
Cheryl's bail.
That's a nice touch.

444
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:36,525
Can't take the full credit.
That was the generosity
of my firm.

445
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,360
Well, Cheryl makes
a Iovely poster child,

446
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,161
so I'm guessing you're
doing this pro bono.

447
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,498
And you work
for a pittance,
so we're even.

448
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,127
You're wasting your time.

449
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:46,365
The judge is never
going to suppress
Cheryl's confession.

450
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,532
Good.

451
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,339
I need it to support
my argument that she
acted in self-defense.

452
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:54,074
Joe Cappilla was
Ieaving the bathroom.
The threat had abated.

453
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,615
Her Iife was
no Ionger in danger.

454
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:58,675
Yeah, until Joe told
the waiting Iynch mob
she was transsexual.

455
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,312
Predictions of violence
are notoriously unreliable.

456
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,253
Nobody can say what
Joe might have done.

457
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:04,348
Come on.

458
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:09,025
We both know what people do
when they find out the truth
about the trans-gendered.

459
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:10,959
They kill them.

460
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:14,731
Now, Cheryl's not responsible
for beating Joe to death

461
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:17,202
because she's trans-gendered.
Well, that's an excuse.

462
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:19,239
It is, and it works.
You think
she's gonna walk?

463
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:23,402
I doubt it. The irony is
Berger's argument may
actually work for our case.

464
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:26,037
People are generally hostile
towards the trans-gendered.

465
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:27,171
So a jury will be, too.

466
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:30,842
Berger's gonna put witnesses
up there for Cheryl,
or whatever his name is,

467
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:33,682
to tell us all about
how he grew up
tormented, brutalized,

468
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:34,982
and treated Iike a freak.

469
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:37,387
You know, it sounds Iike you
have a problem with Cheryl.

470
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,518
My problem is this he-she
and her Iies are the reason

471
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:41,822
we've got two dead bodies
on our hands,

472
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:43,294
and I'm the one
who's all jammed up?

473
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:45,195
Look, I need background
on Cheryl now.

474
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:47,358
AII we know so far is that

475
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,265
she changed her name when
she was 18 years old.

476
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:51,361
She used to be called
Charles Avery.

477
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,996
Her parents still Iive
in AIphabet City.

478
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:54,233
Then why don't you
go talk to them?

479
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:56,037
Maybe they can undercut
Cheryl's abuse story.

480
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,237
I don't know, AIex.
I talked to her.

481
00:22:58,312 --> 00:22:59,677
And unless she's
a damned good actor,

482
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:01,271
she is completely
in Iove with Eddie

483
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:02,474
and was afraid
of Iosing him.

484
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,846
So she kills
Eddie's brother?

485
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,646
True Iove doesn't
mitigate murder.

486
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,914
I don't think
she's a violent person.

487
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:09,785
That's fine. Prove it.

488
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,697
Charlie was 16
when he started
growing breasts.

489
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:19,596
Stole the hormones his mother
was taking for menopause.

490
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,655
We couldn't take it anymore.

491
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:21,826
Is that when she Ieft?

492
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:22,891
JOHN: We threw him out.

493
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,267
You think we're cruel,
Detective,

494
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:26,238
but we'd already
Iost our son.

495
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,638
There was nothing else
we could do.

496
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:29,698
What about therapy?

497
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,108
Charlie refused to go.

498
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,476
He insisted that inside
he felt Iike a woman,

499
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,811
and nothing was
gonna change that.

500
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,544
God doesn't make mistakes.

501
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,245
We've got two younger sons
and a daughter.

502
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,288
Now, how could we explain
Charlie waxing his Iegs
and wearing makeup?

503
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:44,256
Mom?
Sarah, honey,
go to the kitchen.

504
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:45,757
We'II be done soon.

505
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:46,884
Okay.

506
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,923
How did Cheryl get along
with her siblings?

507
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,194
They stopped hanging
around with him

508
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,259
because they were getting
teased at school.

509
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:58,702
Well, how did Cheryl
do in school? Did she
ever have any fights...

510
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,205
Charlie!

511
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,570
His name is Charlie.

512
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:08,444
Was he ever violent,
Mr. Avery?

513
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:13,914
He beat a kid
with a baseball bat.
Put him in the hospital.

514
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,284
That violent enough?

515
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,195
Detective?

516
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:26,488
Sarah, right?

517
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,838
My parents are wrong.

518
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,209
You still talk to Cheryl?

519
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,647
Yes, but if my parents knew,
they'd kick me out, too.

520
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:48,176
Your parents said that
Cheryl once beat somebody
with a baseball bat.

521
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,450
She cut through the field
one day after school.

522
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,048
The baseball team
saw her and chased her.

523
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,252
She had to grab a bat
to defend herself.

524
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,556
This kind of thing
happen a Iot?

525
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:58,156
AII the time, I mean,
kids made fun of her
Iike she was a big joke.

526
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,962
Anybody ever hurt
her physically?

527
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,433
They beat
the hell out of her
whenever they could.

528
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:05,064
I mean, she had to
go to the hospital
three times for stitches.

529
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,538
I don't care
what anybody says,

530
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:09,099
she's the bravest
person I know.

531
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,675
I talked to her teachers.

532
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:14,909
A sympathetic one
suggested that she
transfer to Harvey Milk,

533
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:16,245
an alternative
public school

534
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:17,909
for gay and
trans-gendered kids.

535
00:25:17,986 --> 00:25:19,044
So why didn't she go?

536
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,747
Because her parents
wouldn't Iet her.

537
00:25:20,822 --> 00:25:22,084
Where are you
going with this?

538
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:24,750
AII I need to know
is whether or not
Cheryl's been violent.

539
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:27,226
Only in self-defense.

540
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:29,820
One time, two boys
held her up against

541
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:31,422
a wall and pulled
her pants down.

542
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,899
AIex, this girl has
been through hell.

543
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:36,334
I know she's been a victim
and I know she's suffered.

544
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,838
But that doesn't give Cheryl
the right to kill Joe Cappilla

545
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:40,033
for threatening
to expose her.

546
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:41,871
Then at Ieast
offer her a plea.

547
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:44,070
Not until I know her intent.

548
00:25:45,513 --> 00:25:47,310
If Berger will agree
to a psych evaluation,

549
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:50,249
I'II have Huang
talk to Cheryl.

550
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:53,378
Yeah, when I was seven,
I knew I was different.

551
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:56,949
I mean,
every night I'd go to bed
dreaming about being a girl.

552
00:25:57,025 --> 00:25:59,653
Well, how did
you handle that?

553
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,058
Forced myself to be a boy.

554
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:04,228
That must have been difficult.

555
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,292
Yeah, I played with GI Joes
when I wanted to
dress up Barbies.

556
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:13,503
When was the first time that
you tried to become a woman?
Can you remember?

557
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:16,066
Yeah, I was ten.

558
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:19,636
And my father caught me
putting on my mother's makeup.

559
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:22,039
And what did he do?

560
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:25,847
Well, he beat
the crap out of me and
he called me a pervert.

561
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:30,049
Did that change
your feelings any?

562
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:31,284
No.

563
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,025
It's not something
you can change.

564
00:26:36,164 --> 00:26:38,860
I mean, it's... It's me.
It's how I feel.

565
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:42,492
And I can't be anything else,

566
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,162
but I wanted to be
a whole woman.

567
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:45,695
Sure.

568
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:49,908
And I needed the surgery.
Especially after I met Eddie.

569
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:51,601
Eddie.

570
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:53,937
Had you ever considered
telling him?

571
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:55,880
No, no.

572
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,119
I figured I'd Iose him.

573
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:04,418
I mean, Eddie was
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

574
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:07,893
I mean, he was the first man
that Ioved me as a woman.

575
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:12,627
And I figured
if I had the surgery,
I wouldn't have to tell him.

576
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,725
But Joe was gonna
tell him, right?

577
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:16,463
How did that make you feel?

578
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,139
I saw fists punching me
Iike all those times before.

579
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:24,735
Any time Cheryl's
been violent,

580
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:26,643
it's been in response
to a perceived threat.

581
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:28,909
Joe had stopped the attack
and was Ieaving the bathroom.

582
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:30,780
The threat was over.
Not in her mind.

583
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,513
She feared what those
drunken party-goers

584
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:34,020
would do to her when
she Ieft that bathroom.

585
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,680
Boy, you'd make a great
witness for the defense.

586
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:37,850
I'm just calling it
Iike I see it, AIex.

587
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:40,826
I don't think she
intended to kill Joe.

588
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,021
AII right.

589
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:44,926
If you're convinced,
I'II drop it to man one.

590
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:50,070
I told Cheryl
about your offer,

591
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:52,299
but she wants
to go to trial.

592
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,568
She does, or you do?

593
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:57,943
Do you know why
I became a Iawyer, AIex?

594
00:27:58,212 --> 00:28:00,510
To see your face on TV?

595
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:04,781
To change society's
misconceptions
about what's normal.

596
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,150
I'm here for the underdog.

597
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:09,519
You're here for yourself.

598
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,818
No, I'm here for a cause.

599
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:12,757
Gender is not always binary.

600
00:28:12,827 --> 00:28:14,692
People are afraid
of what they don't know.

601
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:15,990
Cheryl's case can change that.

602
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,190
Are you so sure of this

603
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:20,132
that you're willing to
serve up your client
as the sacrificial Iamb?

604
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,465
She could spend the rest
of her Iife in prison.

605
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:25,267
Not after this is tried in
the court of public opinion.

606
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:30,038
Joe Cappilla sexually
assaulted Cheryl Avery
and threatened to out her.

607
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:32,136
She fought back
to save her Iife.

608
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:35,448
She's not going to prison.

609
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:43,946
Hello.

610
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,384
Thanks for meeting me.

611
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:49,223
Well, I shouldn't be
speaking to you
without my attorney.

612
00:28:49,297 --> 00:28:51,288
I shouldn't be
asking you to,

613
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:54,994
but I'm very concerned
about how Mr. Berger
is handling your case.

614
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:58,500
You're the one prosecuting me.
Why would you care?

615
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:01,701
Because I think you're
getting bad advice.

616
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:02,902
No, he's...

617
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:05,912
No, he's the only one
who's been on my side.

618
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,004
He knows what
I've been through.

619
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:08,105
Then he should be
the first one

620
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:11,310
to tell you that your chances
of acquittal are slim to none.

621
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:14,320
I was attacked
and almost raped, okay?

622
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:16,413
He says a jury
will take my side.

623
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:18,823
I think a jury is going
to have some trouble

624
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:22,090
separating the facts of
the case from who you are.

625
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:25,864
Well, if you're so sure
I'm going to Iose,
then why are you here?

626
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,198
Because I want to know
why you won't take the deal.

627
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:31,998
What deal?

628
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:38,238
I told Berger
I would plead down to
first-degree manslaughter.

629
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:41,174
He never told me.

630
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:45,677
You had no right to speak
to my client without me.

631
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:47,118
I'm taking this
to Judge Larsen

632
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:48,382
and the disciplinary
committee.

633
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,650
Go ahead.
They'II Iove the part

634
00:29:49,724 --> 00:29:50,952
where you ignored
your obligation

635
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,287
to bring my deal
to your client

636
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,294
and then Iied to me
and told me you had.

637
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:58,025
I've done hundreds of trials
and made new case Iaw.

638
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,930
I think I know what's
best for my client.

639
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,434
Doesn't Cheryl have
a right to decide?

640
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:02,526
Fine.

641
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:05,231
Cheryl, I have your
best interests at heart.

642
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:08,002
Go ahead, take the deal
and you'II go to prison
for at Ieast five years.

643
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,702
And if you don't take the deal
and you get convicted,

644
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:12,974
you'II go for a minimum
of 15-to-Iife.

645
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:14,071
Well, do you think
we'II Iose?

646
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,139
You're not guilty, Cheryl.
Answer her question.

647
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:17,206
Look, she's trying
to scare you.

648
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:18,479
Yeah, there's a chance
you'II Iose,

649
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:19,918
but think of everything
you're going to gain.

650
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,785
He's trying to make you
a martyr for the cause.

651
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:26,884
I'II take the deal.

652
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:28,758
You're making
a big mistake.

653
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,167
STABLER: How'd it go in court?

654
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:38,535
Cheryl pled out.

655
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:44,904
You know that the only person
that came to support her
was her sister.

656
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:45,968
And you.

657
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:47,571
Yeah, but I'm not family.

658
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,740
Excuse me. Detective Benson.

659
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,547
Mr. Berger,
how can I help you?

660
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,520
Cheryl wants to talk
to you about her plea.

661
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,648
She needs to speak
to the A.D.A. about that.

662
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:58,454
My client's not a big fan
of Ms. Cabot.

663
00:30:58,527 --> 00:30:59,585
Why not?

664
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:02,826
Well, Cheryl feels she was
tricked into pleading out.

665
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:04,558
Well, why does she
want to talk to me?

666
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:07,158
She thinks you'II
understand the situation.

667
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,931
What situation?

668
00:31:09,004 --> 00:31:10,528
Her accommodations.

669
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:16,508
Look, you have to help me,
I cannot stay here.

670
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:19,274
Cheryl, you pled guilty.

671
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:21,543
You knew that you
were going to prison.
I'm a woman,

672
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:24,085
and they put me
in a cell with men.

673
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:26,643
You didn't tell her?

674
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:28,189
I told her to go to trial.

675
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:29,246
Bull!

676
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:32,293
You set her up
for your own career.

677
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:33,794
What, the murder case
wasn't enough for you?

678
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:35,830
The civil rights issue
is more pressing.

679
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:36,922
Oh, and you're
going to ride it

680
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:38,398
all the way to the
Supreme Court, aren't you?

681
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,128
Why not? This could be
a precedent-setting case.

682
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,067
Yeah, not to mention
a juicy story.

683
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:45,698
A woman in a man's prison?
You'II have the media
drooling!

684
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,040
I'm sorry.

685
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:54,412
Just help me.

686
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:58,514
My hands are tied.
I can't move Cheryl
to a women's prison.

687
00:31:58,587 --> 00:31:59,849
She was going
to have surgery.

688
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:02,049
Unfortunately, she's still
anatomically male.

689
00:32:02,124 --> 00:32:03,489
New York State
determines a person's

690
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:05,890
gender based
on their genitals,
not their feelings.

691
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:07,121
So you're not going
to do anything?

692
00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:08,958
There's nothing I can do.

693
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:11,022
The Iaw says she's not
entitled to special treatment,

694
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:13,226
and I can't put a man
in a women's prison.

695
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:15,668
But Cheryl is not
a man anymore.

696
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:18,797
Legally, she still is.

697
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:21,434
Look, Berger has to
fight it out with the
Department of Corrections

698
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,241
and I have to
make an appearance.
I will see what I can do.

699
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:30,751
BERGER: Cheryl Avery
is a woman.

700
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,616
The State of New York
doesn't see it that way.

701
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:35,782
The medical community
would side with the defendant
in the matter of her gender.

702
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,757
This hearing is not about
the politics of gender.

703
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:38,850
It's about where to house him.

704
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:43,227
It's extremely derogatory
to refer to my client
using male pronouns.

705
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:46,665
You have my sincere apology,
but biologically,
your client is a man.

706
00:32:46,735 --> 00:32:50,227
My client will be
singled out for abuse
in a male facility.

707
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:51,863
Not if she stops
taking hormones.

708
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,933
Federal prison guidelines
state the pre-established
hormone Ievels

709
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:58,138
of transsexuals
must be maintained.

710
00:32:58,213 --> 00:32:59,680
When prescribed
by a physician.

711
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:00,976
Your client was
self-medicating

712
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:02,448
with a friend's
birth control pills.

713
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:05,645
Look, I'd rather die
than stop hormone therapy.

714
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:07,120
What about protective custody?

715
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:11,125
Twenty-three hours a day
without human contact.

716
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:12,592
That's cruel and unusual.

717
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:16,459
I'm generously giving
your client the choice.

718
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:19,989
Either stop the hormones
or go into protective custody.

719
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:22,630
There's nothing else
you can do?

720
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:27,633
The defendant has not yet
been sentenced, Your Honor.

721
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:31,805
AII right.

722
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,280
Then ask Judge Larsen
to vacate the guilty plea.

723
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:37,950
Take this to trial.
Hope for an acquittal.

724
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:40,185
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

725
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:44,390
What's this I hear about you
wanting off the Avery case?

726
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:47,553
I just don't think
I'm the right person
to try it.

727
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:49,893
That's not what I heard.

728
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:51,398
You've made
several impassioned

729
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:55,459
arguments on her behalf.
Perhaps you'd Iike to
defend her instead.

730
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:57,164
Well, she could use
better representation

731
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:59,537
than that self-serving
snake Berger.

732
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:02,975
Reptile though he may be,
Morty Berger's
a damn good attorney.

733
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:05,036
He deserves
a worthy adversary.

734
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:06,978
I think I'm more
sympathetic to Cheryl

735
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:08,812
than a prosecutor should be.

736
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:12,081
A good A.D.A. has to think
on both sides of the fence.

737
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:14,987
Your empathy is a strength,
not a weakness.

738
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:17,752
You know, if Cheryl
had been born a woman,

739
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:20,317
a jury would have
no problem acquitting her.

740
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:21,794
She killed a man.

741
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:23,296
What do you care
what sex she is?

742
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:24,992
Because that,
and not the evidence,

743
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:26,261
is what's going
to convict her.

744
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:27,596
No, what's going
to convict her

745
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:29,398
is a jury of her peers,

746
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:32,235
not angels or
divine ethical beings.

747
00:34:35,343 --> 00:34:38,176
I suppose it bothers me
more than it should.

748
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:43,015
Well, I'II reassign the case
if you Iike.

749
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:45,886
But you might
want to consider,

750
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:49,048
who's gonna give Cheryl Avery
the fairest treatment?

751
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:52,855
You or some other
prosecutor who'II put
her gender on trial?

752
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:00,391
PSYCHIATRIST:
Gender identity dysphoria

753
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:03,802
occurs when a woman feels
trapped in a man's body.

754
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:07,035
These feelings are centered
in the hypothalamus gland
in the brain.

755
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:09,703
Specifically,
the stria terminalis.

756
00:35:09,778 --> 00:35:12,246
PIease describe
the exhibits, Doctor.

757
00:35:12,314 --> 00:35:15,875
The first photo is
the stria terminalis
of a male brain.

758
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:17,816
The second is that
of a female.

759
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:21,879
The stria terminalis
of the male brain is much
Iarger than the female's.

760
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:25,825
BERGER: The third appears
to be the same size as
the female stria terminalis.

761
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:28,192
It is, but it's actually
the stria terminalis

762
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:31,164
of a biological male
who is transsexual.

763
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:33,167
Are you saying, Doctor,

764
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:38,969
that despite being
born with male genitals,
a portion of this man's brain

765
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,065
is identical to a woman's?

766
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:42,435
Yes.

767
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:44,809
And in your expert opinion,

768
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,508
explain what this means
in Cheryl's case.

769
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:52,986
Cheryl feels Iike a woman
because her brain is
physiologically female.

770
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:54,213
Thank you, Doctor.

771
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:00,254
Referring to the defense's
Exhibit Three,

772
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,890
the stria terminalis
of a male-to-female
transsexual.

773
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:07,200
Is that a picture of
the defendant's brain?
PSYCHIATRIST: No.

774
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,363
These are photographs
of cadaver brains.

775
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:11,702
Why didn't you photograph
Cheryl Avery's brain?

776
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:14,834
The stria terminalis is only
accessible post mortem.

777
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:18,778
So as far as you know
Cheryl's stria terminalis
is the size of a man's

778
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:19,940
and she's not a transsexual.

779
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:21,040
Object, Your Honor.

780
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:24,018
LARSEN: Overruled.
Answer the question, Doctor.

781
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:28,012
I can't respond with
certainty either way.

782
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:31,319
Nothing further.

783
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:36,120
Let's talk about
the first time

784
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,861
you were assaulted
for dressing as a woman.

785
00:36:40,436 --> 00:36:42,097
How old were you?

786
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:43,229
Twelve.

787
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,674
And what happened?

788
00:36:46,742 --> 00:36:48,039
I was in

789
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,036
my room wearing
my mom's bra and skirt

790
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:52,842
when my brother's
friend walked in.

791
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:54,446
What did he do?

792
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:55,643
He Iaughed.

793
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:58,947
And he said he would
tell everyone.

794
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,147
Did he?

795
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:02,615
Yeah.

796
00:37:04,293 --> 00:37:05,453
In fact,
the next day at school

797
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:07,257
three boys came
in the bathroom

798
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,925
and they hit me
and they kicked me,

799
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,592
and spit on me.

800
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:15,102
How many times
have you been assaulted?

801
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:19,335
I've had my nose broken
and my shoulder dislocated

802
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:22,900
and once someone
set fire to my hair.

803
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:29,250
Cheryl, how have these
repeated attacks affected you?

804
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:32,649
I was scared to
Ieave the house.

805
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:36,523
But I had no choice when
my parents kicked me out.

806
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,061
And every time someone
Iooked at me, I wondered,

807
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,692
"Are they going to hurt me?
Are they going to...

808
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:49,969
"Is this going to be the time
that someone kills me?"

809
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:54,367
When Joe Cappilla
assaulted you,

810
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:56,434
this is what
you were feeling?

811
00:37:56,512 --> 00:37:57,570
Yes.

812
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,952
Your witness, Ms. Cabot.

813
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,816
So you thought your Iife
was in danger that night?

814
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:14,618
Yes.

815
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:18,198
Did anybody at the party
threaten you?

816
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:19,393
No, no.

817
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:24,295
Did anyone make
derogatory remarks
about transsexuals?

818
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:27,206
No, but why would they?
Nobody knew.

819
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,540
Had anyone at the party
ever hurt you before?

820
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:32,809
No. The only people
I knew there

821
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,009
were Joe and Eddie.

822
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:39,113
How Iong had you
been dating Eddie?

823
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,189
Two months.

824
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,387
Were you intimate?

825
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:47,255
Yeah.

826
00:38:48,597 --> 00:38:51,896
We kissed and fooled around,
but we never had sex.

827
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:55,033
Why not?

828
00:38:55,538 --> 00:38:57,005
Because I didn't want
Eddie to know

829
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,507
I hadn't had my surgery yet.

830
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:01,933
So you deceived him.

831
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,569
I had to.

832
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:07,810
What do you think
Eddie would have done
if he'd found out the truth?

833
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:11,216
I don't know.
Don't you?

834
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:15,951
You told Detective Benson
that you were afraid Eddie
was going to Ieave you.

835
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:18,357
In fact,
Eddie committed suicide
when he found out.

836
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:21,191
And I blame myself for that.

837
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:23,163
Do you blame yourself
for Joe's death?

838
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:28,064
I was protecting myself.

839
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,332
AII I wanted to do was
hit him over the head.

840
00:39:30,406 --> 00:39:35,343
If you hadn't killed him,
he would have told everyone
your secret when he came to.

841
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:37,669
Well, I wasn't thinking
that far ahead.

842
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,180
Weren't you?

843
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:42,981
Joe was going to tell Eddie,
and you couldn't
take that chance.

844
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,520
You were finally happy.
Eddie Ioved you.

845
00:39:45,588 --> 00:39:48,216
Well, Joe was gonna ruin that.

846
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,951
He was gonna ruin it,

847
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:51,754
and I couldn't Iet him do it.

848
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:54,625
I could not Iet him do it.
I had to stop him.

849
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:00,997
You did.

850
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:03,602
Nothing further.

851
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,316
Has the jury
reached the verdict?

852
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:17,545
We have, Your Honor.

853
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,986
LARSEN: Will the defendant
please rise?

854
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:26,561
On the sole count of murder
in the second degree,
how does the jury find?

855
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:29,898
We find the defendant

856
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,023
guilty.

857
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:35,931
PIease, please,
don't do this!

858
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:38,405
PIease, you can't
put me in that place!

859
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:41,534
PIease, help me, please.

860
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,272
Somebody! You can't
put me in that place!

861
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:52,245
Hey.

862
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:54,616
I'm heading out.
You want to grab a drink?

863
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,592
Thank you. But, you know,
I am just not in the mood.

864
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:02,290
Well, neither am I,
but I don't feel much
Iike going home.

865
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:06,564
Do you think I pushed
Cheryl too hard?

866
00:41:08,938 --> 00:41:10,667
You did your job.

867
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:14,234
Then why do I feel so Iousy?

868
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,710
Because you Iook at Cheryl,

869
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:25,147
and you can't imagine
what it's Iike to feel that
your own body is a mistake.

870
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:29,015
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

871
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,686
Benson.

872
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,592
We'II be right there.

873
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:36,522
What's up?

874
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:39,826
I gotta go to Bellevue.
You should come with me.

875
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,967
Special Victims Unit,
you called about
a rape victim.

876
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:49,670
They are taking him up
to surgery now.

877
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:53,007
CABOT: What happened?

878
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:55,346
Cheryl Avery was
gang-raped at Rikers.
