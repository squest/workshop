1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:00,063
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:04,765
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,932
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:09,034
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:12,638
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,181
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:18,082
LEN: I'm freezing.

8
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:20,314
JEFF: You want to warm up?
Paddle harder.

9
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:22,949
LEN: I must have been crazy
to Iet you talk me into this.

10
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:26,461
JEFF: Got to train early
to be in shape for the class
5 rapids this summer.

11
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,961
It's the middle
of winter!

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,828
Hasn't stopped anyone
from using the Hudson
as a garbage can.

13
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:36,293
Must've fallen
off a boat.

14
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,396
Maybe they Ieft us
a couple of brews.

15
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,773
Oh, my God!

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,376
We got a call
for child abuse.

17
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:48,814
Hope you haven't
had Iunch yet.

18
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:52,012
There's a special place
in hell for whoever did this.

19
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:53,577
STABLER: How old?

20
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:56,146
Haven't seen it,
but I heard newborn.

21
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,486
BENSON: Anyone touch anything?

22
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,787
Guy who found it
closed the Iid.

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,762
I know it's evidence,
but thank God
for small favors.

24
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:04,458
You can buy this
cooler anywhere
in town.

25
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,364
Look at this.

26
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:08,995
Perp must have put
something heavy in
the bag to weigh it down.

27
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:10,834
Bag breaks,
the cooler
floats up.

28
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:14,171
Got a partial Iogo.
Probably be able to
find the store from this.

29
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,369
PIease tell me this
isn't what I think.

30
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:17,776
Sorry.

31
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:19,074
Give me a minute.

32
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:24,512
Cooler could've been
dropped off the dock
or from a water taxi.

33
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,487
If you don't want your baby,
there are other options.

34
00:01:27,556 --> 00:01:30,753
Not for a girl who throws
her newborn in the river.

35
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:32,919
She's not a newborn.

36
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:34,552
How do you know?

37
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,598
Umbilical stump's gone.
She's at Ieast a month old.

38
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:32,913
One-month-old white female,
eight pounds, two ounces,
dead about a day.

39
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:34,285
She appears
well cared for.

40
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:37,348
Body scan shows
no sign of abuse
or neglect.

41
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,552
What was
the cause of death?

42
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:43,462
A Iethal dose of
tricyclic antidepressants.

43
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:46,160
Mother could have
been taking those
for postpartum depression.

44
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:49,670
Except that tricyclics
aren't prescribed
to nursing mothers.

45
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:51,968
There was breast milk
in the baby's stomach.

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,133
So she breast-fed
and bonded with this child.

47
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,109
That doesn't
sound Iike a woman
who would do this.

48
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:58,203
You got anything
that can Iead us
to the perp?

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,475
The cooler
can help.

50
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,643
No damage, so it wasn't
dropped from a great height,
Iike a bridge.

51
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,481
Take a Iook at this.

52
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:06,885
What is that, algae?

53
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:08,422
Or some other plant matter.

54
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,890
I also found
this on the corpse.

55
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,486
Sodium hypochlorite,
an industrial-strength
cleanser.

56
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,531
BENSON: So where do we
find that with algae?

57
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:17,929
No place I know of.

58
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,934
When we find the source,
maybe we find the dump site.

59
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,636
DR. QUEEN: ID'ing this
was a no-brainer.

60
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,505
It's Enteromorpha,
a common type of algae.

61
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:31,239
Very nutritious.
You can get it at
sushi restaurants.

62
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:33,008
I'II stick with
burgers and fries,
thanks.

63
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,981
Seaweed's healthier.

64
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,177
Come, take a Iook at this.

65
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,090
It's a map of
the Iower Hudson.

66
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,218
This is where
Enteromorpha
Iikes to grow.

67
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:49,161
So the cooler had to float
through one of these places
to pick it up.

68
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:52,358
And the sodium hypochlorite,
any idea how it got in
the water?

69
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:55,426
It's used by sewage
treatment plants
to disinfect waste

70
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,027
before it's put
into the river.

71
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,595
Well, there's a
treatment plant
on the Hudson,

72
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,334
right under
the Riverbank
State Park.

73
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,841
West 137.

74
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,311
Now, the cooler was found
all the way down here
in Battery Park.

75
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,779
Could it have
traveled that far?

76
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:08,110
Without a doubt.

77
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:11,118
These are the current patterns
the day the cooler was found.

78
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:13,017
I'II bet the cooler was
dropped into the water

79
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:15,784
somewhere along
this stretch of river,

80
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:19,315
and floated along this
current to Battery Park.

81
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:24,128
CRAGEN: We're talking a mile
or two stretch with direct
access to the river.

82
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,996
People come from all
over to picnic there.

83
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,898
Well, the bag on
the cooler narrows it down.

84
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:31,461
It came from The Bountiful
Earth health food store
about ten blocks away.

85
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,564
Perp probably stopped there,
maybe Iives nearby.

86
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:36,076
People who murder their
children usually report
them missing,

87
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,908
deflect suspicion
off themselves.

88
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,004
Any chance
it's a kidnap?

89
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,914
The infant was wrapped in
a blanket with the weights
on the outside of the cooler

90
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:44,815
to keep them form
crushing the baby.

91
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,218
This perp is definitely
someone with an emotional
connection.

92
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,916
Newborn murders are
usually the mother.

93
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,049
A one-month-old could
just as easily be the father.

94
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:54,118
If he had a reason to conceal
the pregnancy,
say, because of incest,

95
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:56,095
I doubt he would
have taken so Iong
to commit the crime.

96
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:57,893
I'm Ieaning
towards the mother.

97
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,730
Where would she
have kept the baby
hidden for a month?

98
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:03,965
Student away from
home fits the profile.

99
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,000
Hudson University.

100
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:08,099
It's just down the road
from the health food store.

101
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:10,906
We know roughly
when the baby
was conceived.

102
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,776
College is the best
Iead we've got.

103
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,183
I'm very sorry,
but our students have
a right to their privacy.

104
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:21,313
Who administers
the pregnancy
tests here?

105
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:24,381
Doesn't matter,
because you're not
going to talk to them.

106
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,086
You really want us
trolling your hallways

107
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,823
asking everyone
until we find who
we're Iooking for?

108
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:31,593
Our patients are usually
referred to the S.H.A.R.E.
desk.

109
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:34,895
S.H.A.R.E.?

110
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:38,871
Sexual Health and
Reproductive Education,
staffed by student volunteers.

111
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,103
They collect urine samples
and then they
send them to the Iab

112
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,405
for pregnancy tests.

113
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:45,002
So, they would
have all the names.

114
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,741
No, they'II have
the numbers.

115
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:48,681
It's anonymous.

116
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,775
Okay, so who
has the names?

117
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:52,183
I do.

118
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:56,349
So come back
with a court order
or don't come back at all.

119
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,788
CABOT: We don't even have
any proof the victim's mother
went to health services.

120
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:03,490
We understand that, AIex,
but this is our best shot.

121
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:05,965
Well, I need more evidence
before I can get a subpoena.

122
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,161
Sounds Iike you're
stonewalling us.

123
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,170
Yeah, what is this
really about?

124
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:12,832
OIivia, would you want
somebody digging through
your medical records?

125
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,171
I had a pregnancy
scare in college.
That was bad enough.

126
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,574
I can't imagine
the police knocking
at my door.

127
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,976
But this is
our best Iead.

128
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:22,278
Health Services at
Hudson has students
giving pregnancy tests.

129
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,374
So?

130
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,079
Judge in Iowa ruled
confidentiality
does not apply

131
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:28,315
when tests aren't performed
by doctors or nurses.

132
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,722
And PIanned Parenthood
fought the case so
hard on the course

133
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,225
that the county
finally had to drop it.

134
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:33,988
Still worth
giving a try.

135
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,360
AII right,
I'II run it
by my boss,

136
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:38,695
but I can tell right now
what she's going to say.

137
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:43,136
Someone killed a child.
It's our duty to
speak for the victim.

138
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,001
So now we're
the pregnancy police?

139
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:48,372
We're violating a woman's
rights for what amounts
to a Hail Mary.

140
00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:50,638
This isn't about
abortion rights, AIex.

141
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:53,180
We are talking about
a one-month-old infant.

142
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:55,808
Okay, so what if that
doesn't work, what are
we supposed to do?

143
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:59,047
Question every single woman
who bought an EPT
kit at the drugstore?

144
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,554
I'm afraid you're
missing the point.

145
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:04,148
We all worked hard to pass
the Baby Safe Haven Iaw.

146
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,386
That mother could have
dropped her child off
at any fire station,

147
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:08,793
any hospital,
without fear
of prosecution.

148
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,093
Instead,
she chose to murder.

149
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:16,834
So you're going to make
an example of her by taking
away women's privacy?

150
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,896
I'm not painting her
with a scarlet Ietter.

151
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,669
I'm just trying to
find this child's killer.

152
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,969
Well, a judge might
not see it that way.

153
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:28,243
Most still place
a pretty high value
on privacy rights.

154
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,185
We'II keep our
scope narrow.

155
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:34,278
Limit it to test results
from a two-month period.

156
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:38,416
Stipulate we'II rule out
women who already have
documented births on file.

157
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:40,586
AIex,

158
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:43,153
I want that Iist of names.

159
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,031
MUNCH: I don't Iike it.

160
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:49,592
The only reason we got
this Iist is because

161
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,969
Judge Hill is slightly
to the right of
Attila the Hun.

162
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,133
Why don't you give it
a rest? How many you got?

163
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,177
Twenty-four pregnant
college girls.

164
00:07:56,277 --> 00:08:00,008
And excuse me if I'm alarmed
by the total disregard for
human rights in this country.

165
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:03,244
If you got a problem with it,
why don't you get your bony
ass out of here?

166
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:08,321
Okay, out of two dozen
women with positive
pregnancy tests,

167
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,016
16 were issued
birth certificates.

168
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:12,992
That Ieaves eight suspects
with no reported baby.

169
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:15,086
Let's go invade
their privacy.

170
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,360
Can I help you?

171
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:23,734
Detectives Tutuola and Munch.
Is Angela Savvas here?

172
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:25,295
Angie's my wife.
What's this about?

173
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:26,806
We really should be
talking to both of you.

174
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,436
She's not feeling well
so you'II have
to speak with me.

175
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:32,241
Is your wife a student
at Hudson University?

176
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:33,644
A grad student, yeah.

177
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,684
We understand she found
out she was pregnant
nine months ago.

178
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,583
Unless that's a crime,
I don't see how it's
any of your business.

179
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:43,522
You remember
that abandoned baby
they found in the river?

180
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,786
We have reason to believe
that the mother
attended Hudson.

181
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,090
So now you're interrogating
every woman on campus?

182
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,926
Just those with positive
pregnancy tests and no child.

183
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,834
You're right,
we don't have a child.

184
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,963
My wife had
a miscarriage.

185
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:00,498
Sorry.

186
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,270
She went to
Presbyterian Hospital.

187
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:05,306
You want to see
the discharge papers?

188
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,677
That won't be necessary.

189
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,375
Then get the hell
out of here.

190
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,813
Cheer up.
Only three more to go.

191
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,287
Hi.
Hi.

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,520
Find what you're
Iooking for?

193
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,187
Actually, we were
Iooking for you.

194
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:24,026
EIIen Swanson?
Yes?

195
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:27,192
I'm Detective Benson.
This is my partner
Detective Stabler.

196
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:28,758
We'd Iike to talk
to you for a moment.

197
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,862
Sure. How did
you find me?

198
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,376
The Registrar said
this is where you
do your work-study.

199
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:37,968
Probably be best if we went
somewhere more private.

200
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,078
This is a mistake.
I've never been pregnant.

201
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,641
Health Services
says you tested
positive eight months ago.

202
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:47,552
They're wrong. I was in
Paris for a study abroad
eight months ago.

203
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,782
I just got back.

204
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,824
Could somebody in your dorm
have borrowed your ID

205
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:52,519
and then returned it
without your knowing?

206
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:53,959
I Iive in an
apartment alone.

207
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,359
I really have to
get back to work.

208
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,591
BENSON: Just one more thing.

209
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,532
We'd Iike a DNA
swab to rule you out.

210
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:01,728
No way.

211
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:06,399
You can't just go prying
into my private Iife and
then expect me to cooperate.

212
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:10,607
INS confirms
EIIen was in Paris
eight months ago.

213
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,737
Another necessary
invasion of privacy.

214
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:14,076
Well, not exactly.

215
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,446
She flew back here
for two weeks shortly
after she got there.

216
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,781
Let me guess.
She had a pregnancy test
as soon as she got home.

217
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:19,911
BENSON: The day after.

218
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:22,320
Probably realized she was
pregnant and came home
to deal with it.

219
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,584
Boyfriend says all
the right things,

220
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,853
she goes back to Paris
thinking they're one
big happy family.

221
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:28,657
When she returns,
he's changed his mind.

222
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,895
Too Iate to get an abortion,
afraid to tell her parents.

223
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,433
So she has the kid at home,

224
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,969
she spends a month
trying to figure out
how to get rid of it.

225
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:37,629
Does that play?

226
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,437
Enough to get
a warrant.

227
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:44,070
You're wrong about this.
I told you, I've never
been pregnant.

228
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,635
Just Iike you told us
that Health Services

229
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,375
never gave you a pregnancy
test because you were
in Paris.

230
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,280
Why won't you believe me?

231
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,819
Because your story
doesn't match the facts.

232
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:55,151
Look what we have here.

233
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:58,192
She shops at
The Bountiful Earth.
Very health-conscious.

234
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,853
Everyone on campus
shops there.

235
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:04,830
Dumbbells usually come
in pairs. Where's the other
20-pounder?

236
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,197
I Iost it moving in.

237
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:10,531
EIIiot.

238
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,177
From Conception to Delivery:
A First-Time Mother's Guide.

239
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:20,112
This receipt shows
that you bought that book

240
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:23,344
the day after
that pregnancy test
you never took.

241
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:31,248
I haven't done
anything wrong.

242
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,919
Then take a DNA test
and clear this
whole thing up.

243
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:34,984
No.
STABLER: Fine.

244
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:36,758
We have enough evidence
for a court order.

245
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:41,793
Positive pregnancy test,
a how-to book for
expectant mothers,

246
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,564
a bag that
matches the bag...

247
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:44,696
Stop...

248
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,296
Used to weigh
down the cooler.

249
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:47,841
Oh, my God.

250
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:53,042
What happened, EIIen?

251
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,975
I don't know...

252
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,347
STABLER: Just tell us.

253
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:01,154
I'm telling you,
you'II feel better.
Just tell us.

254
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,226
It wasn't me.

255
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,061
BENSON: Well,
who was it, then?

256
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,860
My sister, Patty.
She's only 15.

257
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,536
So, you gave her your
college ID to get tested
so no one would find out.

258
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,898
She panicked.
She needed me.

259
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:24,274
That's why I came
back from Paris.

260
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:26,438
STABLER: Why didn't she
go to your parents?

261
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,379
You don't know my dad.

262
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,781
So what did she tell you?

263
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:32,820
That she was going
to have the baby.

264
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:34,616
BENSON: Did she say
who the father was?

265
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,283
Her ex-boyfriend,
Paul Howley.

266
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:42,489
He's older,
works for some
maintenance company.

267
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:45,259
So you went
back to Paris.

268
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,733
And what happened
when you came home?

269
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,565
There was no baby.

270
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,537
Patty said
the test was wrong,

271
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,836
that she never wanted
to talk about it again.

272
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:58,273
Then when I heard about
the baby in the cooler...

273
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:06,045
You have to understand,
she was so scared,
and she's just a kid.

274
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,088
Patty could have kept her baby
at her boyfriend's apartment.

275
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,059
Until playing daddy
Iost its novelty.

276
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:14,355
Then she had to
figure out what to do.

277
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,396
She's a minor. Bring
her in with her parents.

278
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:18,955
Father's some
corporate big shot.

279
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:22,560
He's flying in from D.C.
Mother's a homemaker.
Still no answer.

280
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:25,003
EIIen says she runs
errands this time of day.

281
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,403
Thank you.

282
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,772
Teacher at Patty's school says
she got an emergency page,

283
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:30,970
Ieft the classroom to answer,
never came back.

284
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,275
Big sister EIIen
must have warned her.

285
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,247
School's faxing
over a yearbook photo.

286
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,716
Maybe Patty's boyfriend
can help us find her.

287
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,058
I haven't seen
Patty in eight months.
She broke up with me.

288
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:46,991
She dumped you
or did you kick
her to the curb

289
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:49,256
when you found out
she was going to
make you a daddy?

290
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,319
She was pregnant?

291
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,866
Let me guess,
you didn't always
practice safe sex?

292
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,734
We never had sex.
She was too young.

293
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:57,964
How old were you
eight months ago?

294
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,131
Seventeen.

295
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:01,266
Well, that wasn't
statutory rape,
so spill it.

296
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:02,832
Did you have
sex with Patty?

297
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:05,411
Yes.
You hit it raw?

298
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:08,581
Well, a couple of times
we didn't use protection.

299
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,982
But she never said
anything about
being pregnant.

300
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:13,918
What did I do?

301
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:16,548
You heard about
that baby we found
in the river?

302
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:17,648
You think she was mine?

303
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,285
We can find out
if you'II Iet us
run a DNA test.

304
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,691
No problem.

305
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:25,724
I would have
supported Patty
and the baby.

306
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,931
I got a union job now,
I make a good buck.

307
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,972
If you would have stepped up,
why do you think
she didn't tell you?

308
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,906
Her father.
The guy's a
world class jerk.

309
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,769
He hates me because
I'm a dropout.

310
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:39,676
Any idea where
we can find Patty?

311
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,545
If she's not at
home or at school,
I really don't know.

312
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,949
How about paging her?
You still got the number?

313
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,111
Yeah, I remember it.

314
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:48,280
Call it. Tell her
to meet you.

315
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:58,062
Patty Swanson?

316
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,798
PIease don't tell
my parents.

317
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,067
PIease.

318
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,303
You're pregnant?

319
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:16,180
No, Daddy.
Not anymore.

320
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,512
You stupid slut.

321
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:18,677
STABLER: Mr. Swanson.

322
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:20,015
What, you just
spread your Iegs

323
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,282
for the first dropout punk
who comes sniffing around?

324
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,688
Sir, calm down.

325
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:26,725
Calm down.

326
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:29,160
BENSON: We know you didn't
mean to hurt anyone.

327
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,324
For God's sake,
Patty, what happened?

328
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,895
I killed my baby.

329
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,569
God, I killed my baby.
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

330
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:42,904
What did you do?

331
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,239
What?

332
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:51,175
I went to this place
on 96th Street.

333
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,053
A clinic?

334
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,748
Yes.

335
00:15:57,793 --> 00:16:00,660
I'm so sorry.
I just didn't know
where else to go.

336
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:03,163
You had an abortion?
Without my permission?

337
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,721
The Iaw says that
she doesn't need it.

338
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,926
Like hell she doesn't!

339
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:09,095
I've asked you to calm down.
Now I'm telling you
to sit down.

340
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:12,201
Sit down.

341
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,510
Patty, we're going
to need your okay

342
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:22,277
to check this
story with the clinic,
all right?

343
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:24,616
AII right.

344
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:32,516
How'd it go?

345
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:34,494
Only crime here is
that her father's a prick.

346
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:35,962
And a wife beater.

347
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,330
What did you say?

348
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,994
Swanson has half a dozen
domestic violence collars.

349
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,297
His wife never
pressed charges,

350
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:44,805
but the Iocal precinct
knows their address by heart.

351
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:50,741
Listen to me, Detective.

352
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:52,177
If you ever speak
to me that way again,

353
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:55,080
I'II make damn sure
the Police Commissioner
hears about it.

354
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,481
We play golf together.

355
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,052
Does he know
about your handicap?

356
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,611
My handicap?

357
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:02,520
The one that makes you
slap your wife around.

358
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,657
Well, good,
I've got
your attention.

359
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:11,659
You raise your hand to her
or your daughters again,

360
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:13,901
I'II be paying
you a visit.

361
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,197
Is that a threat?

362
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:19,467
Yeah.

363
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:21,072
Roger?

364
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,716
CIinic confirmed
Patty's abortion.

365
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:36,647
So we turned her
world upside down
for nothing.

366
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,215
Another good
day's work.

367
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,854
I heard what you
said to the father.

368
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,123
I meant every
word of that.

369
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:51,101
Wow, you Iook Iike
you Ieft somebody alone
at a very nice place.

370
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:54,336
My husband will wait.
This couldn't.
It's about the baby.

371
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:55,467
What's wrong?

372
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:58,741
During the autopsy,
I noticed her retinas had
a reddish discoloration,

373
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:02,409
so I ordered several
genetic tests.
One came back positive.

374
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:04,076
What for?
Tay-Sachs.

375
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:05,710
No treatment or cure.

376
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:08,153
She'd have died
a horrible death
by the age of five.

377
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:11,251
This was a mercy killing.

378
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:19,059
So, this changes the profile.

379
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:20,795
Instead of Iooking
for one parent,

380
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,997
we're probably
Iooking for a couple,
reasonably well-off,

381
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:26,097
responsible enough
to get medical care
for their baby.

382
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,005
Explains why
she's a month old.

383
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:31,204
Mother probably never thought
of doing this until she found
out the baby was sick.

384
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,474
People Iike this,
they wouldn't have
kept their kid a secret.

385
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:36,608
No, but they're
probably covering up
her disappearance.

386
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,653
They might have relocated
at the time of her death,

387
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,620
or reported her
missing in another state.

388
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:42,953
I'II check with the Center
for Missing and
Exploited Children.

389
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:45,822
In the meantime,
any idea how we can
pick up their trail?

390
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:48,488
Yeah. Tay-Sachs is most common
among certain ethnic groups,

391
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:50,622
particularly
the Jewish community.

392
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:53,497
Same old story.
When all else fails,
round up the Jews.

393
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:56,628
It's also common among
French-Canadians and Cajuns.

394
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:00,402
Genetic screening has
drastically reduced the number
of Tay-Sachs babies.

395
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:04,343
Both parents need to carry
the gene and they were
probably never tested.

396
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,141
If I had a kid with
some rare disease,

397
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:08,682
first thing I'd do
is find a doctor who
specializes in it.

398
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:15,183
DR. KLEIN: It's a horrible
disease, worse than most
parents can possibly bear.

399
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,690
And how close
are you to a cure?

400
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,282
Years away.

401
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,328
Tay-Sachs patients
are missing a key enzyme.

402
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:22,920
Without it,
a fatty substance
builds up in the brain,

403
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:26,559
causing progressive Ioss
of function and eventually
death.

404
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:29,433
Would our victim have
shown any symptoms?

405
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:32,439
Nothing the parents
would have noticed
until about six months.

406
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,372
Then why did they
have their baby tested?

407
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,569
The cherry-red spots
in the eyes your M.E. found

408
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:39,136
can appear as early as
two days after birth.

409
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:42,274
Any pediatrician
could have spotted them
during a well-baby checkup.

410
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,942
Do you have any patients
who died suddenly

411
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,953
or missed appointments,
haven't come back?

412
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,649
My work is in research.
I don't treat
these children myself.

413
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:51,317
But even if I did,
you know I couldn't
tell you about them.

414
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:55,295
Okay. Are there any places
the parents can go for help?

415
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:56,354
Fortunately,
this disease is rare.

416
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,366
There's only one
support group in the area.

417
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,198
Not everybody
comes to every meeting.

418
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,965
We get people from
as far away as Maine.

419
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,442
But these parents
would probably be Iocal,
child born about a month ago.

420
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:09,801
There was a woman
from Manhattan.

421
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:13,645
Came to a meeting
a few weeks ago,
but never came back.

422
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:15,047
Any idea why?

423
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:18,109
She seemed disturbed when
she saw the child of one
of our parents.

424
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:19,313
Can't say I blame her.

425
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:20,480
STABLER: Do you
remember her name?

426
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:21,580
Sorry.

427
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:25,525
Well, what about
a Iist of members or
a sign-in sheet?

428
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:27,358
Can't give that out.

429
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,160
Rabbi, we're pretty
sure that the parents

430
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:34,363
that we're Iooking
for murdered their baby
because she had Tay-Sachs.

431
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:35,631
Oh, God.

432
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:36,797
And with all due respect,

433
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:39,966
there is no Iaw protecting
the confidentiality
of support groups.

434
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:43,637
I'm only trying to protect
what Iittle solace the members
of this group have Ieft.

435
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:47,749
I'm sorry,
we'II have to
get a subpoena.

436
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:48,909
Okay.

437
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:51,178
Okay.

438
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:57,818
Here's the Iist.
I'II fax you
the sign-in sheets.

439
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:01,693
But there's no guarantee
the woman you're Iooking for
is going to be on any of them.

440
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:04,665
We don't require
parents to sign in,
or even tell us who they are.

441
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:07,168
Do you remember anything
else about this woman?

442
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:10,399
Where she Iived,
who referred her?

443
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:12,031
Now that you
mention it, yes.

444
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,076
Her pediatrician,
Judah PIatner, sent her.

445
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,272
He belongs to
our congregation.

446
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,511
We're not asking for records.
We're asking for the name
of the woman

447
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,516
you referred to
the Tay-Sachs support group.

448
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,552
That's the same thing,
isn't it?

449
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:26,144
Besides, I haven't
had a Tay-Sachs patient
in a couple of years.

450
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:28,156
Rabbi Birnbaum
mentioned you by name.

451
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:30,488
Yes, I know.
He visits patients
here all the time.

452
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,424
It's easy enough to mix me up
with another pediatrician.

453
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:35,123
Dr. PIatner, a child has
been murdered. If you know
anything at all...

454
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:36,255
I would tell you.

455
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:38,857
The Iaw requires me
to report any abuse
of a child.

456
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:41,402
Have you had any
patients die recently?

457
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,438
Yes. A five-year old boy.

458
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:45,371
Neuroblastoma.
Just Iast month.

459
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:48,905
It doesn't happen often
but it never gets any easier.

460
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:50,673
Any you've sent
for genetic testing?

461
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,839
Detective, stop wasting
your time and mine.

462
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:54,678
Believe me,
I'd help you if I could.

463
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:59,021
National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children came
up with squat.

464
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:02,421
Same with Missing Persons
in all five boroughs and
the rest of the Tri-State.

465
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:05,392
Mother goes to
a support group.
She gets the kid tested.

466
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:08,157
You've got all of
this media coverage...

467
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,631
Someone who knows them is not
suspicious that this baby
is gone missing?

468
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,464
I mean, why hasn't
anyone reported them?

469
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:16,232
Because everybody
knows the baby died.
They just don't know how.

470
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:17,795
Yeah, and somehow
they covered it up.

471
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:19,704
Maybe with help from
your Dr. PIatner.

472
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:21,106
What'd you find?

473
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:24,044
Vital Stats had
the death certificate
on a cancer patient,

474
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:26,980
but he signed
one just Iast week
on a month-old girl.

475
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,279
Funny how he forgot
to tell us that.
Cause of death?

476
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:30,819
Asphyxiation Pneumonia.

477
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:34,447
Little girl's
name was Sarah Brown.
Parents, Andrea and Daniel.

478
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:38,657
The funeral was Wednesday.
We're still sitting shiva.

479
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:40,559
We're very sorry
for your Ioss.

480
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:42,392
We'II take as Iittle of
your time as possible.

481
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:45,332
Dr. PIatner was
Sarah's pediatrician,
wasn't he?

482
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:47,426
Yes, but how would
you know that?

483
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:49,494
BENSON: We have a Iist
of all his patients.

484
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,570
What exactly
is this about?

485
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,972
We're investigating
a complaint against
Dr. PIatner

486
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:56,603
and we're following up
with all of his
patients' parents.

487
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,544
I'm sorry,
may I use
the bathroom?

488
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:01,708
Sure, it's through
the bedroom.
Pardon the mess.

489
00:23:46,996 --> 00:23:48,020
Anything?

490
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:51,498
Not in the medicine cabinet,
but there was an empty vial
in the garbage can.

491
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:53,091
Something called
Imipramine.

492
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:55,134
I've never heard of it.
When was it filled?

493
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:58,105
Last week,
two days before
the baby turned up.

494
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,506
For Andrea Richman.
Must be her maiden name.

495
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:03,340
Prescribed by Dr. PIatner.

496
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:09,942
Well, how often does
a pediatrician write a
prescription for the parents?

497
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:15,051
The M.E. confirmed
Imipramine is the
tricyclic antidepressant

498
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:16,284
that caused
Sarah Brown's death.

499
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,690
Parents probably
used what they needed
to put the baby to sleep

500
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,058
and flushed the rest
down the toilet.

501
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:21,687
If the doctor gave
them the pills to do this,

502
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:23,664
he's just as guilty
as the Browns are.

503
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:25,964
I'II get a warrant to
pick up that pill vial.

504
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,731
Our baby was
found in a cooler.

505
00:24:28,804 --> 00:24:31,034
Are we saying these parents
buried an empty casket?

506
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:35,008
I checked out
the funeral home
that the Browns used.

507
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:37,136
There are
multiple Health
Department violations.

508
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:38,510
The Browns could
have paid them off.

509
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:41,015
Why dump the body
in the river?
Why not just bury it?

510
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,108
We're not going to know
until the parents give it up.

511
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:46,120
We can't prove the Browns
are the parents without
their DNA.

512
00:24:46,188 --> 00:24:48,156
Which we can't get
without more evidence.

513
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:50,055
We got the pill bottle.

514
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,956
Is that enough to
dig up the kid's grave?

515
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,769
I'II run tests
on the Iining,

516
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:12,712
but I'm pretty sure
there's never been
a body in this coffin.

517
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:16,208
I see a selfless act
of mercy, not a murder.

518
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:17,946
STABLER: The Iaw doesn't
make that distinction,
Counselor.

519
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,385
The jury will.
They'II never convict.

520
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:21,582
Juries don't Iike defendants
who kill their own children.

521
00:25:21,657 --> 00:25:24,717
If this was Dr. PIatner's
idea and you agree to
testify against him...

522
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:27,455
It was my idea.
But I couldn't
bear to hurt Sarah.

523
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,656
So you had your
husband do it?

524
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:29,789
He had nothing
to do with this.

525
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:31,833
Andrea, please,
don't say anything else.

526
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:33,459
No, I need to tell them.
I didn't know what to do,

527
00:25:33,536 --> 00:25:35,629
so I asked
Dr. PIatner for help.

528
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:38,104
And you wrote
Andrea the prescription.

529
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:40,141
Nothing could
have saved Sarah.

530
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:42,177
I've seen many
children die.

531
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:44,474
Children born without brains,
riddled with cancer.

532
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:46,447
This time,
at Ieast I was
able to do something

533
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:47,812
before that
Iittle girl suffered.

534
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:49,009
What about your oath?

535
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:53,145
To do no harm?
I couldn't even
make Sarah comfortable.

536
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:55,520
Her mother wanted to spare
her years of torture.

537
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:58,049
Now, would it have been
Iess harmful to make her
go through that?

538
00:25:58,128 --> 00:26:00,153
The jury will see him
as an angel of mercy.

539
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,754
Or an angel of death.

540
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:04,391
Our version goes
down a Iot smoother.

541
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:09,134
We'II consider a plea
if there's no time involved.

542
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:11,139
Your client provided
the murder weapon.

543
00:26:11,207 --> 00:26:12,435
We're not going
to send the message

544
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,170
that you can kill
a terminally ill child

545
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:15,939
and get off with
a slap on the wrist.

546
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,140
STABLER: You're Iooking
at 25-years-to-Iife.

547
00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:19,647
EMMETT: Not after
the jury hears her story.

548
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:21,308
You fed Sarah the drugs.

549
00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:25,013
DNA proves that
Iittle girl in the river
is your daughter.

550
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,282
She was my baby.

551
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,056
You could never
know how hard this was.

552
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,257
Instead of suffering,

553
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,834
she just went
peacefully to sleep.

554
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,904
It's still murder.

555
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,013
You're not testifying?

556
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:57,951
I have a personal interest.

557
00:26:58,021 --> 00:26:59,352
Sitting on
the defense's side?

558
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:01,185
Oh, ye of Iittle faith.

559
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,692
I assumed that you
were pro-euthanasia.

560
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,819
Yeah, for adults who are
competent to ask for it.

561
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:07,055
But not for children?

562
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,497
First kids with incurable
diseases, then the disabled.
Where does it stop?

563
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:14,499
Defense is going to argue that
Andrea did this out of Iove.

564
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:17,301
It doesn't matter
what intentions this
road is paved with, AIex,

565
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,467
it only Ieads
to one place.

566
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:29,045
I was Andrea's pediatrician
since the day she was born.

567
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,384
But you were more
than just her doctor,
weren't you?

568
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:35,424
Well, Andrea's father, Joel,
died when she was about 1 2.

569
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:38,393
I was sort of her
surrogate father
while she was growing up.

570
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:42,989
We Iost touch from the time
she went to college until
Sarah was born.

571
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:45,261
AHRENS: How did you Iearn
that Sarah was sick?

572
00:27:45,335 --> 00:27:48,099
At her two-week checkup,
I saw the red spots
in her eyes.

573
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:50,696
I told Andrea she had
to get the girl tested.

574
00:27:50,774 --> 00:27:53,242
And when the results
of those tests came back?

575
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:56,608
I told Andrea and Daniel
their child had Tay-Sachs.

576
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,810
They felt terrible guilt
because they had not been
tested themselves.

577
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:02,749
AHRENS: Did you tell
them what Sarah faced?

578
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:03,877
Yes, I did.

579
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:05,113
Would you tell us?

580
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:08,282
At about six months,
Sarah would start
having seizures.

581
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:11,953
Her vision would
progressively deteriorate
until she went blind.

582
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:14,087
Her brain function
would slowly disappear.

583
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:16,826
She would Iose
the ability to sit up
and swallow.

584
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:22,067
She would need
a feeding tube
to stay alive.

585
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:27,132
I told Andrea and
Daniel that their
beautiful Iittle child

586
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,704
would die a terrible death
before she was five.

587
00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:33,442
How did they
take the news?

588
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:35,541
As bad as
you would expect.

589
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:38,849
They couldn't stand
the thought of Sarah
suffering and then Iosing her.

590
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:41,857
Doctor, at any time
did you advise Andrea

591
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:44,985
or Daniel Brown to
euthanize their daughter?

592
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,119
Absolutely not.

593
00:28:46,196 --> 00:28:48,494
Then why did you
prescribe the tricyclics

594
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:50,795
that Andrea used to
put Sarah to sleep?

595
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:55,133
Andrea said that she was going
to euthanize Sarah with me
or without me.

596
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:57,901
You see, I knew what Sarah
was going to go through.

597
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:01,501
I just wanted it to be as
painless as possible for
both of them.

598
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:02,977
Thank you, Doctor.

599
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,545
No questions
for this witness.

600
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:13,117
Dr. PIatner, when you agreed
to help Andrea Brown
kill her daughter...

601
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:14,281
No, no, no.
That's not what I said.

602
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:15,915
PIease Iet me finish, Doctor.

603
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:17,983
Did you ever talk to
her husband, Daniel?

604
00:29:18,795 --> 00:29:20,387
No, I didn't.

605
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:22,624
But he was Sarah's father.

606
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:26,032
Andrea would have never
done this if it wasn't
what they both wanted.

607
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:30,740
You also falsified
the death certificate,
didn't you?

608
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,206
Yes, I did.

609
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:36,239
Did you also advise Andrea
to dump Sarah's body
in the Hudson River?

610
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:37,301
No, no, of course not.

611
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,214
Then why did you arrange
for the funeral home
to bury an empty casket?

612
00:29:41,284 --> 00:29:45,687
Andrea was supposed to call me
when Sarah had gone to sleep.
But she panicked.

613
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:48,622
She didn't come to me
until after she had already
put Sarah in the river.

614
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:50,591
CABOT: And you helped
her cover it up?

615
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:53,294
Yes, I did.

616
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:56,261
Dr. PIatner, do you
think that children

617
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,596
who have no
chance of survival
should be euthanized?

618
00:29:58,668 --> 00:30:00,226
Objection.
Overruled.

619
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,100
Have you ever seen
a child with Tay-Sachs?

620
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:03,901
Or any fatal disease?

621
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:07,500
And how would we
determine the criteria
for killing a child?

622
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:09,602
Those born with half a brain?

623
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,510
Deaf children?
BIind children, maybe?

624
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:12,843
Is this necessary,
Your Honor?

625
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:14,975
You've made your point,
Miss Cabot. Move on.

626
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:18,510
Dr. PIatner,
for how many other patients
have you ended the suffering?

627
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:19,680
None.

628
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:21,155
Then why did you
do it in this case?

629
00:30:22,358 --> 00:30:24,189
Sarah was hopeless.

630
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,023
I was Iike
a father to Andrea.

631
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:28,120
I couldn't Iet this
destroy her, too.

632
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:33,094
Nothing further.

633
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,901
Daniel had to
work Iate that night.

634
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:45,444
I crushed the pills,

635
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:47,980
I put them in some formula.

636
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:51,612
I nursed her one Iast time,

637
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:54,547
and then I gave
Sarah the bottle.

638
00:30:54,624 --> 00:30:56,489
And I...

639
00:30:57,126 --> 00:31:02,154
I held her and I watched her
as she peacefully drifted
off to sleep.

640
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:07,133
Tell the jury
what happened next.

641
00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:08,534
I Iost it.

642
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,670
I was supposed
to call Judah...

643
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:15,506
Dr. PIatner, but...

644
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:19,648
I put Sarah in the car
and I just drove.

645
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:22,913
I went to the river
and stopped at a place

646
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:25,352
where Daniel and I
used to picnic.

647
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:28,181
Did you call your husband?

648
00:31:28,258 --> 00:31:29,282
No.

649
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,226
I didn't want him
to see our baby Iike that.

650
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:33,922
EMMETT: What did you do?

651
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:36,765
I put the

652
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:41,368
tire iron into the grocery
sack, I tied it around the

653
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:43,733
handle.

654
00:31:44,841 --> 00:31:46,365
I wrapped Sarah

655
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:49,841
in a blanket and I...

656
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,448
And I put her inside and

657
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:54,978
I placed it on the water

658
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:59,385
and I just... I
watched while
it disappeared.

659
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:03,085
Andrea,

660
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,685
you had other alternatives,
didn't you?

661
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:10,756
There was a support group
that Judah recommended.

662
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:17,068
And I went and I
Iistened to the parents
discuss their kids.

663
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:20,899
They can't move.
They can't see.

664
00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:22,968
It made me even
more determined
to do what I did.

665
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:24,138
Why?

666
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:26,977
Because I Ioved
Sarah so much.

667
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,575
I could not stand
to see her suffer.

668
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,279
Nothing further.

669
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:38,585
Sarah wasn't
showing any symptoms
of Tay-Sachs.

670
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:41,495
Why didn't you
wait until she did?

671
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:43,532
I didn't want her
to be in any pain.

672
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,126
Wasn't this as
much about your pain
as it was Sarah's?

673
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:49,694
I did it to
spare Sarah,
not me.

674
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:53,435
I will be in agony
for the rest of my Iife.

675
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,969
You testified that you
went to the support
group by yourself.

676
00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:59,947
Where was your husband?

677
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:04,546
I didn't think he
could handle it.

678
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,386
Dr. PIatner said
that you both wanted
to end Sarah's Iife

679
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:11,825
and yet you told detectives
that your husband
wasn't involved.

680
00:33:12,562 --> 00:33:15,429
Why did you make
this decision
on your own?

681
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,230
I didn't want Daniel
to be the one who did it.

682
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:28,076
I know what I did
was against the Iaw.

683
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:30,908
But I believe
in a Ioving God.

684
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:34,982
And I cannot believe
that a Ioving God

685
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:38,316
would want an innocent child
to suffer so horribly.

686
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:50,792
(CHATTERING)

687
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:55,302
Miss Cabot.

688
00:33:56,606 --> 00:33:58,369
Your client seems upset.
What's going on?

689
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:00,432
Dr. PIatner asked
me to talk to you.

690
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,875
Why?

691
00:34:01,944 --> 00:34:03,912
He wants to make a deal.

692
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:06,643
In return for what?

693
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,480
I've already testified,
Ms. Cabot.

694
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:12,280
Believe me,
I'm not hiding anything.

695
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,780
I did what I had to do
for Andrea and Sarah.

696
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:17,553
What happened to
your noble intentions,

697
00:34:17,627 --> 00:34:20,027
alleviating the suffering
of dying children?

698
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,927
I've been taking
care of children
for almost 40 years.

699
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,968
If I'm convicted,
I'II die in prison.

700
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:29,201
What are you Iooking for?

701
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:30,864
Man two, five-to-15.

702
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,376
And this doesn't have anything
to do with the fireworks
I witnessed after court today?

703
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:35,968
There isn't anything
that my client knows

704
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:38,013
that he hasn't
told you or the jury.

705
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:40,479
And he may very
well be acquitted.

706
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:43,282
You didn't Iet PIatner
cop a plea, did you?

707
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:45,047
We told him
we'd sleep on it.

708
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:47,919
AII that posturing about
euthanasia and now he
just wants to give up?

709
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,321
What's he
really afraid of?

710
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:51,257
I'm not sure,
but PIatner Iooked
pretty surprised

711
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:54,353
when Andrea testified
she never told her husband
what she was going to do.

712
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,160
This was the most
important decision
of their Iives.

713
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,530
How could she
not include him?

714
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,069
She said she didn't
want Daniel to be
the one who did it.

715
00:35:01,137 --> 00:35:02,570
Maybe she was
protecting him.

716
00:35:02,638 --> 00:35:04,128
Not from us.

717
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:07,301
Even if he was involved,
the only proof of that
would be Andrea's testimony

718
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:09,810
and spousal privilege
puts that off Iimits.

719
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:11,972
Well, maybe Andrea
was protecting him
from the truth.

720
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:13,140
About what?

721
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:15,150
Every Jewish couple I know
got tested for Tay-Sachs

722
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:16,617
before they walked
down the aisle.

723
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:18,551
Why would an educated
couple Iike the Browns

724
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:20,111
roll the dice and
take those chances?

725
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:23,056
Because they thought there
was no chance they could
have a Tay-Sachs baby.

726
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:25,492
If Danny wasn't born Jewish,
he'd got better odds
at hitting the Iottery

727
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:27,461
than carrying
the Tay-Sachs gene.

728
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:29,992
What kind of offer
requires the presence

729
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:32,762
of the defendant's
husband but not her?

730
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:34,166
No offer.

731
00:35:34,237 --> 00:35:37,764
We have a court order
for a DNA test
for Mr. Brown.

732
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,432
What the hell for?

733
00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:41,807
We checked your
birth certificate.

734
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,573
You were born Catholic.

735
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:48,140
Yes, but I converted to
Judaism before Andrea and I
got married. So what?

736
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:52,210
So there's very Iittle
chance that you carry
the Tay-Sachs gene.

737
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:55,146
(SIGHS)

738
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:57,382
You can't do this.

739
00:35:58,194 --> 00:36:00,094
I know my rights.
Spousal privilege.

740
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:02,961
Husbands and wives
can't incriminate
each other.

741
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,831
Well, that's not
entirely true.

742
00:36:06,335 --> 00:36:09,168
Communication between
spouses is protected.

743
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:12,065
But the privilege
doesn't cover DNA.

744
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,171
We can take you to
the M.E.'s office
right now for the DNA test.

745
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:22,114
Don't waste your time.

746
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,213
I'm

747
00:36:25,354 --> 00:36:27,618
not Sarah's
biological father.

748
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,091
Andrea told you,
didn't she?

749
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:38,629
About the affair.

750
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:40,669
After she was arrested.

751
00:36:40,736 --> 00:36:44,001
But I suspected something
when Sarah was diagnosed.

752
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:49,774
It was with some
guy in her office.

753
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:53,578
How do you know
she wasn't just trying

754
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:56,083
to cover up the affair
when she killed Sarah?

755
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:03,523
Because she Ioved
that child more than
anything in the world.

756
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:10,026
CABOT: PIease state your
name for the record.

757
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,794
Steven Kellerman.

758
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:14,267
Mr. Kellerman,
how do you know
the defendant?

759
00:37:14,337 --> 00:37:16,202
I worked with her.

760
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:19,070
What was the extent
of your relationship?

761
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,775
I'm not sure
what that means.

762
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:24,335
Did you have sex
with Andrea Brown?

763
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,477
It only happened once
after we'd worked Iate.
Her husband was away.

764
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:34,546
After that, you transferred
to a different office,
didn't you?

765
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:36,148
To Boston, yes.

766
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:41,028
When did you become
aware that Andrea Brown
was pregnant with your child?

767
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:43,292
When I read about
the case in the newspaper.

768
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:46,767
So you're saying
you never even knew
about your own daughter?

769
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:47,928
Yes.

770
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:50,864
Nothing further.

771
00:37:56,112 --> 00:37:57,340
Who ended the affair?

772
00:37:57,413 --> 00:38:00,405
Andrea did,
immediately after it began.

773
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:03,748
I Ioved her,
but she Ioved
her husband

774
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:05,309
and she had
a moment of weakness...

775
00:38:05,388 --> 00:38:08,949
Objection!
Mr. Kellerman is not here
as a character witness.

776
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:11,357
Sustained.
Jury will disregard.

777
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:15,693
When you read about
Andrea in the newspaper,
why didn't you come forward?

778
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,430
Because I had a brother
that died of Tay-Sachs and
I've seen what that does.

779
00:38:21,837 --> 00:38:24,772
And if I'd been in Andrea's
position, I would have done
the same thing.

780
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:28,067
I'm very sorry.

781
00:38:35,284 --> 00:38:38,276
Andrea Brown's actions
had one purpose.

782
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:41,114
One.

783
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:47,858
To spare the child she Ioved
years of horrible agony,

784
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,296
Ieading to
an inevitable death.

785
00:38:55,237 --> 00:38:58,604
When you go into
the jury room,
Iadies and gentlemen,

786
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:04,538
you must decide if this woman
deserves to go to prison
for at Ieast 25 years.

787
00:39:05,214 --> 00:39:07,079
But before you
answer that question,

788
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:09,617
ask one of yourselves,

789
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,287
"If this were my child,

790
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:15,684
"what would I do?"

791
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:19,190
And if that question
gives you pause,

792
00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:22,662
I pray you decide
that Andrea Brown
has already suffered enough.

793
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:38,340
Andrea Brown ground up a
Iethal dose of antidepressants
and fed it to her baby.

794
00:39:40,383 --> 00:39:43,716
The defense doesn't
dispute these facts,
but they argue

795
00:39:43,786 --> 00:39:46,846
Mrs. Brown acted out of
the noblest of motives.

796
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,817
Let's examine these motives.

797
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:53,988
Andrea Brown had
an extramarital affair
and got pregnant.

798
00:39:56,031 --> 00:39:59,228
When she found out the baby
wasn't her husband's,
did she tell him?

799
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:01,494
No.

800
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:05,033
Did she tell Steve Kellerman
that he was the father?

801
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:07,603
No.

802
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:11,145
Did she tell Dr. PIatner,
when pressuring him
for a prescription,

803
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:13,943
an act she knew
could Iand him in prison?

804
00:40:15,084 --> 00:40:16,142
No.

805
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:20,649
From the start,
Andrea Brown's
primary concern

806
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:23,920
was preserving her
marriage, her image,

807
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:27,360
and her Iifestyle
by hiding at all
costs her affair.

808
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,296
She knew that
the Ionger Sarah
was alive,

809
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:32,459
the greater the chances
someone would find out

810
00:40:32,535 --> 00:40:35,129
that Daniel Brown
was not the father.

811
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:39,165
So she killed her daughter,

812
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:44,645
a helpless child who had
not yet begun to suffer
the effects of Tay-Sachs,

813
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:47,705
all of this to conceal
the fact that she'd slept
with another man.

814
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:52,183
The defense would
have you believe
this was an act of mercy.

815
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,920
It wasn't.

816
00:40:56,392 --> 00:40:59,088
This was a clear-cut
case of murder.

817
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:11,533
On the sole count of murder
in the second degree,
how does the jury find?

818
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:17,139
We find the defendant guilty.

819
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,345
(SOBBING)

820
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:45,369
Good work, Counselor.

821
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:47,102
She didn't
deserve 25-to-Iife.

822
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:48,268
Jury thought so.

823
00:41:48,344 --> 00:41:50,175
Because I turned
her into a whore.

824
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:52,339
It doesn't matter.
She killed her child.

825
00:41:52,414 --> 00:41:54,143
What if it was
your daughter?

826
00:41:54,216 --> 00:41:55,877
What would you
have done?

827
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:01,382
Whatever I could.
