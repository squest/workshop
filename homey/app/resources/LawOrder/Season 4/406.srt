NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:04,301
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

00:00:04,806 --> 00:00:05,898
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,977
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:12,502
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,708
These are their stories.

STARTER: What'd you do?
Take a detour
through Staten Island?

9
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:24,789
Freaking construction
on the Van Wyck.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,725
20 minutes at a dead stop.

11
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:28,727
Sorry for the delay, folks.

12
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:30,765
Customers ain't interested
in your problems.

13
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:31,992
Relax, everyone.

14
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:35,400
We'II be on our way quick
if you Ioad up your Iuggage
in an orderly fashion

15
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,631

00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:41,601
What the hell?

18
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:43,007
Call 911.

19
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:44,340
JFK Terminal 5.

20
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:45,437
We got a body on the bus.
I'm a nurse.

21
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,539
Ma'am, please stand back.

22
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,412
Barely breathing,
no pulse.

23
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,181
Can anybody help
with CPR?

24
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:57,282
Detective Katie Moore.

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,587
Hello, EIIiot.

26
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,150
My boss caught me
on my way into work,

27
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,594
told me to meet
Queens Special Victims
out here.

28
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:05,462
Now, we got a kid
in a Iuggage compartment?

29
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:06,592
Dead kid now.

30
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:10,160
Hispanic male
about nine or ten.
Asphyxiated.

31
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,364
Any ID?

32
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,702
Nothing in his pockets.

33
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:13,930
How we doing?

34
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,240
Cherry red Iips
and discoloration
under his fingernails.

35
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,109
Probably carbon
monoxide poisoning.

36
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:20,648
Where's the sex crime?

37
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,945
I found blood and
fluids in his underwear.

38
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:25,213
He also has
a two inch Iaceration
on his Ieft arm

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,811
and fresh bruising on
his chest and back.

40
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:30,414
Somebody kicked
the crap out of this kid.

41
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:34,326
And you invited me
out here to Queens because...

42
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:37,832
I've been waiting
for you to ask me
that for eight months.

43
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:41,801
Since we stuck you
with that dead hooker.
Is this payback, Katie?

44
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,601
Bus came straight from
the yard in Manhattan.
No stops, no pickups.

45
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:49,405
This poor kid was
assaulted on your turf,
so he's all yours.

46
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,457
Log says bus 202
was out of service

47
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,058
from 11 Iast night
till 7 this morning.

48
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:49,729
Any chance the kid
could have sneaked on
before it came back here?

49
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:50,896
No, we would have
found him.

50
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,837
Driver stays behind
to check every compartment,

51
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:54,705
all the seats, you know,
see if anything was Ieft.

52
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,767
They got security
at the front gate.
Any other way in here?

53
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,507
That's what I
wanted to show you.

54
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,014
You got yourself
a rat problem.

55
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,348
Tell me about it.
Every time we fix one
of these, another one pops up.

56
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,048
We're constantly kicking out
street kids and hookers.

57
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:10,250
Looks Iike you
caught a piece of one
right here.

58
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:12,555
The bus the kid was on,
where was it parked
Iast night?

59
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,958
Over here.

60
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:18,330
The bus Ieft for JFK
at seven this morning.

61
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,996
Liv, you got
a glove on you?

62
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:26,006
Here you go,
what did you find?

63
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,474
There's something
underneath the wheel.

64
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:32,711
Teddy bear.

65
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,678
It's not weathered.

66
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,009
That Iooks Iike
dried blood to me.

67
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:39,519
Maybe the cut
from the kids arm.

68
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:40,987
And there's
glass imbedded in it.

69
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,024
Hey, you have
any broken windows
on the Iot this morning?

70
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,321
Yeah, well, we
haven't had much of
a problem with vandalism

71
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:48,260
ever since the insurance
company made us put in
security cameras.

72
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,423
Okay, we'II need
to take a Iook
at Iast night's tapes.

73
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:51,554
Sure.

74
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,035
MUNCH: 11:47. There.

75
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:56,661
Walking along the fence.

76
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,798
The victim's holding hands
with this older kid.

77
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,368
CRAGEN: What's he
holding right there?

78
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:08,075
STABLER: Teddy bear.
We found one of those
at the bus depot.

79
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,548
FIN: There goes his shirt.

80
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:14,351
CRAGEN: You know, the victim
doesn't Iook Iike he's
being forced. Run it back.

81
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:15,753
Who is this
older kid, anyway?

82
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,121
Could be his brother.

83
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:20,184
Or the perp tricks the victim
into following him,
rapes him in the yard,

84
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:21,820
then Iocks him in
the Iuggage compartment.

85
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,364
Yeah, but the DOA
was clean. If he'd been
sodomized in that yard,

86
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,458
you'd expect to find
abrasions on his hands,
his knees, I mean, somewhere.

87
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:28,900
Could have happened
on another bus.

88
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,131
In which case
our already
contaminated crime scene

89
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:32,639
may be on its way to
one of the airports.

90
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,368
AIong with our perp.

91
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,569
I'II call the bus company
and the Port Authority cops,

92
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:37,907
have them put out alerts.

93
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,344
What about missing persons?

94
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:40,779
OIivia's there right now.

95
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:42,507
Have her meet you
at the morgue.

96
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:45,178
If our M.E. can find something
to help us ID the victim,

97
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,380
maybe we can
catch a break.

98
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:51,658
The blood on
the teddy bear is type AB,
same as the victim.

99
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,750
What about the glass?

100
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:55,295
Consistent with
what I found in the cut
on his arm.

101
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:58,730
Crime Iab says it's
tempered safety glass,
no coating or tinting.

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,461
So it's probably not
from a car window?

103
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,332
More Iike the kind
used for sound proofing.

104
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,235
Now, a teddy bear seems Iike
an awful strange thing

105
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,773
for a street kid to
be carrying around.

106
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,865
Your victim's no street kid.

107
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:11,207
He's recently bathed,
well-nourished
and disease-free.

108
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,747
And, somebody spent
a Iot of money
on his mouth.

109
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:14,804
Noah?

110
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:16,441
Detectives
Stabler and Benson,

111
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:19,919
this is our
forensic odontologist,
Doctor Noah Kamens.

112
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,888
So, how much we talking
for this dental work?

113
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:25,722
Smooth, invisible braces.
An implant where no
permanent tooth grew in,

114
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:28,126
I'd say we're Iooking
at ten grand, total.

115
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:30,096
Any idea how Iong
ago this was done?

116
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:32,963
Judging from the condition
of the materials,
within the Iast month.

117
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,594
There's got to be a couple
hundred orthodontists in
the Tri-State area.

118
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,137
True, but
the implant's
custom-made,

119
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:39,139
so the manufacturer's ID
will be on it.

120
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:42,267
We'II pull the fake tooth,
the Iab who made it can tell
us which dentist ordered it.

121
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:43,436
Detectives.

122
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:45,370
Benson.

123
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,938
Rape kit's back.
Positive for semen.

124
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,175
And I just
found something else
when I rolled him.

125
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:53,311
Suture scars.
Recently healed,
on his anus.

126
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:56,050
Someone's been
violently abusing this kid
for some time.

127
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,853
Thanks.

128
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,918
We got to go.
They may have
just found our perp.

129
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,626
BUS DRIVER: Pulled in
45 minutes ago.

130
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:07,794
One of the passengers
was this kid but I don't
remember him getting on.

131
00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:08,994
Do you recognize this?

132
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,765
Yeah.
That Iooks Iike the shirt
he was wearing.

133
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,897
How many stops
did you make?

134
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,099
Only one,
Grand Central.

135
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:15,734
Anyway, I ask
to see his ticket stub,
and he bolts.

136
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,334
He must've been
hiding on the bus.

137
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,903
Did you see where he went?
Yeah, I chased him
down this way.

138
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:22,074
He ran right in there,
but I Iost him in the crowd.

139
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,947
Port Authority cops said
you waited 15 minutes

140
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,349
before you
called them, how come?

141
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,615
Are you kidding?
My dispatcher
would skin me alive

142
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,089
if he found out
I Ieft that bus
unattended two seconds.

143
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,625
Look, I'm running Iate.
I got to get out of here.

144
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:32,990
You stay here.
We're not done.

145
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,289
Driver made
a positive ID.

146
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,522
Thanks.

147
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:36,689
Any sign of the kid?

148
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,995
15 minutes ago, right here.
One of my guys spotted him.

149
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,056
Kid took off.

150
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:41,159
AII right.

151
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:44,105
I called in for help
as soon as I got
the heads-up

152
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:45,935
that you had
a piece of his clothes.

153
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:48,703
Maybe we can sniff him out.

154
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:50,404
BENSON: Here's the shirt.

155
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,052
(BARKING)

156
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,283
STABLER: What's back there?

157
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:04,619
It Ieads
straight to the tarmac.

158
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,353
We can get out
there this way.

159
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:22,376
STABLER: Stop!

160
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:23,604
Police. Stop!

161
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,749
Are you trying to
get yourself killed?

162
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:30,910
Leave me alone!
Calm down.

163
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,643
I want to go home.
Calm down.

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,744
We're trying
to help you.

165
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:34,982
Now, calm...
I want to go home.

166
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,318
I want to go home.

167
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,755
We're trying
to help you.

168
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:39,487
I want to go home.

169
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,392
STABLER: What's your name?

170
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,438
Hey, you're in
a Iot of trouble.
Do you understand that?

171
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:52,703
Deport me.

172
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:54,172
We don't deport killers.

173
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:55,231
I didn't kill anyone.

174
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,677
Then what happened
to your Iittle friend
with the teddy bear?

175
00:07:58,746 --> 00:07:59,872
Jos�?

176
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,714
He's dead?

177
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,217
Okay,
Iet's try this again.
From the start.

178
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:09,822
What's your name?

179
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,085
Ernesto.

180
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,057
Ernesto Diaz.

181
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,062
Is Jos� your brother?

182
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,654
He's my friend.

183
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:22,124
You said at the airport
that you wanted to go home.

184
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:23,693
Where's home?

185
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,337
Guatemala.

186
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,366
Jos�, too.

187
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:29,967
Well, how did you
get here?

188
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:34,676
By boat.

189
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:37,774
Two years ago.

190
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:43,518
My parents sent me
here to go to school.

191
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,821
The charity promised
to protect me.

192
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:52,524
But instead they
gave me and Jos�
to the man.

193
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:55,562
What charity?

194
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:57,070
ERNESTO: I don't know.

195
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,833
Did you come here with Jos�?

196
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:00,101
ERNESTO: No.

197
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,111
He came in Iast month.

198
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:14,078
The man said I was getting
too old to please him.

199
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,428
What did he do to you?

200
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,794
Kept us Iocked up.

201
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,800
Made us have sex with him.

202
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,747
He would beat us
when we said no.

203
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:46,586
Did you ever try
to escape before?

204
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,814
ERNESTO: Once.

205
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,619
He said he would kill Jos�
and my parents if
I ever did it again.

206
00:09:52,694 --> 00:09:55,060
But I couldn't watch
Jos� suffer no more.

207
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:56,619
Ernesto...

208
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:59,098
He's not going to hurt you.
He's not going to
hurt your parents

209
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:02,534
or anyone else ever again,
but we need your help.

210
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,172
Bret Jansen.

211
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:11,812
He made us call him "Dad".

212
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,308
The National
Center for Missing
and Exploited Children

213
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,581
and NCIC have
nothing on Jos�
or Ernesto,

214
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:22,418
and INS has no
record of a visa.

215
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,788
Maybe the Guatemalan police
know if they were kidnapped.

216
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:25,848
What about Jansen?

217
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:28,418
There's a Bret Jansen
Iisted on Thomas Street.

218
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:31,090
That matches
Ernesto's description,
not far from Ground Zero.

219
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:32,723
Well, if that's him,
"Dad" has some bucks.

220
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,529
He's a partner at Stitt,
Beam and Cornell,

221
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:36,399
blue chip Wall
Street Iaw firm.

222
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,004
With his own
personal sex slaves.

223
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,233
You know,
if the INS never
processed these kids,

224
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,639
he had to have
smuggled them in here.

225
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,734
Well, Iet's go pick
him up at his office
and ask him about it.

226
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,006
Jansen's office
says he's MIA.

227
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,048
He's probably out somewhere
Iooking for his boys.

228
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:52,644
So we'II get a warrant for
his place. Ernesto's statement
has got to be enough.

229
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,859
AII these deadbolts
are unlocked.

230
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,456
This door weighs a ton.

231
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:03,825
Steel over wood,

232
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,889
foam and rubber
on the inside.
It's sound-proofed.

233
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,264
FIoors are, too.
They're elevated,

234
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,563
probably
insulation underneath.

235
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:12,367
Magnetic Iocks.
This guy's serious
about his security.

236
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,442
Windows are Iocked,
it Iooks Iike you need
a key to open all of them.

237
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,103
Guys, over here.

238
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:20,904
Broken window.

239
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,282
Went down the fire escape.

240
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,080
Dad didn't even bother
to clean up the glass.

241
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:26,848
Jansen must've panicked
when he came home,

242
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,014
found the boys missing,
rushed right
out to find them.

243
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,786
Poultry shears.
Probably used it
to cut through the wire mesh.

244
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,625
Explains the cut on Jos�'s arm
and the broken glass
on the teddy bear.

245
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:38,860
And why it's tempered. Even if
the boys screamed for help
nobody would hear them.

246
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,424
So far Ernesto's
story totally checks out.

247
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,903
This Iock has been jimmied.
Got the shears out
of this drawer, huh?

248
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,305
Both the boys' bedrooms
also have magnetic Iocks
on the doors.

249
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,276
Kept them Iocked in
to protect his investment.

250
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:52,039
And I haven't seen
a phone around here anywhere.

251
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,738
Probably got
them Iocked up, too.

252
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,646
I think we found the guy
who owns this place.

253
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:57,275
Where?
In bed.

254
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:03,547
SIeep tight, Mr. Jansen.

255
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,386
Somebody slit his throat.

256
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:13,265
And sliced off
the family jewels.

257
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,773
Doctor found bruises
all over his body.

258
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,810
Permanent damage
from being repeatedly
sodomized over two years.

259
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:25,539
That's a hell
of a good reason
to cut up Jansen.

260
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:28,377
Ernesto have anything to do
with this murder?

261
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:29,814
It's possible.

262
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:32,944
Jansen used his
genitals as a weapon
against him and Jos�.

263
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,920
Cutting them off
might be
the ultimate protection.

264
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,684
That crime scene
was a bloodbath

265
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,419
and Ernesto didn't
have a drop on him.

266
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:40,222
PIus we didn't find
any spattered clothing.

267
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,524
And CSU found
fresh traces of blood
in the shower.

268
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:46,863
So whoever did kill Jansen
was savvy enough to
clean up after himself.

269
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:49,562
An adult might think of that,
but a 14-year-old boy?

270
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,662
I said it was possible.
I didn't say I
thought he did it.

271
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:55,869
Just seeing Jansen chopped up
would be horrific enough
to traumatize this kid.

272
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,638
If he saw the murder,
then he might be afraid

273
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:59,942
that the killer will harm him
if he tells.

274
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:01,504
Well,
what's the strategy, Doc?

275
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,777
Ernesto was abused by a man.

276
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:07,378
OIivia, give him
all the affection
and approval you can.

277
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,720
Ernesto.

278
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:20,132
Last night,

279
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:23,136
no matter what happened,

280
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:24,330
it's not your fault.

281
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:25,497
Do you understand that?

282
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:28,064
Jos�'s dead.
That's my fault.

283
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,634
No, sweetheart.
You tried
to save Jos�.

284
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:34,943
Not many boys your age
would have done that.

285
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:39,248
Now, I can help you
but I need to know
what happened Iast night.

286
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,755
PIease, Ernesto,
Iet me help you.

287
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:50,455
He went into Jos�'s room.

288
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:54,058
I heard him crying,
begging him to stop.

289
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,772
I yelled,

290
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:06,541
called him a pig.
I told him to
Ieave Jos� alone.

291
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:14,711
Then he came in,
pulled me out of bed,

292
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:19,289
and I hit him
over and over.

293
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,351
And what did he do?

294
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,953
He just smiled.

295
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,036
He said when he
was done with Jos�

296
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:31,469
I'd find out
what real pain was.

297
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,340
Then what?

298
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,439
He was mad.

299
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:42,380
He told Jos�,
if he didn't be quiet,

300
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,782
he'd send him
to the other men.

301
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,454
But Jos� cried,

302
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,514
begged him to stop.

303
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,827
He got so mad he Ieft.

304
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:57,660
Ernesto, these other men...

305
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,463
Did he ever send you to them?

306
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,671
I'm afraid.
Honey, I promise you,

307
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:09,470
nobody can hurt you
as Iong as you're with us.

308
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,067
I promise you.

309
00:15:14,382 --> 00:15:16,475
They'd take me for a while.

310
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,315
Then they would give me back.

311
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:25,952
I didn't want them
to do that to Jos�.

312
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:30,563
Now it's a ring
of pedophiles.

313
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,326
How many of
these sick bastards
raped that kid?

314
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,494
Better find them fast.
God knows how many other
boys they're passing around.

315
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,595
The Ievel of rage
in Jansen's murder
could've been jealousy.

316
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:41,369
Especially if one of
his boy-sharing buddies
kept Ernesto

317
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,431
and didn't want
to give him back.

318
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,104
That makes sense.
Jansen had to know
whoever killed him.

319
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,079
That apartment
was Iocked up
Iike a fortress.

320
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:51,141
Captain, it gets worse.
You better see what
we found in his crib.

321
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:57,283
MUNCH: For your
viewing disgust.

322
00:15:57,358 --> 00:15:59,623
Apparently Jansen wasn't
satisfied just victimizing
Jos� and Ernesto.

323
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:01,219
Oh, that's great.
Two men and a kid

324
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:03,059
no older than
my 10-year-old son.

325
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,793
CRAGEN: Well,
I recognize Jansen,
but who's the other guy?

326
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:10,338
MUNCH: I forced myself to
scroll through this excrement.
You never see his face.

327
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:13,897
STABLER: Second guy's got
a couple tattoos.

328
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:16,740
Let's turn this off.
Turn it off, will you?

329
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,042
Odds are that video was made
in Central America,

330
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:21,844
since that's where Jansen
found Jos� and Ernesto.

331
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:26,251
We also got adoption papers
on both the boys, all bogus.

332
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,619
But this will really
make your skin crawl.

333
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,319
Bulletins from the
North American
Man/Boy Love Association

334
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:34,328
and their constitution.

335
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:36,387
We got ourselves
a NAMBLA member.

336
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:40,026
This stuff is
Iike a how-to guide
for pedophiles.

337
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:42,195
"Keep your Iover's
identity a secret,

338
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,262
"never discuss
your relationship
with a shrink.

339
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,433
"Hide your photos
where the cops
can't find them."

340
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:51,001
"How to make that
special boy feel good."
Complete with instructions.

341
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,910
They're pedophiles
who claim they can help boys

342
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:55,074
as young as three
discover their sexuality

343
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:57,310
in a non-threatening,
nurturing way.

344
00:16:57,386 --> 00:17:00,082
And they hide behind
the First Amendment
to spew that crap.

345
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:03,283
But they operate in cells
Iike al-Qaeda, so one group
can't finger another.

346
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,792
Look, Iet's be honest.
Killing Jansen was
a public service.

347
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:06,953
And if we find
who did kill him,

348
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:11,090
it might Iead us to
the rest of these pervs
and the boys they're keeping.

349
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,135
Now, first thing
in the morning, you and OIivia
go to Jansen's Iaw office,

350
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:15,328
and track down his friends.

351
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:16,837
Thanks.
That was the M.E.

352
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:19,874
I got the dentist
that worked on Jos�'s teeth.

353
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:25,804
As soon as
the Iab notified us,
my assistant called you guys.

354
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:26,870
How did Jos� die?

355
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,415
We think it was an accident.

356
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:30,143
His father must
be devastated.

357
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,310
Well, he's dead, too,

358
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,286
and that wasn't an accident.

359
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,356
My God, what happened?

360
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:36,618
Murdered in his apartment.

361
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:37,952
And Ernesto?

362
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,586
He's fine.
You took care of him?

363
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:42,596
The occasional
cleaning and filling.

364
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:44,655
Nothing Iike
the work I did on Jos�.

365
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,394
MUNCH: How well did you
know Bret Jansen?

366
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:48,493
Not well at all
but I admired him

367
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:51,263
for adopting two boys
from a foreign country.

368
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:53,034
He seemed Iike
a really caring father.

369
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,803
Jansen ever
make any referrals?

370
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:58,107
No, no, we're so busy
we're not accepting
any new patients.

371
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,169
Why do you ask?

372
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:00,475
Just routine questions.

373
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,848
Anything unusual about him
or the boys you remember?

374
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,018
Well,
just that he was impatient.

375
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,919
He wanted it all
done at once and fast.

376
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,013
Did he say why?

377
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,183
He'd just adopted Jos�

378
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,724
and he was about to
enroll him in school.

379
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:16,525
Mr. Jansen told me he got
teased for having metal braces
when he was a kid

380
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:19,066
and didn't want his
son to get picked on.

381
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:21,227
Only the best for his boys.

382
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:25,134
He was a great boss.

383
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,675
I'm sick over this.
We all are.

384
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:29,801
Did you keep his calendar?

385
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:32,278
I put his daily schedule
on the computer.

386
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:34,713
But Mr. Jansen kept
his own Iawyer's diary.

387
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,081
It's that red book
on his desk.

388
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,187
Surprised there are
no family pictures around.

389
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,382
Mr. Jansen didn't
have any family.

390
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:45,085
Both parents passed away,
no siblings.

391
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,128
He ever mention his two sons?

392
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:49,561
You must have him confused
with someone else.

393
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:53,067
No way Mr. Jansen has kids
and I don't know about it.

394
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:54,363
What about friends?

395
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:56,904
You know how
many hours you have
to bill to make partner?

396
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:58,633
Mr. Jansen didn't
have time for friends.

397
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:01,699
But there was
a Iunch Iast Tuesday.
Stewart Lynch?

398
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:04,836
He's a client. They ate
at Mr. Jansen's club.

399
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:10,113
LYNCH: Bret was
a real Iadies' man.

400
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,415
Different beautiful girl
every week.

401
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:13,847
I was jealous.

402
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:15,446
He ever mention
having children?

403
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:18,220
No, the only kids
we ever talked
about were mine.

404
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:20,853
I could brag
about them all day.

405
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:22,556
I don't think
Bret would have made
a very good father.

406
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:24,326
And why's that?

407
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,128
He had a terrible temper.

408
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:30,204
Let Iittle things tick
him off that wouldn't
bother most guys.

409
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:31,967
Kids would have
driven him crazy.

410
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,235
Was he friends
with anyone else
here in the club?

411
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,039
Uh, Tony Damon's
the only person
I can think of.

412
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,011
They played squash together.

413
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,546
Okay.

414
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,817
Thanks for your time.

415
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:47,855
Oh, one more thing.
You ever been to
Jansen's apartment?

416
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:48,947
No.

417
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:51,487
Thanks, Mr. Lynch.
We'II be in touch.

418
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,858
No problem,
and it's Dr. Lynch.

419
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:56,587
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
What kind of doctor are you?

420
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,067
Reconstructive
plastic surgery.
My specialty is hand repair.

421
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:02,229
Well, Dr. Lynch,
would you mind telling us
where you were

422
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:03,932
the night that
Jansen was murdered?

423
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:07,942
Not at all. I was in the OR
from 10:00 at night
until dawn the next morning

424
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,912
re-attaching
a thumb and two fingers
severed in a car accident.

425
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:14,375
STABLER: Two nights ago?

426
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,577
I was home, just off
the plane from Chicago.

427
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,711
Still have the boarding pass
if you need it.

428
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:20,187
That won't be necessary,
Mr. Damon.

429
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:23,783
We just heard that you
and Mr. Jansen played squash
a couple of times a week.

430
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,417
Well, when I'm in town.

431
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:27,394
Bret usually kicked my ass
all over the court.

432
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:29,454
Did you ever socialize
outside the club?

433
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,624
I'm on the road a Iot
for work, Detective.

434
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,601
I spend my down
time at home relaxing.

435
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,127
Come on, you must know
something about him?

436
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:38,639
He had a strange
sense of humor.

437
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:40,207
How so?

438
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:44,278
Friday, we're in a match,
I serve and ace him.

439
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:47,373
He Iaughs, says
it was a Iucky shot,

440
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,543
because I usually
play Iike a woman,

441
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:53,521
and that he should have
cut off my balls years ago.

442
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:58,492
Jansen's genitals
weren't exactly cut off,
they were surgically excised.

443
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:01,861
Come again?

444
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:06,867
Removed with a scalpel
by someone who knows
anatomy. And pre-mortem.

445
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:10,394
So someone wanted
to really make him suffer.

446
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:12,338
How did the perp
incapacitate him?

447
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:14,535
Whacked him on the head
with a blunt object.

448
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,237
Probably took that with him.

449
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,440
Now, an amateur would have
slit his throat right across.

450
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:22,973
Jansen's killer
made precise incisions
at the carotid artery.

451
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,986
Here and here, after...

452
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:27,386
You don't need to
demonstrate that part.

453
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,256
PIastic surgeon
would know how to do
the job on Jansen.

454
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:31,452
And sew up Jos�.

455
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:32,754
Like an expert.

456
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:39,057
Ernesto, we got
some good news for you.

457
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:42,036
Did you find my
mama and papa?
BENSON: Yep.

458
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:43,571
And they're coming here
to get you.

459
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:45,231
When?
Tomorrow.

460
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:49,039
But, Iisten, first
we need your help
one more time.

461
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:50,738
What is it?

462
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:54,044
Well, you said Bret
sent you to
some other men.

463
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:55,981
Do you know any names?

464
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:59,086
No.
What about a doctor?

465
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:01,783
Did he ever take you
or Jos� to go see a doctor?

466
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:03,916
He would come over
to see us,
when we were sick.

467
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:05,688
Okay, do you know
his name?

468
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:07,523
No. But he was nice.

469
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:09,621
Ernesto, did he
ever touch you?

470
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,132
Never.

471
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,963
We're going to
show you some photos.

472
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:15,332
Do you recognize anybody?
Just tell us.

473
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,769
That's him.
That's our doctor.

474
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:25,005
You're sure?

475
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:26,810
Yes.

476
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:28,712
The good Dr. Lynch.

477
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:36,146
Lynch has three sons,
all adopted.
He's never been married.

478
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,659
He's head of
reconstructive surgery
at Chelsea Hospital.

479
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:42,687
He's known for
operating on disfigured kids
in third world countries.

480
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:45,256
And, in his spare time,
he sews up his
friends' slave boys.

481
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,596
Guy's a real humanitarian.

482
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:47,998
What about Damon?

483
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,903
Damon owns a travel agency
called GIobal Voyages.

484
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:53,373
He Iives in Scarsdale.
He's single, no children.

485
00:22:53,442 --> 00:22:55,569
Now, there was a whole Iot
of phone activity between them

486
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:57,111
the night that
Jansen was murdered.

487
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:03,084
At 10:52 Jansen makes
a 30-second call to Lynch.

488
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:06,178
Presumably when he came home
to find the boys
had flown the coop.

489
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:11,454
Then Jansen called Damon,
they talked for two minutes.

490
00:23:11,594 --> 00:23:15,052
Damon then gave Lynch
a 20-second call back.

491
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:18,794
Customs says
that Jansen traveled
to Guatemala two years ago,

492
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:20,859
around the time
Ernesto was brought here.

493
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:22,927
That's probably
when that videotape
was made.

494
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:24,939
Damon is
setting up his friends
on sex tours,

495
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:26,599
and they're bringing
back human souvenirs.

496
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,302
And passing them
around to their friends.

497
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:32,905
Which means we've got to
try to get Lynch's kids
out of that house tonight.

498
00:23:34,383 --> 00:23:37,045
AII we have are
two phone calls?
That's not enough.

499
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,553
STABLER: We checked,
Lynch's three kids are boys.

500
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:41,886
God knows what he's doing
to them right now.

501
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:43,356
Are they Iegally adopted?

502
00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:45,917
We won't know
that information
until tomorrow morning.

503
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,724
Does he keep them Iocked up
Iike Jansen's does?

504
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:50,197
No, all three of the boys
go to public schools.

505
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:51,961
Are there any
complaints of abuse?

506
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,830
None to ACS or
the Iocal precinct.

507
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:56,599
Look, we already have Lynch
on failing to report
Jos�'s abuse.

508
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,138
LANGAN: An A misdemeanor?

509
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:01,904
With no priors I'd argue
for a fine and no jail time.

510
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:04,207
I think AIex is
dining with the enemy.

511
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:06,610
Can you give us two minutes?

512
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:10,379
Yeah, the game's on
at the bar. Why don't I
check that out?

513
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:15,881
Look, we take
Lynch's kids away from him,
and we are wrong.

514
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,724
A heavy hitter Iike him
is gonna drag us into court
and make our Iives miserable.

515
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:20,819
Get me some hard evidence.

516
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:24,491
Computer crimes
found this buried
on Jansen's hard drive.

517
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,660
Your special tour
to Central America
is confirmed.

518
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:28,498
If your friends enjoy,
have them get in touch.

519
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:30,562
That is an e-mail
from Damon to Jansen

520
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:32,697
right before Jansen's trip
two years ago.

521
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,402
Now, that sounds Iike
a confirmation Ietter.

522
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:38,436
And that he's soliciting men
to travel overseas
to rape children.

523
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:40,414
That's a federal crime.

524
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:45,111
Let's catch him in the act.

525
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:51,925
Anthony Damon.
Mr. BIackmum, is it?

526
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:55,289
John BIackmum.
So, you got my e-mail?

527
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:57,389
About our special tour
to the Philippines.

528
00:24:57,533 --> 00:25:00,627
Let me first ask you
where you got my
e-mail address.

529
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:03,501
From a friend of ours.
But I don't want to
mention any names.

530
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:06,336
Well, your personal and credit
information checked out okay.

531
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:07,602
You ran my credit?

532
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:11,043
To make sure you are
who you say you are,
for both of our protection.

533
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:13,104
Which is why I also
need to see some ID.

534
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,240
I understand completely.

535
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:21,081
Good.

536
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:22,817
It's a standard
two-week package.

537
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:26,055
You fly business class,
stay in a business hotel,

538
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:30,087
meals and entertainment
included for $5000.

539
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:32,531
And the entertainment?

540
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,968
Do you prefer girls or boys?
Or both?

541
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:40,667
Boys. 11 to 13.

542
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:43,644
We work with an orphanage,
five-year-olds on up.

543
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:47,671
PIus, you get a videotape
so you can
cherish the memory.

544
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,481
Great. It's all there.
I didn't want to
Ieave a paper trail.

545
00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:56,717
When would you
Iike to travel,
Mr. BIackmum?

546
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:58,420
Or is there another
name you'd Iike to use?

547
00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:00,223
As a matter of fact,
there is.

548
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:03,357
John Munch, but you
can call me Detective.

549
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:05,333
Get up. Put your hands
behind your back right now.

550
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:06,835
Now! Now!

551
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,403
This is entrapment.

552
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:09,870
And we call it conspiracy.

553
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,100
Police officers.
Step away from the table.

554
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:12,435
Don't touch anything.

555
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:16,001
Get the computers
and the files.

556
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,478
Tape good?
Did you get it all?

557
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:19,572
Every single word.
Great.

558
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,487
So, what's this conspiracy
that you're charging me with?

559
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:28,854
Facilitating
the rape of children
in foreign countries.

560
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,187
There's no state
Iaw against that.

561
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,522
STABLER: Federal Iaw.

562
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,891
We turn our tape
over to the US Attorney,
you're toast.

563
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:36,660
Federal statutes require
proof of a sex act.

564
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,291
That means they
need a victim.

565
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:39,993
Where are they
gonna find one?

566
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,095
No wonder this guy
doesn't need a Iawyer.

567
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:44,333
He's got the Iaw memorized
with all his other
NAMBLA buddies.

568
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:46,500
NAMBLA?
I'm not one of those freaks.

569
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:48,770
How many boys they
pass around to you?

570
00:26:48,845 --> 00:26:51,609
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

571
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:53,842
Do you think I am
some dumb cop?

572
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:55,282
I had nothing...

573
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,819
EIIiot.
You think you're
smarter than me?

574
00:26:56,886 --> 00:26:58,854
I need a doctor.
You're gonna need
a morgue, pal.

575
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:00,412
He's not worth it.
Get off me!

576
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,449
You're nothing
but a Iow-Iife pimp
who sells children.

577
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:06,722
You sent Bret Jansen
on a sex tour.

578
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:09,822
Him and a friend made a video
doing a 10-year-old boy.

579
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:10,888
Friend?
Yeah.

580
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:11,991
I don't know
about any friend.

581
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,126
Yeah, right just
Iike you didn't know

582
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:15,763
your customers have
been smuggling back
Iittle sex toys of their own.

583
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,206
Listen, Jansen and Lynch
did that on their own.
I had nothing to do with it.

584
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:20,674
You got nothing to do
with anything, do you?

585
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:23,110
How about sex tours?
Do you know anything
about them?

586
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:25,238
Do you book sex tours?
Yes. Yes.

587
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:26,680
How many do you book?

588
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:28,181
Couple dozen.

589
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:29,275
Yeah?
Over the years.

590
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:30,649
Yeah. Just a couple dozen?

591
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,119
I swear, I'm not one of them.

592
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:33,346
I was just in it
for the money.

593
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:34,515
Which the Feds
are gonna take away

594
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:37,219
from you, while you're
sitting on death row for
slicing up Bret Jansen.

595
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:39,352
What? I had nothing
to do with that.

596
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:44,731
That's funny, because somebody
did to him exactly what
he joked about doing to you.

597
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,530
That rat bastard.
You got to be more specific,

598
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,093
there's a Iot of them
running around in this case.

599
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:52,608
Lynch. I told him about
Jansen's joke that he was
gonna cut my balls off.

600
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:53,870
He's using it to set me up.

601
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:55,308
Why would he want
to kill Jansen?

602
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:57,972
Because Lynch
hand-picked Jos�
for Jansen.

603
00:27:58,048 --> 00:27:59,948
Then Jansen called Lynch,
said he wanted his money back

604
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:01,415
when Jos� and
Ernesto escaped.

605
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:03,145
When's the Iast time
you spoke to Lynch?

606
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:04,880
Before Jansen was killed.

607
00:28:05,021 --> 00:28:06,955
Lynch called, he said
he wanted to know

608
00:28:07,023 --> 00:28:08,456
why the video of this trip
hadn't arrived yet.

609
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:12,256
I told him it was on its way.

610
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:15,161
Make me a deal.
Make me a deal,

611
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:17,529
and I will give you
Lynch on a silver platter.

612
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:22,802
What can we do here?

613
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:25,670
The sex tours are federal
and I am not giving him
immunity

614
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:27,972
until we're sure
he didn't kill Jansen.

615
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:30,012
Maybe we can get Lynch
without Damon's help.

616
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,572
The doctor's sex tour
video is in the mail.

617
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,585
Have the post office
set up a sneak preview.

618
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:42,617
Postal Inspectors found it
in a box marked Iike pottery

619
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:43,989
and knew it was
the real deal.

620
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,028
Mail carrier drops
it off 15 minutes ago.

621
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:48,530
He Ieaves, Lynch comes out,
scoops it right up.

622
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:51,863
Like a kid attacking the tree
on Christmas morning.

623
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:58,404
Police, open the door.

624
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:02,668
(BENSON SPEAKING SPANISH)

625
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:07,909
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

626
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:13,883
He's in the study.

627
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,162
What's up, Doc?

628
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:28,463
You can't just barge in here
Iike this.

629
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:33,635
We just wanted to
watch a Iittle TV.
What's on?

630
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,270
Looks Iike the doc's star
of his own freak show.

631
00:29:36,346 --> 00:29:37,677
Put your hands
behind your back.

632
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:39,145
Where'd you get
Ramon and his brothers?

633
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:41,649
They're my
Iegally adopted sons.
I have the papers to prove it.

634
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:45,552
Oh, and the boy on the tape,
he Iegally adopted?

635
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:48,853
I'm not saying anything
without an attorney.

636
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:51,758
Yeah, well, I'm sure
this will say it all.

637
00:29:58,568 --> 00:30:00,502
If you're offering a deal,
we're willing to Iisten.

638
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,935
Listen to this.

639
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:06,237
We checked the adoption papers
on your so-called sons,
they're all forgeries.

640
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,335
We also found the INS agent
you paid to
phony up their visas

641
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:11,277
and Bret Jansen's
two boys' visas,

642
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:13,372
as well as...
Well, who knows
how many others.

643
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:16,941
That is 10 years'
federal prison for
every boy you smuggled in.

644
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,319
I smuggled in?
Are you people insane?

645
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,381
Not to mention kidnapping
and sexual abuse.

646
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,551
I didn't abuse my sons.

647
00:30:24,627 --> 00:30:27,460
Stewart...
Look. No, I need to say this.

648
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,591
I would never force my boys
to do anything
they didn't want to do.

649
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:37,568
Your boys are
barely teenagers.

650
00:30:37,707 --> 00:30:40,437
They can't consent
to statutory rape.

651
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,104
How'd they feel about you
passing them around
to your pedophile pals?

652
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:45,340
I did no such thing.
I Iove them.

653
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:47,642
I would never do
anything to hurt them.

654
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:53,813
You're not actually
considering bringing this
NAMBLA crap to court?

655
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,357
The boys will tell
you it's all true.

656
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:58,451
And when our shrink testifies
to how your client
brainwashed them,

657
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:02,464
the jury is going to
Iock him up
and throw away the key.

658
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:06,491
Sex abuse three for his sons
and immunity on
any federal charges.

659
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,127
I can't speak for
the US Attorney.

660
00:31:08,204 --> 00:31:11,833
You're going to
have to give me
something I can bring her.

661
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:21,041
Damon is the one
smuggling in boys.

662
00:31:21,184 --> 00:31:23,778
Is he a NAMBLA member, too?

663
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:28,290
No, they're just
merchandise to him.

664
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:32,692
He brought in six boys a year,
two at a time on
a chartered sailboat.

665
00:31:32,762 --> 00:31:34,821
Who else is in the ring?

666
00:31:34,964 --> 00:31:37,023
I'II give you the names
of everyone I know.

667
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:42,996
The night Jansen was murdered,
what did he say to
you on the phone?

668
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:44,562
What are you talking about?
I never spoke to him.

669
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:48,008
STABLER: Until you
sliced him up?
Not another word, Stewart.

670
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:51,710
I didn't kill anybody.

671
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:54,249
You surgically
removed his genitals
and cut his throat.

672
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:57,218
We have a statement from
our M.E., saying the killer
had medical knowledge.

673
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:59,517
I was in surgery
the night Bret was killed.

674
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:01,716
You're a Iiar. Your hospital
said you were on vacation.

675
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:05,056
Wrong hospital.
The case I did
was up in Rochester.

676
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,999
I am telling you,
I would never do
two men and a boy.

677
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,197
Prove it.
Take your shirt off.

678
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:18,638
I'm not doing
anything without an attorney.

679
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:21,734
Okay, here's how we're gonna
find out which one of you
is the movie star.

680
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:24,336
We're gonna get
a court order,
we're gonna strip you,

681
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:27,178
we're gonna take
some pretty pictures
and see if your tats match.

682
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,684
We rounded up
17 pervs so far.

683
00:32:29,752 --> 00:32:32,380
Teacher, court clerk,
engineer,

684
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:34,616
couple of Wall Street
masters of the universe.

685
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:38,286
AII of them say that Damon
got them their
so-called son or daughter.

686
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:39,760
How many kids?
Fourteen.

687
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:42,525
ACS is placing them
with their
temporary foster homes.

688
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:45,624
Chief of detectives wants us
to beat the feds
to a news conference,

689
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:47,795
pat us on the back
for breaking
this pedophile ring.

690
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,430
You know what
the thing of it is?
Not one of these sickos

691
00:32:50,506 --> 00:32:52,838
is gonna do nearly
as much time as
whoever killed Jansen.

692
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:55,104
And Lynch's
alibi checked out.

693
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:57,339
We got a whole operating room
full of people that swear

694
00:32:57,413 --> 00:33:00,314
that he was 350 miles
from here the night
Jansen was murdered.

695
00:33:00,383 --> 00:33:02,749
Here's the doctor's
report on Lynch's kids.

696
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:05,151
Confirms they
were sexually abused.

697
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:10,358
And that they're in otherwise
excellent health.

698
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:12,621
BIood work is normal.

699
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:16,961
Hearing and vision
all check out
and perfect teeth.

700
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:24,402
What's the name of
that dentist? Massey.

701
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:27,875
He wasn't a member of the
Metropolis CIub and he wasn't
on Damon's sex tour Iist.

702
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:29,844
It doesn't mean
he's not one of them.

703
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:32,642
These pedophiles operate
in their own
parallel netherworld.

704
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:33,875
Makes sense they'd
have a dentist, too.

705
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,178
Massey have any kids?

706
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:36,375
Two and a wife.

707
00:33:36,452 --> 00:33:40,855
And he would have taken
anatomy and done oral
surgery in dental school.

708
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:43,448
Find out how
many of their boys
Dr. Massey worked on.

709
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:47,087
If there's a pattern,
it should be enough for us
to get a warrant.

710
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:53,002
Search our house?
What in God's name for?

711
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:55,731
Mrs. Massey, I'm so sorry,
we're just doing our job.

712
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:58,103
Why don't you start upstairs
in the master bedroom,

713
00:33:58,174 --> 00:33:59,937
check everything
in the closets.

714
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:03,274
Homicide?
You think Walt
murdered someone?

715
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,143
You know where he
was two nights ago?

716
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:08,581
Um... He had
an emergency patient.

717
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:10,876
I... He Ieft about 9:30.

718
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:12,614
So Walt
couldn't have done it.

719
00:34:12,688 --> 00:34:14,383
Handsome boys.

720
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:16,219
Thank you.

721
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:20,854
They Iook so much Iike you,
but I don't see any
resemblance to your husband.

722
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,695
They're from my
previous marriage.

723
00:34:26,836 --> 00:34:28,497
Where's their father?

724
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:34,167
Attica,
doing eight-to-ten years
for trying to kill me.

725
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:36,905
He's Iost his
parental rights.

726
00:34:37,046 --> 00:34:39,742
Walt adopted the boys.

727
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:43,216
Mrs. Massey,
how did you
meet your husband?

728
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:53,451
I put a personal ad
in the newspaper
and he answered it.

729
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:58,193
PIease forgive me
for asking this,

730
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:02,601
but how has your relationship
been with your husband Iately?

731
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,610
What's that got to do
with anything?

732
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:12,179
PIease. Mrs. Massey...

733
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:17,447
Walt is a good man,
our relationship
isn't about sex. It...

734
00:35:18,554 --> 00:35:24,857
He's a saint.
He rescued me
and my boys.

735
00:35:25,027 --> 00:35:28,690
Does he pay
attention to one boy
more than he does to another?

736
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:31,532
The elder one, Shawn.

737
00:35:32,702 --> 00:35:35,830
They're together all the time
when Walt is home.

738
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:44,302
Oh, my God,
what's he done?

739
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,274
Do you miss your
real dad, Shawn?

740
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:51,013
WaIt's our dad now.

741
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,789
And how do you
feel about that?

742
00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:56,825
My other dad
used to hit my mom.

743
00:35:56,993 --> 00:36:00,986
He didn't want to be
with me and Darren,
my Iittle brother.

744
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:05,124
We had to Iive
in a shelter
till Mom met Walt.

745
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:07,465
And what do you and Walt do?

746
00:36:07,537 --> 00:36:09,903
You know, we hang out,
go to ball games.

747
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,439
He coaches my soccer team.

748
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:14,601
STABLER: That's cool.

749
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:17,475
What do you do
when you're alone together?

750
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:25,912
He said I could
never tell anyone.

751
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:28,148
That they
wouldn't understand.

752
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:32,387
Shawn, Iook at me.

753
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:37,361
I do understand,

754
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:39,833
and there's no need
to be afraid.

755
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:47,208
Walt Iikes to stay with me.

756
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:52,077
STABLER: Okay. What do you
mean stay, like, stay where?

757
00:36:52,148 --> 00:36:55,117
At night in my room.

758
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:58,711
When did this start?

759
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:01,951
One night he just came in.

760
00:37:02,024 --> 00:37:05,551
He said he
wanted to be near me,
and he just climbed in.

761
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,200
Did he ever
touch you anywhere?

762
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:18,670
Not then.

763
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:22,233
How about now?

764
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:29,149
He says it's how fathers
are supposed to
Iove their sons.

765
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:36,816
Shawn, you need to know
that none of this
is your fault.

766
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:40,757
That what he is
doing is wrong.

767
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:52,037
I know, but Walt
takes care of my mom and

768
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:54,406
we don't have to live
in the shelter anymore.

769
00:37:57,913 --> 00:38:00,108
And my mom doesn't
get beat up anymore.

770
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,715
Walt really Ioves us.

771
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:45,158
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I've been dealing
with another case.

772
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:47,058
Am I under arrest?

773
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:49,188
Your colleagues dragged me
out of my office

774
00:38:49,265 --> 00:38:51,130
in front of my patients,
Iike I'm some criminal.

775
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,634
That was a huge mistake.
I'm really sorry about that.

776
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:56,331
They weren't
supposed to do that.

777
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:02,503
I saw you were
talking to Shawn.

778
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,514
He seems Iike
a really great kid.

779
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:10,848
What did he tell you?

780
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:16,952
Oh, you know,
how much you Iove him
and his mom.

781
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:18,653
Look, EIIiot,
we got to move on this.

782
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:22,858
Look, I told you I'm not
wasting my time with
that crap. You handle it.

783
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:24,229
You have it your way.

784
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,029
Have it my...

785
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:30,231
Have it my way.
I got this case,
got a 14-year-old girl,

786
00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:35,334
who's dating this
22-year-old guy,
completely consensual sex,

787
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:38,938
and they wanna
Iock this poor guy up
for statutory rape.

788
00:39:44,086 --> 00:39:47,544
He shouldn't be penalized
because of the girl's age.

789
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:50,456
She was expressing
natural sexual feelings.

790
00:39:52,428 --> 00:39:55,124
Well, I wish the people
who made the Iaws
realized that.

791
00:39:55,197 --> 00:39:59,099
It'd make my job
a hell of a Iot easier.

792
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:02,194
So, you agree?

793
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:03,670
Look, we're all
sexual beings.

794
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:08,369
Children, adults, you know.
That's why I'm thinking that

795
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:12,942
this is a misunderstanding.

796
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:17,278
What do you mean?

797
00:40:17,386 --> 00:40:18,580
(SIGHS)

798
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:24,723
Okay, my colleagues
brought you in here

799
00:40:24,794 --> 00:40:28,286
because they think that
you're sexually abusing
your boys.

800
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:32,528
Okay, now,
I've busted my share
of child abusers.

801
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,061
I'm not getting
that vibe from you.

802
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:41,341
I would never do anything
to hurt my boys Iike that.

803
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,536
I believe you.

804
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:46,106
I think we both understand
it's about Iove.

805
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:48,707
You Iove your boys.

806
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:51,376
You treat them with respect.

807
00:40:51,454 --> 00:40:53,251
Not Iike Bret Jansen.

808
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,982
He beat his sons.
He Iocked them up.

809
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,528
You treated Jos�,
you know what he did to him.

810
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,621
He had bruises
all over his body.

811
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:04,790
Jansen does not
Iove those boys.

812
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:08,303
Well, he forced
Ernesto and Jos�
to have sex with him.

813
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,165
Forcing them, well...

814
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:20,373
Between you and me,
I think Jansen got
what he deserved.

815
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:44,773
His punishment, it was
especially appropriate,
don't you think?

816
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,045
Do you know how
Jansen was killed?

817
00:41:54,116 --> 00:41:56,346
Oh, God.

818
00:41:56,886 --> 00:42:00,686
I just know that he
hurt those Iittle angels.

819
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,259
I think you know
more than that.

820
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:13,261
What's with this
tattoo that I've seen
in the videotape?

821
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:15,326
And what about that glass
from Jansen's apartment

822
00:42:15,404 --> 00:42:18,464
that we found
in your sneaker?

823
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:21,032
What am I, an idiot?

824
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,372
Come on.

825
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:26,340
You killed Jansen.

826
00:42:26,415 --> 00:42:28,349
He ruined it for everybody.

827
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:30,942
I had to make sure
he'd never hurt
another Iittle boy again.

828
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,783
And I'm gonna make sure
that you never do, either.

829
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:34,880
You're under arrest
for the murder of Jansen

830
00:42:35,024 --> 00:42:37,049
and for sexually
abusing your son.

831
00:42:37,126 --> 00:42:40,892
No. No.
I didn't force Shawny.

832
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:45,626
He seduced me.

833
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:49,734
How could I deny him?

834
00:42:52,508 --> 00:42:56,444
I never beat him Iike
Jansen beat his boys.

835
00:42:56,512 --> 00:42:59,106
It's not the same thing!

836
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:02,582
No, it's worse.
You have sex
with your stepson

837
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:05,882
and you don't think
there's anything
wrong with that?

838
00:43:07,556 --> 00:43:09,990
What kind of sick
bastard are you?
