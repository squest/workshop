1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:05,866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:10,077
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,636
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,341
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,345
DAVE: My girlfriend,

8
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,910
she hates that I do this.
She wants me to quit.

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,286
JOE: She won't complain
when you find her
that diamond ring.

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,346
'Cause that happens?

11
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,619
Oh, man!
You wouldn't believe

12
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,594
the stuff folks
throw away. Oh!

13
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,721
Oh, what the hell
is that?

14
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,026
I don't
smell nothing.

15
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,397
Oh, man, you're crazy.
That thing stinks.

16
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,028
It may smell bad,
but the pay is good.

17
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,765
Not good enough.

18
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:42,331
Break up that mass
before it jams
the grinder.

19
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,607
The damn thing's stuck.

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,977
Let me see that.

21
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,609
Is that a hand?
Holy mother of God.

22
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,753
M.E. says she's five,
maybe six years old.
Raped and murdered.

23
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:57,120
Came in with
a Ioad of garbage.

24
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,954
Where from?
Commercial dumpster.

25
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,324
Half the carting
companies in the city
offload here.

26
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,159
Is there any way to tell
which truck
brought the body in?

27
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,028
PIant manager says
they get more than
a hundred trucks

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,192
in here every day,

29
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,704
and they all dump in one heap
that feeds into the maw.

30
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,398
You see everything
on that belt?

31
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:14,839
Yeah, what about it?

32
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,002
Once the M.E. is done,
I want you to bag up
everything on it.

33
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,170
Swell.

34
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,770
WARNER: Cause of death
was Iigature strangulation.

35
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:22,076
And the sexual assault?

36
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,845
Injuries to the genitalia
show no signs of healing.

37
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,511
Raped close
to the time of death,

38
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,021
but that was a while ago.

39
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,888
Her skin is shriveled.
Mummification?

40
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,051
Exactly.

41
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,459
The body was stored
before it was dumped.

42
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,156
I'II know more
after an autopsy.

43
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,323
It'II be tough
to make an ID

44
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,866
with her face
damaged Iike that.

45
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:40,958
Definitely post-mortem,

46
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,469
probably from the
garbage truck blades.

47
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,631
She was a fighter.
Take a Iook at this.

48
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,543
BIonde hair.
Maybe she got a piece of him.

49
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,944
I sure hope so.

50
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,598
STABLER: Tell me
you've got his DNA.

51
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,032
Sorry. The blonde hairs
that were found in her hand

52
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,694
turned out to be synthetic.

53
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,795
From a wig?
Maybe.

54
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,396
I'm sending the fibers
over to the Iab

55
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,533
to be checked against
the FBI database.

56
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,167
We at Ieast know
how Iong ago she died?

57
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,007
Based on
the insect activity,

58
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,776
I'd say between
six and eight weeks ago.

59
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,909
Judging from
the mummification,

60
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,748
the body was kept
in a cool place.

61
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,685
Can we get an ID
from the dental records?

62
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,156
I doubt it. Look at this.

63
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,487
There's so much tooth decay,

64
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,756
it's unlikely
she ever saw a dentist.

65
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,888
We'II definitely need
a facial reconstruction.

66
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:21,162
I'II send the body to our
forensic anthropologist.

67
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,827
He'II also try
to raise fingerprints.

68
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,531
So that's it?

69
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:29,235
Except for a few details
that will break your heart.

70
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,834
Displacement of her
front teeth

71
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,845
suggests she sucked
her thumb.

72
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,574
And she Iiked jumping rope.

73
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,775
BENSON: How'd you get that?

74
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,442
The scuffed toes.

75
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,147
I ruined enough pairs
when I was her age.

76
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,780
A five-year-old
kid disappears

77
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,221
and nobody reports it?

78
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,349
We checked her dental x-rays

79
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,087
against every missing
five-to-seven-year-old

80
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,959
African-American girl
in the Tri-State. No match.

81
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,828
Someone snatches your kid,
you call 91 1.

82
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,162
Unless you don't want
anybody to know

83
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,293
that your kid's gone.

84
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,668
So we're thinking this girl
was raped and killed
in her own home?

85
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,730
If the perp is a parent,
it explains why
there's no report.

86
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,106
And if she's not in school,
she's the perfect victim.

87
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,737
Nobody outside the family
would even know she's missing.

88
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,304
We don't even know
where she's missing from.

89
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,111
The garbage might tell us.

90
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,549
The Iab should have
gone through it by now.

91
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,611
OIivia, EIIiot, quicker we get
her picture out there,

92
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,054
quicker somebody
recognizes her.

93
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,125
DR. CONSTANTINE:
Meet Cherish Doe.

94
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,687
STABLER: What, Jane Doe's
not good enough?

95
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,130
It's too impersonal.

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,224
A cute Iittle girl
with braids

97
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,702
deserves something better,
don't you think?

98
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,407
Femur Iength,
plus the Iack of
epiphyseal plate fusion,

99
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,137
I'd say Cherish can't be
more than six.

100
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,371
So were you able
to get prints?

101
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,209
Still working on it.

102
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,442
Do you want to share?

103
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,007
The fingertips
were too shriveled.

104
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,815
So you cut her hands off.

105
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,413
I disarticulated them.

106
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,550
They're soaking
in embalming fluid

107
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,786
to reinflate the tissue,

108
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,421
hopefully enough
to roll a print.

109
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,021
TREVOR: You guys
owe me big time.

110
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,998
You find an address
in all that swill?

111
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,126
No, but I did find
an unusual amount

112
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,760
of fast food wrappers,
coffee cups,

113
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,805
fish scraps
and stained cotton balls.

114
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,704
-Cotton balls?
-From a nail salon.

115
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,800
Yeah, which apparently
shares a dumpster

116
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,505
with a burger joint,
a coffee shop
and a fish market.

117
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,945
That Ieaves, what,
only a couple dozen places
for us to check out?

118
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,880
How many city blocks
we gonna have to walk?

119
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,942
None, if you can manage
to drag your asses
over to the computer.

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,112
I've plugged you
your coffee shops,

121
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,951
burger joints,
fish markets, nail salons

122
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,287
into the zoning
and business permit databases.

123
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,452
You still think Big Brother
isn't watching us?

124
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,927
Now we eliminate areas
where all the variables

125
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,793
don't coexist
in close proximity.

126
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,458
Well, the garbage
plant's way uptown

127
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,058
and the manager says

128
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,501
they only pick up dumpsters
from north of 96th Street.

129
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,562
No problem.
In goes the information...

130
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,005
And out comes one Iocation.

131
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,478
1 23rd and Lenox. There we go.

132
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,241
Bingo! Burger Land.
Nail salon.

133
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,477
There's Letty's
Coffee Shop

134
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,213
and the back
of the fish market.

135
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,084
Why do we always get
the trash detail?

136
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,124
'Cause we're the right men
for the job.

137
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,292
PIus we've got the will
and we got the skill.

138
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,629
BIoody bed sheet.

139
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,225
You think the bastard
wrapped her body in it?

140
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,292
Mmm-hmm.

141
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,636
AII those windows up there,
maybe somebody saw him.

142
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,003
CSU have any Iuck
with the dumpster?

143
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,339
FIN: The blood type
on the bed sheets

144
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,879
match the victim.
That's it.

145
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,209
MUNCH: Nothing on
the canvass, either.

146
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,373
Maybe our car will improve

147
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,438
once we get these
on the street.

148
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,882
WOMAN ON TV:
Police today are searching
for the killer...

149
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,613
Looks Iike somebody
beat us to it.
...of this little girl,

150
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,155
found in this
Upper Manhattan garbage plant.

151
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,350
The only clue
to the killer's identity,

152
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,861
Iong blonde hairs
found in the victim's
lifeless grasp.

153
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,419
How the hell
did they get that?

154
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,728
Somebody gave them the fiber.
That detail was our hold-back.

155
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,234
Now when every nut in town
starts making
false confessions,

156
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,702
we got no way
to screen them out.

157
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,397
BENSON: We must've passed out
a couple hundred flyers.

158
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,635
Nobody recognized her.

159
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,905
Are we wrong thinking
she's from the neighborhood?

160
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,413
Maybe he is.
He stored her body
for a month or two,

161
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,948
he dumps her in a place
close to his house.

162
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,381
I mean, where's he
gonna go with her?

163
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,975
Sounds Iike
he's in his comfort zone.

164
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,485
Paroled sex offenders?

165
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,886
We checked.
No pedophiles
registered in the area.

166
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,150
Who says he's registered?

167
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,748
We don't even know
if the perp's a stranger

168
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,088
or the Iittle girl's parent.

169
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,823
Or some transvestite
wearing a blonde wig.

170
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,364
MUNCH: We canvassed.
Nobody remembers seeing

171
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,367
a Iittle black girl
with a guy with blond hair.

172
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,300
Well, I guess that Ieak
to the media paid off.

173
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,928
Community Relations
just called,

174
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,530
there's a candlelight
vigil tonight for Cherish Doe.

175
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,165
How many times
have we collared predators

176
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,334
at their victims' funerals?

177
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,877
Let's flush him out.

178
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,778
Make sure he sees us,
maybe we'II see him.

179
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:31,908
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

180
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:36,684
REV. ALLASTAIR: Cherish Doe,
we gather here
to remember you.

181
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:41,251
A sweet, innocent child,
stolen from life too soon.

182
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,394
We stand here tonight
as your family,

183
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,525
until your own family
is found.

184
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,226
It's all clear
over here. EIIiot?
We will not forget.

185
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,037
Nothing on this side.

186
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,233
And we will not rest
until justice is done.

187
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,004
I call upon you

188
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,705
to search your memory
and your conscience.

189
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,242
Anything you recall

190
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,375
will be welcomed
by the police.

191
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,413
Thank you for your support.

192
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,689
We need every single lead
that you can provide.

193
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:18,288
Now if you recognize
Cherish Doe, please call us.

194
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:22,267
NYPD has set up
a confidential tip line.

195
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,496
We don't need your names,

196
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,970
but we do need
your information.

197
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,968
MUNCH: Did you get
anything yet?

198
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,805
MORALES: So far, no hits
on the facial recognition
software.

199
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,004
FIN: What's your database?

200
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,640
AII known sex offenders
citywide whose victims
were under 10.

201
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,774
Huang's suggestion.

202
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,784
Yeah, but there's no guarantee
his mug shot's in there.

203
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,912
I mean, some guys
molest dozens of kids
before they're caught.

204
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,514
Your positive
attitude's a real joy.

205
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,753
What's up with that
Iady in the blue?

206
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,730
Why is she Iooking
around Iike that?

207
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,390
Zoom in on that Iady,
right there.

208
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,729
MORALES: Got her.

209
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,637
Something ain't right.
I'II be right back.

210
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,207
REV. ALLASTAIR: Cherish Doe,
you walked among us

211
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,246
as a stranger. But now

212
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,907
we call you our own.

213
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,876
You are our daughter.

214
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,183
Detective Tutuola.
Can I help you?

215
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,654
I can't find my daughter.

216
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,712
Okay, Iet's go to the front

217
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,917
and make a missing
child announcement.

218
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,620
No, no. I don't mean here,
not tonight.

219
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,526
When?
I don't know when.

220
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,155
I'm not sure when.

221
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,223
Okay, okay. What's your name?

222
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,201
Violet Tremain.

223
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,329
I saw Cherish Doe on the news,
I had to come here...

224
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,569
She may be my Iittle girl.

225
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,803
She Iooks just Iike my Nina.

226
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,044
I just came back tonight.

227
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,280
I was gone
for five months upstate.

228
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,016
FIN: Doing time?

229
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,148
No, I...

230
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,717
I was in rehab.

231
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,328
I'm not a crack addict,
if that's what you think.

232
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,129
I'm a painter
and I do graphic design

233
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,499
to pay the bills.

234
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,095
I'm not judging you.

235
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,470
We were in a car accident.

236
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:11,238
My husband, Nina's father,
was killed and...

237
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,607
I messed up my back

238
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,080
and I couldn't work
without painkillers.

239
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,344
I got hooked,
but I'm clean now,
four months.

240
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,147
ACS took your daughter away.

241
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,188
I knew if I put Nina
in foster care

242
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,246
I might not get her back.

243
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,791
So I Ieft her with a neighbor.

244
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,087
Well, that shows
a Iot of trust

245
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,752
to Ieave your daughter
with a neighbor.

246
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,354
Mrs. Hawkins was Iike
a grandmother to Nina,

247
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,728
she watched her
ever since she was a baby

248
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,027
and never took a penny.

249
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,227
She Ioved Nina.

250
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,792
You check in on her?

251
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,834
I couldn't call from rehab,
so I wrote Ietters.

252
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:45,275
I started to worry
when a Ietter I sent
Iast week was returned.

253
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,539
And then I saw the news.

254
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,478
And you checked out of rehab.

255
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,311
No, I just Ieft.

256
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,444
I called Mrs. Hawkins,
the phone was disconnected.

257
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,978
I called another neighbor,
she said Mrs. Hawkins
was dead.

258
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,287
She passed away six weeks ago.

259
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,327
And no one knew
what happened to Nina.

260
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,628
Sit down.

261
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,167
You've got to tell me
more about Nina.

262
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,731
How old is she?

263
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,744
She's five.
Her birthday was Iast month.

264
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,878
She's smart.

265
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,314
She can't wait
to start school.

266
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,821
She's playing all the time.

267
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,181
The child has a Iot of energy.

268
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,056
She Iike to jump rope?

269
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,151
Yeah, all the time.

270
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,923
What about the dentist?
When was her Iast checkup?

271
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,557
A couple of years.

272
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,898
I freelance
and my husband didn't...

273
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,903
He didn't have
dental insurance.

274
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,667
It's my Nina, isn't it?

275
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,406
We don't know that for sure.

276
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,607
Well, I have to see her.
No, no...

277
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,116
No sense in getting ahead
of ourselves, okay?

278
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,482
Somebody probably
took her in

279
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,851
and didn't know
how to get in touch with you.

280
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,219
Then we have to Iook for her.

281
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,782
It's after 12:00.
There's nothing
we can do right now.

282
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,795
How can I get in touch
with you tomorrow?

283
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,764
I don't know, I haven't
figured that out yet.

284
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,761
Don't worry,
I'II take care of that.

285
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,904
Violet's telling the truth.

286
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,375
"Junkies Iie all the time."
Your words.

287
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,433
You didn't talk to her.

288
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,979
Then Iet her see the body.

289
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,039
The child had no face.
No mother can handle that.

290
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,846
MUNCH: Sounds Iike
you're Iacking
a Iittle objectivity.

291
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,011
Why? 'Cause I'm not
handling things your way?

292
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,146
The department
doesn't have a budget
for Violet's hotel room.

293
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,020
You're paying for it,
aren't you?
So what?

294
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,423
Well, I guess
she is kind of cute.

295
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,894
Look, somebody knows
who took Nina

296
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,055
after Mrs. Hawkins died.

297
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,065
We've gotta canvass
her neighborhood. Let's go.

298
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:49,296
I still think you ought to
Iet her view the body.

299
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,162
Are you coming or what?

300
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,763
How do you even know
she has a kid?

301
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,001
Maybe she's using Cherish Doe
for a handout.

302
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,441
I pulled the
birth certificate myself.

303
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,001
So back off.

304
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,410
Lover's quarrel?

305
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,572
Gonna be a domestic dispute

306
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,047
if Munch don't get
out of my face.

307
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,914
Look, why don't Fin and I
go canvass
Mrs. Hawkins' building?

308
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,783
Good idea. We got dozens
of new Ieads in Iast night,

309
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,220
Munch and I will prioritize
and assign them out.

310
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,258
Come on. Let's go.

311
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,259
OId Iady died
a month and a half ago,
heart attack,

312
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,658
on her way home
from the market.

313
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:16,753
Nina with her?

314
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,923
Smart Iittle girl,
called 911 from a payphone.

315
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,990
Here it is, 3B.

316
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,630
FIN: Who cleaned
this place out?

317
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:25,728
Salvation Army.

318
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,603
You called them?
Mrs. Hawkins' daughter did.

319
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,699
Said everything
in here was junk,
told me to Iet them in.

320
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:30,902
Okay, and what about Nina?

321
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,104
Mrs. Hawkins' daughter
take her?
Yeah, right.

322
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,613
She said just because
her mama took in strays

323
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,739
didn't mean she had to.

324
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,044
Said the child
was my problem.

325
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,709
FIN: You try to reach
Nina's mother?

326
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,049
Violet never said
where she was going.
What could I do?

327
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,557
I had to send her
to Child Welfare,
hope for the best.

328
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,426
AII Nina could tell me
was that her mother went away.

329
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,590
Mrs. Tremain
didn't Ieave any names

330
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,634
or phone numbers
of any of her relatives.

331
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,566
Under the circumstances,
we had to classify Nina

332
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:57,694
as an abandoned child.

333
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,398
Nina's mother
didn't abandon her.

334
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,633
She voluntarily entered
into a rehab program.

335
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,767
Well, then she
should have come to us

336
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,175
instead of Ieaving her child

337
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,304
with an elderly neighbor
in failing health.

338
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,144
We could have placed
Nina voluntarily
while Violet was away.

339
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,651
Your agency doesn't
always make it easy

340
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,380
for parents to get
their children back.

341
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,649
Well, children are often
better off in foster care

342
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,281
than they are being
raised by addicts.

343
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,588
Violet's cleaned up
and she wants
her daughter back.

344
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,355
Yeah. Well, that's for
the courts to decide.

345
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,589
Mrs. Tremain's
gonna have to prove

346
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,563
that she can provide
a stable home environment

347
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,792
before we can release Nina.

348
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,630
Where's Nina Iiving?

349
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,862
I won't release
that information

350
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,301
if you're planning
to take the mother

351
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,032
on an unauthorized home visit.

352
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,074
You see the resemblance
to Nina Tremain?

353
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,837
This Iittle girl was raped,
murdered and tossed
in a dumpster.

354
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,970
Don't get in my way, Iady.

355
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,648
I placed her
with Thelma Price.

356
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,246
BENSON: Mrs. Price?
Yes?

357
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,484
I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Tutuola.

358
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,823
We'd Iike to talk to you
about Nina Tremain.

359
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:55,919
She's not here.

360
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,553
FIN: Where is she?
I don't know.

361
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,326
Ask Children's Services.

362
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,799
They said that they
placed her with you.

363
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,200
You don't believe me?

364
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,034
Take a Iook.

365
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,971
That child was nothing
but trouble.

366
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,066
Hyperactive, no manners,

367
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,303
always making a mess.

368
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,902
Well, when did they take her?

369
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,277
Must have been
over a month ago.

370
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,839
Then why did
Nina's case worker
tell us you had her?

371
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,045
Hell if I know.
That woman is Iazy.

372
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,712
Never makes a home visit.

373
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,517
Well, I find it hard
to believe Mrs. Preston

374
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,785
would forget to tell us
she took Nina.

375
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,053
She didn't take her.

376
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,392
It was some white guy
with dark hair.

377
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,987
Did you get his name?

378
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,327
I told you it was a month ago.

379
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,891
You expect me
to remember that?

380
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,868
BENSON: When was the Iast time
you saw Nina Tremain?

381
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,998
I'm gonna have to
check the file.

382
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,371
You got a memory problem?

383
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,601
I think it was Iast week.

384
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:44,769
Wrong answer.

385
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,539
It's possible
that I missed a visit.

386
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,581
Or more than one.

387
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,741
Even if I did,
it's hardly a police matter.

388
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,841
Wrong again.

389
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,146
Well, when you can't
make a visit,

390
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,777
you ever send
a colleague to cover?

391
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,118
A guy, maybe?
No, never.

392
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,421
No, then can you explain
why your records say

393
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:03,122
that you visited her
Iast Tuesday,

394
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,858
and Thelma Price says
you didn't.

395
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:07,162
That woman's a Iiar.
You're the Iiar, Iady!

396
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,099
Hey, I want my union rep.
BENSON: Yeah?

397
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,502
Well, why don't you tell
your union rep
that Nina Tremain is missing

398
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:15,235
and that you haven't seen her
in six weeks.

399
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,709
You were responsible
for this child's safety,

400
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:20,042
and you didn't even bother
to check on her.

401
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:21,604
This is not my fault.
Whose fault is it?

402
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:22,706
Do you know
what my job is Iike?

403
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,841
How big of a caseload I have?

404
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,215
There's no way
I can see every child.

405
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:27,277
If you're Iooking
for sympathy, you're barking
up the wrong tree.

406
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:28,754
Thelma Price was a good
foster mother.

407
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,848
I thought Nina
would be all right.

408
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:37,895
How could they Iet someone
just walk off with my child?

409
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:41,059
We don't know, but we're doing
everything we can to find him.

410
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:42,898
Now I need your help.

411
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,232
Anything.

412
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:47,672
Do you have something
with Nina's
fingerprints on it?

413
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,006
We draw together all the time.
I keep her pictures with me.

414
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:57,450
I guess it's Iike
having her here.

415
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,277
PIease be careful,
they're all I have.

416
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,051
We'II take good care
of them, I promise.

417
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:09,622
Violet, is this
Nina's handprint?

418
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:10,755
Yeah.

419
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,396
We made that together
Iast Thanksgiving.

420
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,563
The mother
authenticates that it's
the child's handprint.

421
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,768
Will it work?
Let's see.

422
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:27,007
The anthropologist
sent the hand over,
it's finally ready to print.

423
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,580
Couldn't ask for better.

424
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,915
People did their jobs,
this wouldn't have happened.

425
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:34,215
Sorry guys,
prints don't match.

426
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,312
Are you sure?

427
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,913
Not even close.

428
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:42,789
So Nina's not the dead girl.

429
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,329
Nina Tremain
might still be alive.

430
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,698
Two Iittle girls,
Iook Iike sisters,
from the same neighborhood,

431
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:49,963
tell me that's a coincidence.

432
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:52,028
Same guy that killed Cherish
might have Nina.

433
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,006
Are we sure it's the same guy?

434
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:55,975
He's got dark hair
when he took Nina

435
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:58,238
and a blonde wig
when he killed Cherish.

436
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:00,610
Well, maybe he played dress-up
before he killed her.

437
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:02,979
Maybe it's not even
a blonde wig
we're Iooking for.

438
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,178
I gotta tell Violet
that Cherish Doe
isn't her daughter.

439
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,915
Cherish's real name
is Susie Marshall.

440
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:11,984
How'd you get that?

441
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,222
Computer kicked out a match
to a KidPrint card on file.

442
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:18,356
Grandmother had her printed
during Safety Week.

443
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:24,129
I always thought
this day would come,

444
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:26,571
but not to hear
my grandbaby is dead.

445
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,600
I thought it would be Ronnie.

446
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:30,735
Who?

447
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,302
My daughter. The junkie.

448
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:40,816
That's why you were
taking care of Susie?

449
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:45,019
Ronnie'd ask me
to baby-sit her for a night

450
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:47,356
and disappear for months.

451
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:51,262
Then she'd come home
clean and sober,

452
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,026
and beg me to give Susie back.

453
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:57,900
And this Iast time I agreed,

454
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:58,996
because I thought that Ronnie

455
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:02,099
had finally
straightened herself out.

456
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,376
When did you Iast see
your granddaughter?

457
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:08,574
About five or six months ago.

458
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:12,085
Weren't you worried
because it had been so Iong?

459
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:15,179
Honestly, I was relieved.

460
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:19,459
Ronnie came by and told me
that a man from Child Welfare

461
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,154
had taken her away.

462
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:29,095
A perfect stranger
shows up at your door,

463
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,330
says he's a social worker,

464
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,632
and you just
turn over your kid

465
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:32,763
without a second thought?

466
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,535
Predator profiles his victims,

467
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,235
the kids come from
a chaotic household,

468
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,743
he knows they're not
gonna question him.

469
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,075
Posing as a social worker
is the perfect cover.

470
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,614
Well, that's true for Nina,

471
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:45,049
but ACS has no record
of contacting Susie Marshall
or her mother.

472
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,586
There's gotta be
another connection.

473
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:48,645
Well, take your pick.

474
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,054
Our perv either knows the kids
or their mothers.

475
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,184
What do we know
about the fathers?

476
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,728
Well, we know
Nina's father is dead

477
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,424
and Susie's father
went back to Jamaica.

478
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:00,467
We got a rap sheet
on Ronnie Marshall yet?

479
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,469
String of arrests,
collared for shoplifting
three years ago.

480
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:06,529
Last known whereabouts,
strung out on the street.

481
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:08,541
Then we got to go back
to Violet.

482
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,167
Show her pictures
of Ronnie and Susie.

483
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,872
Maybe she can
connect the dots.

484
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:15,779
VIOLET:
I'd remember this girl.

485
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:19,148
She Iooks just Iike my Nina.
I'm sorry.

486
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,084
FIN: How about this woman?

487
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,025
That scar.
I've seen her before.
Where?

488
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:30,222
An NA meeting.
I remember thinking
someone cut up her face.

489
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:31,992
Which NA meetings
did you go to?

490
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:35,263
Five o'clock
at the Community Center,

491
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:38,897
St. Virgil's on Tuesdays,
a few others
when the urge hit.

492
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:40,907
Well, the whole point of NA

493
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:43,705
is total confidentiality,
it's first names only.

494
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,446
They're not gonna talk to us.

495
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,538
I bet they'd talk to you.

496
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,518
What do you mean?

497
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,782
Your story might convince
a 12-stepper to open up.

498
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,183
FIN: You in?

499
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:59,556
What's he doing?

500
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:02,221
I'd do anything
to get my baby back.

501
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,858
Whatever it takes
to find Nina.

502
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,525
I'II do anything
I can to help.

503
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,966
But I'm not
gonna put a civilian

504
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:11,163
in the middle
of a criminal investigation.

505
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:12,762
Whatever you're thinking,
don't.

506
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,205
Violet's our only way in.

507
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,709
Violet would be acting
as an agent of the police.

508
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,211
Any evidence she obtains
could be excluded in court.

509
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,713
We're not Iooking
for evidence, Counselor.

510
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,009
We're Iooking for a Iead.

511
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:23,709
Nina Tremain
might still be alive.

512
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,911
We're talking about
violating the confidentiality

513
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,476
of a drug treatment program.

514
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,114
AIex, I tell people in AA

515
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,021
things I wouldn't want
my best friend to know.

516
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:33,457
Now I'd be the first
to agree with you

517
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:35,859
but I don't see how making
an appeal could hurt.

518
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:39,797
I would prefer
to get the information
through Iegal channels.

519
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,868
I'II get a subpoena.
CRAGEN: For what?

520
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,369
NA doesn't keep
membership Iists or records.

521
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:46,269
You want to tell that woman
you care more about the Iaw

522
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,570
than the Iife of her child?

523
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,269
She's Iiving a parent's
worst nightmare.

524
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:53,370
You think I really
had to run a number on her?

525
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:55,509
AII right.

526
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:59,109
But the only way we do this
is the right way.

527
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:00,312
Open meetings only.

528
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:04,153
Disclose your presence
and don't Iet Violet
out of your sight.

529
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:10,229
The Ninth Step says,

530
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:11,286
we have to make amends

531
00:22:11,365 --> 00:22:13,959
to those harmed
by our addiction.

532
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,662
Well I... I harmed my baby.

533
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:25,578
Because I got high,
I couldn't take care of Nina,

534
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,944
and some monster
kidnapped her.

535
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:32,181
I have to find
Ronnie Marshall.

536
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:33,378
I think
she's been here before,

537
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:35,115
and she might
have some information.

538
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,850
Ain't that against the rules?

539
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:40,985
The only way I can get
my Iittle girl back
is with your help.

540
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:42,926
I have to find Ronnie.

541
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,896
This is her picture.

542
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:52,127
The same freak
who stole my Nina
murdered her daughter.

543
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:56,476
Time is running out.

544
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,774
If you know anything,
I am begging you to tell me.

545
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,541
Hey, what's the rush?
None of your business.

546
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:04,606
No, trust me,
it's my business.

547
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:05,709
I got nothing to say.

548
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,617
Then why are you running
Iike a Iittle scared rabbit?

549
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,315
I don't know nothing
about no missing kids.

550
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,880
But you do know
Ronnie Marshall.

551
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,118
I don't have to
tell you anything.

552
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:13,682
I respect
people's confidentiality.

553
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:15,092
How about respect
for the dead?

554
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:18,097
You think Ronnie
wants to attend her own
daughter's funeral?

555
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,894
This is for real?
It's not a scam?

556
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,094
You got my word.
I don't know, man,

557
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,397
people won't trust me
if I talk to a cop.

558
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,768
We never talked.

559
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,765
A place Ronnie and I
used to get high.

560
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:30,469
The Starlite Lounge.

561
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,335
Oh, yeah.
Ronnie used to come in.

562
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:34,472
Used to?

563
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:35,572
A while back.

564
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:37,947
Threw her out
for shooting up in the can.

565
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:40,486
Haven't seen her since.

566
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,488
Do you know
where we can find her?

567
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:44,751
I don't get personal
with the customers.

568
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:46,588
They pay, they drink,
they Ieave.

569
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,151
Any customers talk to Ronnie?

570
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:50,457
Only guys
who were drunk enough

571
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:52,294
to think
she Iooked good.

572
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,162
She'd go with a Ieper
for the price of a fix.

573
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,725
Any Iepers around here?

574
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:58,567
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

575
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,338
Hey, Pat!

576
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,068
You banged that
skanky chick once, right?
Ronnie?

577
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:05,338
The one with the scar?

578
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:08,210
Don't remind me.
This bitch boosted my wallet.

579
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:09,874
You go to her place?

580
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,783
Woman's shelter
don't allow guests.

581
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,445
We did it in a alley.

582
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,421
You know which shelter?

583
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:26,628
FIN: You see Ronnie anywhere?
VIOLET: No.

584
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,964
Wait. There she is.
This is Ronnie.

585
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,967
Ronnie Marshall?

586
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:39,469
Leave me alone.
I have a couple more hours.

587
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,138
Wake up, Ronnie.

588
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:45,114
Who the hell are you?

589
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,210
I'm a cop.
I didn't do nothing.

590
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:53,723
Who's she?
I'm Violet.

591
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,359
I'm Iooking for my daughter,
and I need your help.

592
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,790
Cost you twenty bucks,
I'II help you all you want.

593
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,201
We've got no time for games.

594
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,967
We think the same man
took your daughter.

595
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,905
No.

596
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:10,001
No. Social worker
took my baby.

597
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,070
That man
wasn't a social worker.

598
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:15,945
Oh, no? Who was he?

599
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:21,353
Look, I'm sorry,
but Susie's dead.

600
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:25,155
We found her body
two days ago.

601
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,357
She's better off.

602
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,794
That's how much you care
about your Iittle girl?

603
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:39,340
Come on, get your ass up.
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,701
You Iook Iike crap, Ronnie.

605
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,438
When are you
gonna Iet me out of here?

606
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:47,037
Orange juice.
You're gonna need it.

607
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:50,308
What do you want from me?

608
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:52,979
Description of the man
who took Susie
for a sketch artist.

609
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:55,249
I can't remember
back that far.
Can I go now, huh?

610
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:56,585
Look, I found your works.

611
00:25:56,658 --> 00:25:58,455
You don't cooperate,
I'm gonna bust you.

612
00:25:58,526 --> 00:25:59,959
What is your problem?

613
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:02,792
Your daughter's dead
and there's not one cell
in your junkie body

614
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:04,957
that gives a damn.

615
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,831
That man who took
my daughter was right.

616
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:10,200
I'm not fit to be a mom.

617
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:12,762
Susie deserved more than me.

618
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:16,204
Now she's gone,
and there's nothing
that I can do

619
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:19,371
that's gonna change that.

620
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:22,780
You could help us save
this other Iittle girl.

621
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,818
Make it right for Susie.

622
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:30,817
We got to get
a description of this guy.

623
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:32,484
You can do this.

624
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,050
(CRYING)

625
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,534
Thelma, Ronnie worked this up
with a sketch artist.

626
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:41,933
Does this Iook
Iike the man
who took Nina?

627
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:43,027
That's him.

628
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:45,402
There's got to be a connection
between this guy
and the three of you.

629
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:48,499
So both Ronnie and Violet
went to the same NA meeting.

630
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:49,770
Thelma, have you
ever been to one?

631
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:50,868
Never.

632
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:53,106
Maybe it wasn't the meetings,
but where they were held.

633
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:54,842
Ronnie and I
both went to St. Virgil's.

634
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,042
FIN: You go
to that church, Thelma?

635
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:57,778
No, First Baptist.

636
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:59,820
How about Haven House?
Never been there.

637
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:03,220
Ronnie, can you think
of anyplace else?
Anywhere at all?

638
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,553
Not really.

639
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:07,459
Come on, think.
Where did this guy see you?

640
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,123
Maybe at the Community Center
on Eighth Ave.

641
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,167
I stopped in there
a couple times.

642
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:16,863
I go there for Bingo Night.
Nina Iiked their playroom.

643
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,200
Oh, God,

644
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,797
I went to meetings there.
I took Nina with me.

645
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,880
He cut his hair
and shaved his beard,

646
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:29,143
and he never wore glasses,

647
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:30,946
but it could be Terry Jessup.

648
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,008
Who's that?

649
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:33,678
He worked here.
Quit a few months ago.

650
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:34,881
How Iong have you
known him?

651
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:37,823
Oh, most of his Iife.
He was a Iocal kid.

652
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,723
Just about grew up here.

653
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:43,059
Had a mother who was unstable.
Went on and off her meds.

654
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:44,462
ACS ever remove him?

655
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:46,022
Well, we called them
several times,

656
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,263
once when he had
a terrible burn
on his hand.

657
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:51,328
But, you know,
he told them
it was an accident.

658
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:52,600
What did Terry do here?

659
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:56,508
CIeaned up, you know,
took out the trash,
small repairs.

660
00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:58,238
He used to fix
the broken toys.

661
00:27:58,312 --> 00:28:00,212
That was his real passion.

662
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:03,078
So he was around
the kids?

663
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:05,585
He had quite
a doll collection.

664
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:07,018
He Ioved showing it to them.

665
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:10,456
Strange hobby
for an adult man,
collecting dolls.

666
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,186
He inherited them
from his mother.

667
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,524
Terry called them his Iegacy.

668
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:16,028
We're gonna need
to talk to Terry.

669
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:17,462
Do you have
an address for him?

670
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:21,263
I can't imagine
that Terry's in trouble
with the police.

671
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:23,735
Do you recognize
this Iittle girl?

672
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:26,797
That's Cherish Doe,
from the news?

673
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,240
Her real name
is Susie Marshall

674
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,743
and the other one
is Nina Tremain.

675
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,143
Oh, my God.

676
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:35,377
You do recognize them.

677
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,747
Just to say hi.

678
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:38,817
I can't believe it.

679
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,945
Did you ever see Terry
around either one of them?

680
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:42,182
No.

681
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:44,121
But he did pay
special attention

682
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:46,922
to the kids
with tough home Iives.

683
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:49,519
He said that they
needed extra Iove.

684
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:54,898
Damn it! We're too Iate.

685
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:58,663
Here we go.

686
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,935
The paper's
three months old.

687
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:03,670
Jessup must have taken off
after he kidnapped Susie.

688
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:05,940
He's got to have another place
where he stashed Susie's body

689
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,914
before he dumped her.

690
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:10,644
Got something over here.

691
00:29:10,718 --> 00:29:13,482
Polaroid?

692
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:14,646
Susie Marshall.

693
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:17,020
Yeah, dressed up
Iike a Iittle doll.

694
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:25,461
Dolls are idealized
representations
of men and women.

695
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,865
They're pure,
perfect and sexless.

696
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,232
Terry Jessup
is Iike a child

697
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:31,203
who uses dolls
to act out his fantasies.

698
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:33,467
But he's a grown man
and his fantasies are sexual.

699
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,634
And he feels guilty
about being attracted
to children

700
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,541
and so he turns them
into dolls.

701
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:38,704
Which works for a while...

702
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,340
Until he gives in,
he has sex with the doll,

703
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:43,815
but then it's not
a doll anymore,
so he kills it.

704
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:45,045
Why stash the body?

705
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,711
Again, out of guilt.

706
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:48,278
And then when he finds
a new playmate,

707
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:49,914
he just discards the Iast one.

708
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,117
STABLER: Talked to your friend
at Bellevue,

709
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:53,387
got me the psych records
on Jessup's mother.

710
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:54,758
Diagnosed with
severe depression

711
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,694
with intermittent
bouts of mania.

712
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:58,595
She'd go around having
sex with dozens of men

713
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:02,568
and then go on
these spending sprees
buying nothing but dolls.

714
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:03,763
Give you anything on Jessup?

715
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:04,964
Well, the shrink said
that she was

716
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,564
intermittently abusive
and seductive towards him.

717
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:10,008
Perfect way
to raise a serial killer.

718
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:12,011
I talked to a couple
of Jessup's neighbors.

719
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,740
The stress of his mother's
death a year ago

720
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:15,214
pushed him over the edge.

721
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:17,148
He became reclusive
and explosive.

722
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:19,311
I just got off with CSU.

723
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:22,823
No forensic evidence
either Nina or Susie
were in Jessup's apartment.

724
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,982
Well, to keep
the girls prisoner,

725
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:26,322
Jessup would have
needed privacy and isolation.

726
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:27,952
STABLER: He snatched
both girls in the 'hood,

727
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,826
dumped Susie back there.

728
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:33,424
If he's following a pattern,
Nina's got to be nearby.

729
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,162
TREVOR: Check this out.

730
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:36,863
Moving in?

731
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:40,169
My own doll collection.

732
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:42,607
Fibers came from
a Madame Charlotte doll.

733
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:43,701
Very exclusive.

734
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:46,076
CRAGEN: Well, how exclusive
is their distribution?

735
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:48,115
Only three stores in the city.

736
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:53,118
Sure, I've known
Terry Jessup for years.

737
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,586
Not a Iot of guys
are into collecting,

738
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:55,644
but his money's good.

739
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:56,849
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

740
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:57,516
Oh, it's a couple
of months ago.

741
00:30:57,593 --> 00:31:00,221
He came in to buy
the new Princess AIexis.

742
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:02,923
Craftsmanship,
that's what Terry cares about.

743
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:05,296
Only perfect dolls
in mint condition.

744
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:06,891
We need an address for him.

745
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:08,527
I send mailings
to preferred customers

746
00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:11,004
whenever a new
Madame Charlotte comes out.

747
00:31:11,073 --> 00:31:14,201
Here we go.
2555 Eighth Avenue.

748
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:16,141
That's his old apartment.

749
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:17,542
Avid collector Iike Terry

750
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:19,513
surely sent you
a change of address.

751
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:20,639
No.

752
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,481
But he called
a couple of weeks ago.

753
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:25,213
Pre-ordered a Virginia Belle.

754
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:27,482
Left a number for me to call
when it came in.

755
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:30,684
917 area. Cell phone.

756
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,660
Call Terry and tell him
his order came in.

757
00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:50,602
Terry, I'm sorry.
(SOFTLY) He just came in.

758
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:54,137
What's wrong?
After I called you,
I opened the box.

759
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:55,911
The shipment was damaged.

760
00:31:55,984 --> 00:31:58,077
Would you take
a Princess Renee instead?

761
00:31:58,153 --> 00:31:59,415
You know
I don't collect Renees.

762
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,251
The workmanship's shoddy.

763
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:04,850
How about
a 50th anniversary Nicolette,
Iimited edition?

764
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:13,966
Okay, but I still want
the Virginia Belle.

765
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:16,266
Promise. I'II call you.
Okay.

766
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:25,206
He's on the move.

767
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,165
STABLER: Police!
Let's see your hands.

768
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:50,932
Don't hurt me.
Don't move.

769
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:52,405
Where is she, Terry?
What?

770
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,942
On your knees.
Nina Tremain,
where is she?

771
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,307
Nina?
Tell us where Nina is,

772
00:32:56,378 --> 00:32:58,005
before I take
your punk ass head off.

773
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,342
I don't know.
STABLER: Hey, Terry.

774
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:00,711
Terry!
Where's the top sheet?

775
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:03,046
Did you use this to wrap up
Susie Marshall's body?

776
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:04,847
Terry!

777
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,547
PIease don't hurt my dolls.

778
00:33:08,323 --> 00:33:10,086
PIease don't.
Tell us where Nina is.

779
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,353
She's not here!

780
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:13,985
Get his ass up.

781
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,194
We ran Iine-ups.

782
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:21,929
We got positive IDs
from Thelma Price and Ronnie.

783
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:23,028
Nice job.

784
00:33:23,105 --> 00:33:24,970
I don't need a confession
to win this case.

785
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,440
But we do need one
to find Nina Tremain.

786
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:29,306
Any chance
she's still alive?

787
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:31,608
Warner couldn't pin down
the exact time
of death for Susie.

788
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,079
AII we know is that
he kept her breathing

789
00:33:33,148 --> 00:33:34,581
between two and four weeks.

790
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:36,708
And we're at
the four-week mark
with Nina right now.

791
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:38,275
If he killed her,
he'd be agitated.

792
00:33:38,353 --> 00:33:39,820
He'd be on the prowl
for his next victim,

793
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:43,346
instead, he's in there
sleeping Iike a baby.

794
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:45,120
You know what?
Why don't you all
take a Iittle walk

795
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:46,660
while Terry and I
get better acquainted.

796
00:33:46,728 --> 00:33:48,662
Now, he's not going
to respond to threats.

797
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,826
He's very Ionely.
Dolls and children
are his only companions.

798
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:54,562
He needs a friend.

799
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:57,262
Your dolls are beautiful.

800
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:58,898
I had Iots of dolls,

801
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:02,068
but never ones
as nice as yours.

802
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:05,340
Girls are Iucky.

803
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:08,747
They can play with dolls.
Boys aren't supposed to.

804
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,250
I had dolls.

805
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,410
You did? What kind?

806
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:13,818
You know,
GI Joe, Batman...

807
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,756
Those are action figures.

808
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,890
Terry, I hear that your mother
started your doll collection.

809
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:23,988
She Iiked beautiful things.

810
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:25,931
I inherited them
when she died.

811
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:27,468
And you Iove them very much.

812
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:29,697
They were her most
precious possession.

813
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:32,171
Now they're mine.
She can't take them
away from me.

814
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,572
BENSON: Your mother
didn't want you
to have the dolls?

815
00:34:34,643 --> 00:34:36,042
She'd hit me
if I touched them.

816
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:38,477
She said that I'd break them.

817
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:41,641
"Boys are too rough.
Boys can't be trusted

818
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,343
"to handle fragile things."

819
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:47,551
But sometimes,
when she was really happy,

820
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:50,416
she'd Iet me dress them up.

821
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:53,787
I was very careful
not to break them.

822
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:59,229
I bet you take
really good care
of those dolls.

823
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:02,200
And I hear
that you fix them, too.

824
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,135
Yeah, I can fix anything.

825
00:35:04,206 --> 00:35:06,731
I'm really good with my hands.

826
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:09,038
Man, that burn
must have hurt.

827
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:13,347
It was an accident.
BENSON:
Did your mother do that?

828
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:14,882
She Ioved me.

829
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:21,153
But Iittle boys are wicked.
Little boys need discipline.

830
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:24,021
But your mother
had no right to hurt you.

831
00:35:25,861 --> 00:35:27,692
Little children deserve
to be Ioved.

832
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:31,425
Bad mothers shouldn't bring
Iittle children
into this world.

833
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,990
Susie Marshall
have a bad mother?

834
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:35,127
She was a crack whore.

835
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:38,072
Susie was sad all the time.

836
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,630
I Iet her play with my dolls.

837
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:41,005
Is that why
you took her, Terry?

838
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:43,101
So she could play with you?

839
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:44,873
In the Center,
she Ioved my dolls,

840
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:46,413
but then she didn't want
to play anymore.

841
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:47,778
She just wanted to go home.

842
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:50,249
And that must've
made you mad.

843
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:53,118
She broke one of my dolls.

844
00:35:53,188 --> 00:35:55,679
I told her not to,
I told her that she'd be sorry

845
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:55,746
but she wouldn't Iisten.

846
00:35:55,825 --> 00:35:58,157
That's when Susie got hurt?

847
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:02,126
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

848
00:36:02,198 --> 00:36:03,688
Where did you keep Susie?

849
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:05,097
I can't tell you.

850
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:06,965
BENSON: Okay, Terry. Okay.

851
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:11,372
Well, then
Iet's talk about Nina.

852
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:14,500
No.

853
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:17,679
Terry, Nina has
a good mother.

854
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:19,305
No, she doesn't.

855
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:22,613
I saw her Ieave Nina
with that evil woman.

856
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:24,346
I saw that woman
yelling at Nina.

857
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,820
Terry, Nina's mother
came back.

858
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,815
She misses her
and wants to see her again.

859
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:31,917
I know what
you're trying to do.

860
00:36:31,994 --> 00:36:33,154
You're trying to trick me.

861
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:36,164
Terry, where is Nina?
Where is Nina?

862
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,834
Where is she?

863
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:46,602
He's completely dissociated.
Just give him some time.

864
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:48,735
We don't have any time.
It's too Iate.

865
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,142
VIOLET: Detective Tutuola.

866
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:52,511
Violet, what are you
doing here?

867
00:36:52,582 --> 00:36:56,780
Fin called me. He told me
that you have the man
who took Nina.

868
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:58,376
We have a suspect in custody.

869
00:36:58,454 --> 00:36:59,751
Who won't talk.

870
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:01,619
I've got to see him.

871
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:03,785
Give us a minute.

872
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:07,359
I thought we were working
this case together

873
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,057
and you called Violet
without telling me?

874
00:37:09,131 --> 00:37:10,826
You got another way
to get Jessup to talk?

875
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,562
Putting Violet and Jessup
together is a bad idea.

876
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:15,763
She was strong enough
to go to those NA meetings.

877
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:17,863
We prep her correctly,
I know she can handle it.

878
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,840
Back me up, Doc.

879
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:22,377
Jessup thinks he's saving Nina
from an abusive parent.

880
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:24,572
If you challenge his delusion,
he might break.

881
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:25,807
And if this doesn't work,

882
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:27,940
the guilt
will destroy Violet's Iife.

883
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:30,952
A dead child's gonna
destroy her even more.

884
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,853
Nina's gonna die
if we don't do something.

885
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:48,594
You sure you can do this?

886
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:51,865
Yes.

887
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:56,136
No matter what he says,
you have to be
stronger than him.

888
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:07,886
I'm ready.

889
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,449
Hello, Terry.

890
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:23,802
Do you know who I am?

891
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:29,942
Nina's mom?

892
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,970
That's right.

893
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,345
My name is Violet.

894
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:42,424
You ran away.

895
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:44,322
Nina was so sad.

896
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:48,258
I was sad, too.

897
00:38:48,331 --> 00:38:50,265
I missed her very much.

898
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:54,261
But I Ieft to help Nina.

899
00:38:54,337 --> 00:38:56,862
I was no good to her
the way I was.

900
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:05,280
That's why
Violet came back, Terry.

901
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:07,282
She came back for Nina.

902
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,582
It's too Iate.

903
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:16,022
FIN: No, it's not.

904
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:19,653
Nina needs her mother.
Make it right.

905
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:26,130
Nina's a good girl.

906
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:28,769
Yes, she is.

907
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:33,569
I'm a good mother.

908
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:39,508
Do you Iove her?
Yes.

909
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:46,244
With her gone,
it's Iike a knife in my heart.

910
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,477
I have another place.

911
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:32,763
Bastard's playing us.

912
00:40:34,303 --> 00:40:37,704
Maybe not. Trap door. EIIiot.

913
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,075
Nina?

914
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,448
It's okay, baby.

915
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:03,024
It's okay, baby.
I'm a police officer.

916
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,030
(GROANING)

917
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,592
I got you. It's okay, baby.
You okay, baby? Look at me.

918
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:13,734
Look at me, baby, Iook. Okay.
I'II get you out of here.

919
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:15,939
I miss my Mommy.

920
00:41:16,011 --> 00:41:17,273
I'II take you home.

921
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:27,278
She'II be all right.

922
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:28,846
Mommy?

923
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:37,864
Thank you.
