1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:04,866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:09,077
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:12,636
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,341
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,345
DAVE: My girlfriend,

8
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,910
she hates that I do this.
She wants me to quit.

9
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:22,286
JOE: She won't complain
when you find her
that diamond ring.

10
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:23,346
'Cause that happens?

11
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:24,619
Oh, man!
You wouldn't believe

12
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:27,594
the stuff folks
throw away. Oh!

13
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:29,721
Oh, what the hell
is that?

14
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:31,026
I don't
smell nothing.

15
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,397
Oh, man, you're crazy.
That thing stinks.

16
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:36,028
It may smell bad,
but the pay is good.

17
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:37,765
Not good enough.

18
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:41,331
Break up that mass
before it jams
the grinder.

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,607
The damn thing's stuck.

20
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,977
Let me see that.

21
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,609
Is that a hand?
Holy mother of God.

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,753
M.E. says she's five,
maybe six years old.
Raped and murdered.

23
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:56,120
Came in with
a Ioad of garbage.

24
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:57,954
Where from?
Commercial dumpster.

25
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,324
Half the carting
companies in the city
offload here.

26
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:03,159
Is there any way to tell
which truck
brought the body in?

27
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,028
PIant manager says
they get more than
a hundred trucks

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,192
in here every day,

29
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:09,704
and they all dump in one heap
that feeds into the maw.

30
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:12,398
You see everything
on that belt?

31
00:01:12,474 --> 00:01:13,839
Yeah, what about it?

32
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,002
Once the M.E. is done,
I want you to bag up
everything on it.

33
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:17,170
Swell.

34
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,770
WARNER: Cause of death
was Iigature strangulation.

35
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,076
And the sexual assault?

36
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,845
Injuries to the genitalia
show no signs of healing.

37
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,511
Raped close
to the time of death,

38
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:28,021
but that was a while ago.

39
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,888
Her skin is shriveled.
Mummification?

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,051
Exactly.

41
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:34,459
The body was stored
before it was dumped.

42
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,156
I'II know more
after an autopsy.

43
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,323
It'II be tough
to make an ID

44
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:38,866
with her face
damaged Iike that.

45
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:39,958
Definitely post-mortem,

46
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,469
probably from the
garbage truck blades.

47
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:45,631
She was a fighter.
Take a Iook at this.

48
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:51,543
BIonde hair.
Maybe she got a piece of him.

49
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:52,944
I sure hope so.

50
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,598
STABLER: Tell me
you've got his DNA.

51
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,032
Sorry. The blonde hairs
that were found in her hand

52
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,694
turned out to be synthetic.

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,795
From a wig?
Maybe.

54
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,396
I'm sending the fibers
over to the Iab

55
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:54,533
to be checked against
the FBI database.

56
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,167
We at Ieast know
how Iong ago she died?

57
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,007
Based on
the insect activity,

58
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,776
I'd say between
six and eight weeks ago.

59
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,909
Judging from
the mummification,

60
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,748
the body was kept
in a cool place.

61
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,685
Can we get an ID
from the dental records?

62
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:10,156
I doubt it. Look at this.

63
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,487
There's so much tooth decay,

64
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,756
it's unlikely
she ever saw a dentist.

65
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:16,888
We'II definitely need
a facial reconstruction.

66
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:20,162
I'II send the body to our
forensic anthropologist.

67
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:22,827
He'II also try
to raise fingerprints.

68
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:24,531
So that's it?

69
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:28,235
Except for a few details
that will break your heart.

70
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,834
Displacement of her
front teeth

71
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,845
suggests she sucked
her thumb.

72
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:33,574
And she Iiked jumping rope.

73
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,775
BENSON: How'd you get that?

74
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,442
The scuffed toes.

75
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,147
I ruined enough pairs
when I was her age.

76
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:41,780
A five-year-old
kid disappears

77
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:43,221
and nobody reports it?

78
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,349
We checked her dental x-rays

79
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,087
against every missing
five-to-seven-year-old

80
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:48,959
African-American girl
in the Tri-State. No match.

81
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,828
Someone snatches your kid,
you call 91 1.

82
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,162
Unless you don't want
anybody to know

83
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:54,293
that your kid's gone.

84
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:57,668
So we're thinking this girl
was raped and killed
in her own home?

85
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,730
If the perp is a parent,
it explains why
there's no report.

86
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:02,106
And if she's not in school,
she's the perfect victim.

87
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:04,737
Nobody outside the family
would even know she's missing.

88
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:07,304
We don't even know
where she's missing from.

89
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:09,111
The garbage might tell us.

90
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,549
The Iab should have
gone through it by now.

91
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:13,611
OIivia, EIIiot, quicker we get
her picture out there,

92
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:16,054
quicker somebody
recognizes her.

93
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:22,125
DR. CONSTANTINE:
Meet Cherish Doe.

94
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:23,687
STABLER: What, Jane Doe's
not good enough?

95
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,130
It's too impersonal.

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,224
A cute Iittle girl
with braids

97
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:29,702
deserves something better,
don't you think?

98
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:33,407
Femur Iength,
plus the Iack of
epiphyseal plate fusion,

99
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:36,137
I'd say Cherish can't be
more than six.

100
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:37,371
So were you able
to get prints?

101
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:40,209
Still working on it.

102
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:41,442
Do you want to share?

103
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:44,007
The fingertips
were too shriveled.

104
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:46,815
So you cut her hands off.

105
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:49,413
I disarticulated them.

106
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:51,550
They're soaking
in embalming fluid

107
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:52,786
to reinflate the tissue,

108
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:55,421
hopefully enough
to roll a print.

109
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,021
TREVOR: You guys
owe me big time.

110
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,998
You find an address
in all that swill?

111
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,126
No, but I did find
an unusual amount

112
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,760
of fast food wrappers,
coffee cups,

113
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,805
fish scraps
and stained cotton balls.

114
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:06,704
-Cotton balls?
-From a nail salon.

115
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:08,800
Yeah, which apparently
shares a dumpster

116
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:11,505
with a burger joint,
a coffee shop
and a fish market.

117
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,945
That Ieaves, what,
only a couple dozen places
for us to check out?

118
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:15,880
How many city blocks
we gonna have to walk?

119
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,942
None, if you can manage
to drag your asses
over to the computer.

120
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,112
I've plugged you
your coffee shops,

121
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:21,951
burger joints,
fish markets, nail salons

122
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,287
into the zoning
and business permit databases.

123
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,452
You still think Big Brother
isn't watching us?

124
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:27,927
Now we eliminate areas
where all the variables

125
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,793
don't coexist
in close proximity.

126
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,458
Well, the garbage
plant's way uptown

127
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,058
and the manager says

128
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:36,501
they only pick up dumpsters
from north of 96th Street.

129
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,562
No problem.
In goes the information...

130
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:43,005
And out comes one Iocation.

131
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:45,478
1 23rd and Lenox. There we go.

132
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,241
Bingo! Burger Land.
Nail salon.

133
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:50,477
There's Letty's
Coffee Shop

134
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,213
and the back
of the fish market.

135
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:54,084
Why do we always get
the trash detail?

136
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:57,124
'Cause we're the right men
for the job.

137
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:05,292
PIus we've got the will
and we got the skill.

138
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:06,629
BIoody bed sheet.

139
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,225
You think the bastard
wrapped her body in it?

140
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:09,292
Mmm-hmm.

141
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:12,636
AII those windows up there,
maybe somebody saw him.

142
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:16,003
CSU have any Iuck
with the dumpster?

143
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,339
FIN: The blood type
on the bed sheets

144
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:18,879
match the victim.
That's it.

145
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:20,209
MUNCH: Nothing on
the canvass, either.

146
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:21,373
Maybe our car will improve

147
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,438
once we get these
on the street.

148
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:23,882
WOMAN ON TV:
Police today are searching
for the killer...

149
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:25,613
Looks Iike somebody
beat us to it.
...of this little girl,

150
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:28,155
found in this
Upper Manhattan garbage plant.

151
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,350
The only clue
to the killer's identity,

152
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:33,861
Iong blonde hairs
found in the victim's
lifeless grasp.

153
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,419
How the hell
did they get that?

154
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:38,728
Somebody gave them the fiber.
That detail was our hold-back.

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,234
Now when every nut in town
starts making
false confessions,

156
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,702
we got no way
to screen them out.

157
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,397
BENSON: We must've passed out
a couple hundred flyers.

158
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,635
Nobody recognized her.

159
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,905
Are we wrong thinking
she's from the neighborhood?

160
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,413
Maybe he is.
He stored her body
for a month or two,

161
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,948
he dumps her in a place
close to his house.

162
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,381
I mean, where's he
gonna go with her?

163
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,975
Sounds Iike
he's in his comfort zone.

164
00:06:58,052 --> 00:06:59,485
Paroled sex offenders?

165
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:01,886
We checked.
No pedophiles
registered in the area.

166
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,150
Who says he's registered?

167
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:04,748
We don't even know
if the perp's a stranger

168
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:06,088
or the Iittle girl's parent.

169
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,823
Or some transvestite
wearing a blonde wig.

170
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,364
MUNCH: We canvassed.
Nobody remembers seeing

171
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,367
a Iittle black girl
with a guy with blond hair.

172
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:15,300
Well, I guess that Ieak
to the media paid off.

173
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,928
Community Relations
just called,

174
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,530
there's a candlelight
vigil tonight for Cherish Doe.

175
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,165
How many times
have we collared predators

176
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:22,334
at their victims' funerals?

177
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,877
Let's flush him out.

178
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:26,778
Make sure he sees us,
maybe we'II see him.

179
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:30,908
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

180
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:35,684
REV. ALLASTAIR: Cherish Doe,
we gather here
to remember you.

181
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:40,251
A sweet, innocent child,
stolen from life too soon.

182
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:44,394
We stand here tonight
as your family,

183
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,525
until your own family
is found.

184
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:49,226
It's all clear
over here. EIIiot?
We will not forget.

185
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:51,037
Nothing on this side.

186
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:54,233
And we will not rest
until justice is done.

187
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:56,004
I call upon you

188
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:58,705
to search your memory
and your conscience.

189
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,242
Anything you recall

190
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:03,375
will be welcomed
by the police.

191
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:09,413
Thank you for your support.

192
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:13,689
We need every single lead
that you can provide.

193
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:17,288
Now if you recognize
Cherish Doe, please call us.

194
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:21,267
NYPD has set up
a confidential tip line.

195
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:22,496
We don't need your names,

196
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,970
but we do need
your information.

197
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,968
MUNCH: Did you get
anything yet?

198
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,805
MORALES: So far, no hits
on the facial recognition
software.

199
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,004
FIN: What's your database?

200
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,640
AII known sex offenders
citywide whose victims
were under 10.

201
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:35,774
Huang's suggestion.

202
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,784
Yeah, but there's no guarantee
his mug shot's in there.

203
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:40,912
I mean, some guys
molest dozens of kids
before they're caught.

204
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:43,514
Your positive
attitude's a real joy.

205
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,753
What's up with that
Iady in the blue?

206
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,730
Why is she Iooking
around Iike that?

207
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,390
Zoom in on that Iady,
right there.

208
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:53,729
MORALES: Got her.

209
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,637
Something ain't right.
I'II be right back.

210
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:02,207
REV. ALLASTAIR: Cherish Doe,
you walked among us

211
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:05,246
as a stranger. But now

212
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:08,907
we call you our own.

213
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:11,876
You are our daughter.

214
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:14,183
Detective Tutuola.
Can I help you?

215
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:15,654
I can't find my daughter.

216
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,712
Okay, Iet's go to the front

217
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,917
and make a missing
child announcement.

218
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,620
No, no. I don't mean here,
not tonight.

219
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:22,526
When?
I don't know when.

220
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,155
I'm not sure when.

221
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,223
Okay, okay. What's your name?

222
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,201
Violet Tremain.

223
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,329
I saw Cherish Doe on the news,
I had to come here...

224
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:34,569
She may be my Iittle girl.

225
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,803
She Iooks just Iike my Nina.

226
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,044
I just came back tonight.

227
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,280
I was gone
for five months upstate.

228
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:49,016
FIN: Doing time?

229
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,148
No, I...

230
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,717
I was in rehab.

231
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:58,328
I'm not a crack addict,
if that's what you think.

232
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,129
I'm a painter
and I do graphic design

233
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:02,499
to pay the bills.

234
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,095
I'm not judging you.

235
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:06,470
We were in a car accident.

236
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,238
My husband, Nina's father,
was killed and...

237
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:13,607
I messed up my back

238
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,080
and I couldn't work
without painkillers.

239
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,344
I got hooked,
but I'm clean now,
four months.

240
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:19,147
ACS took your daughter away.

241
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,188
I knew if I put Nina
in foster care

242
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,246
I might not get her back.

243
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:24,791
So I Ieft her with a neighbor.

244
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,087
Well, that shows
a Iot of trust

245
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,752
to Ieave your daughter
with a neighbor.

246
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:30,354
Mrs. Hawkins was Iike
a grandmother to Nina,

247
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:31,728
she watched her
ever since she was a baby

248
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,027
and never took a penny.

249
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:34,227
She Ioved Nina.

250
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,792
You check in on her?

251
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,834
I couldn't call from rehab,
so I wrote Ietters.

252
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:44,275
I started to worry
when a Ietter I sent
Iast week was returned.

253
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:45,539
And then I saw the news.

254
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:47,478
And you checked out of rehab.

255
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,311
No, I just Ieft.

256
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:52,444
I called Mrs. Hawkins,
the phone was disconnected.

257
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,978
I called another neighbor,
she said Mrs. Hawkins
was dead.

258
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:58,287
She passed away six weeks ago.

259
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,327
And no one knew
what happened to Nina.

260
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,628
Sit down.

261
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,167
You've got to tell me
more about Nina.

262
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:14,731
How old is she?

263
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:17,744
She's five.
Her birthday was Iast month.

264
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,878
She's smart.

265
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,314
She can't wait
to start school.

266
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,821
She's playing all the time.

267
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,181
The child has a Iot of energy.

268
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,056
She Iike to jump rope?

269
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,151
Yeah, all the time.

270
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,923
What about the dentist?
When was her Iast checkup?

271
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,557
A couple of years.

272
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:41,898
I freelance
and my husband didn't...

273
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,903
He didn't have
dental insurance.

274
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,667
It's my Nina, isn't it?

275
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:52,406
We don't know that for sure.

276
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,607
Well, I have to see her.
No, no...

277
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,116
No sense in getting ahead
of ourselves, okay?

278
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:58,482
Somebody probably
took her in

279
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,851
and didn't know
how to get in touch with you.

280
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,219
Then we have to Iook for her.

281
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,782
It's after 12:00.
There's nothing
we can do right now.

282
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,795
How can I get in touch
with you tomorrow?

283
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:11,764
I don't know, I haven't
figured that out yet.

284
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,761
Don't worry,
I'II take care of that.

285
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:20,904
Violet's telling the truth.

286
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,375
"Junkies Iie all the time."
Your words.

287
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,433
You didn't talk to her.

288
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:25,979
Then Iet her see the body.

289
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,039
The child had no face.
No mother can handle that.

290
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:30,846
MUNCH: Sounds Iike
you're Iacking
a Iittle objectivity.

291
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,011
Why? 'Cause I'm not
handling things your way?

292
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,146
The department
doesn't have a budget
for Violet's hotel room.

293
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,020
You're paying for it,
aren't you?
So what?

294
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,423
Well, I guess
she is kind of cute.

295
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:41,894
Look, somebody knows
who took Nina

296
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,055
after Mrs. Hawkins died.

297
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:45,065
We've gotta canvass
her neighborhood. Let's go.

298
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:48,296
I still think you ought to
Iet her view the body.

299
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:51,162
Are you coming or what?

300
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,763
How do you even know
she has a kid?

301
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,001
Maybe she's using Cherish Doe
for a handout.

302
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:56,441
I pulled the
birth certificate myself.

303
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:58,001
So back off.

304
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,410
Lover's quarrel?

305
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,572
Gonna be a domestic dispute

306
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,047
if Munch don't get
out of my face.

307
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,914
Look, why don't Fin and I
go canvass
Mrs. Hawkins' building?

308
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,783
Good idea. We got dozens
of new Ieads in Iast night,

309
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,220
Munch and I will prioritize
and assign them out.

310
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,258
Come on. Let's go.

311
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,259
OId Iady died
a month and a half ago,
heart attack,

312
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,658
on her way home
from the market.

313
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:15,753
Nina with her?

314
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,923
Smart Iittle girl,
called 911 from a payphone.

315
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,990
Here it is, 3B.

316
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,630
FIN: Who cleaned
this place out?

317
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:24,728
Salvation Army.

318
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:26,603
You called them?
Mrs. Hawkins' daughter did.

319
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,699
Said everything
in here was junk,
told me to Iet them in.

320
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:29,902
Okay, and what about Nina?

321
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,104
Mrs. Hawkins' daughter
take her?
Yeah, right.

322
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,613
She said just because
her mama took in strays

323
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,739
didn't mean she had to.

324
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:36,044
Said the child
was my problem.

325
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:37,709
FIN: You try to reach
Nina's mother?

326
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:40,049
Violet never said
where she was going.
What could I do?

327
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:43,557
I had to send her
to Child Welfare,
hope for the best.

328
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:49,426
AII Nina could tell me
was that her mother went away.

329
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,590
Mrs. Tremain
didn't Ieave any names

330
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,634
or phone numbers
of any of her relatives.

331
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,566
Under the circumstances,
we had to classify Nina

332
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:56,694
as an abandoned child.

333
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,398
Nina's mother
didn't abandon her.

334
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,633
She voluntarily entered
into a rehab program.

335
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,767
Well, then she
should have come to us

336
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,175
instead of Ieaving her child

337
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:06,304
with an elderly neighbor
in failing health.

338
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,144
We could have placed
Nina voluntarily
while Violet was away.

339
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,651
Your agency doesn't
always make it easy

340
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,380
for parents to get
their children back.

341
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:15,649
Well, children are often
better off in foster care

342
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:17,281
than they are being
raised by addicts.

343
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,588
Violet's cleaned up
and she wants
her daughter back.

344
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,355
Yeah. Well, that's for
the courts to decide.

345
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,589
Mrs. Tremain's
gonna have to prove

346
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,563
that she can provide
a stable home environment

347
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,792
before we can release Nina.

348
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,630
Where's Nina Iiving?

349
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:28,862
I won't release
that information

350
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,301
if you're planning
to take the mother

351
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,032
on an unauthorized home visit.

352
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:34,074
You see the resemblance
to Nina Tremain?

353
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,837
This Iittle girl was raped,
murdered and tossed
in a dumpster.

354
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,970
Don't get in my way, Iady.

355
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,648
I placed her
with Thelma Price.

356
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:49,246
BENSON: Mrs. Price?
Yes?

357
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,484
I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Tutuola.

358
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,823
We'd Iike to talk to you
about Nina Tremain.

359
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:54,919
She's not here.

360
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,553
FIN: Where is she?
I don't know.

361
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:58,326
Ask Children's Services.

362
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,799
They said that they
placed her with you.

363
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,200
You don't believe me?

364
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:05,034
Take a Iook.

365
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:06,971
That child was nothing
but trouble.

366
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,066
Hyperactive, no manners,

367
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,303
always making a mess.

368
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:11,902
Well, when did they take her?

369
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,277
Must have been
over a month ago.

370
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,839
Then why did
Nina's case worker
tell us you had her?

371
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:19,045
Hell if I know.
That woman is Iazy.

372
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,712
Never makes a home visit.

373
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:22,517
Well, I find it hard
to believe Mrs. Preston

374
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,785
would forget to tell us
she took Nina.

375
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:26,053
She didn't take her.

376
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:29,392
It was some white guy
with dark hair.

377
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,987
Did you get his name?

378
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:32,327
I told you it was a month ago.

379
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,891
You expect me
to remember that?

380
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,868
BENSON: When was the Iast time
you saw Nina Tremain?

381
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:39,998
I'm gonna have to
check the file.

382
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:41,371
You got a memory problem?

383
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,601
I think it was Iast week.

384
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:43,769
Wrong answer.

385
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:45,539
It's possible
that I missed a visit.

386
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,581
Or more than one.

387
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:49,741
Even if I did,
it's hardly a police matter.

388
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:50,841
Wrong again.

389
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,146
Well, when you can't
make a visit,

390
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,777
you ever send
a colleague to cover?

391
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:56,118
A guy, maybe?
No, never.

392
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:59,421
No, then can you explain
why your records say

393
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:02,122
that you visited her
Iast Tuesday,

394
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,858
and Thelma Price says
you didn't.

395
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:06,162
That woman's a Iiar.
You're the Iiar, Iady!

396
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:08,099
Hey, I want my union rep.
BENSON: Yeah?

397
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,502
Well, why don't you tell
your union rep
that Nina Tremain is missing

398
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:14,235
and that you haven't seen her
in six weeks.

399
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,709
You were responsible
for this child's safety,

400
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,042
and you didn't even bother
to check on her.

401
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:20,604
This is not my fault.
Whose fault is it?

402
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:21,706
Do you know
what my job is Iike?

403
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:22,841
How big of a caseload I have?

404
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,215
There's no way
I can see every child.

405
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,277
If you're Iooking
for sympathy, you're barking
up the wrong tree.

406
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:27,754
Thelma Price was a good
foster mother.

407
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,848
I thought Nina
would be all right.

408
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:36,895
How could they Iet someone
just walk off with my child?

409
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:40,059
We don't know, but we're doing
everything we can to find him.

410
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:41,898
Now I need your help.

411
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,232
Anything.

412
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:46,672
Do you have something
with Nina's
fingerprints on it?

413
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,006
We draw together all the time.
I keep her pictures with me.

414
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:56,450
I guess it's Iike
having her here.

415
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:00,277
PIease be careful,
they're all I have.

416
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:03,051
We'II take good care
of them, I promise.

417
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:08,622
Violet, is this
Nina's handprint?

418
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:09,755
Yeah.

419
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,396
We made that together
Iast Thanksgiving.

420
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:19,563
The mother
authenticates that it's
the child's handprint.

421
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,768
Will it work?
Let's see.

422
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:26,007
The anthropologist
sent the hand over,
it's finally ready to print.

423
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,580
Couldn't ask for better.

424
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,915
People did their jobs,
this wouldn't have happened.

425
00:17:31,987 --> 00:17:33,215
Sorry guys,
prints don't match.

426
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:34,312
Are you sure?

427
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:35,913
Not even close.

428
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:41,789
So Nina's not the dead girl.

429
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:45,329
Nina Tremain
might still be alive.

430
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,698
Two Iittle girls,
Iook Iike sisters,
from the same neighborhood,

431
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:48,963
tell me that's a coincidence.

432
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,028
Same guy that killed Cherish
might have Nina.

433
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,006
Are we sure it's the same guy?

434
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,975
He's got dark hair
when he took Nina

435
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:57,238
and a blonde wig
when he killed Cherish.

436
00:17:57,312 --> 00:17:59,610
Well, maybe he played dress-up
before he killed her.

437
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,979
Maybe it's not even
a blonde wig
we're Iooking for.

438
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,178
I gotta tell Violet
that Cherish Doe
isn't her daughter.

439
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:07,915
Cherish's real name
is Susie Marshall.

440
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:10,984
How'd you get that?

441
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,222
Computer kicked out a match
to a KidPrint card on file.

442
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:17,356
Grandmother had her printed
during Safety Week.

443
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:23,129
I always thought
this day would come,

444
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,571
but not to hear
my grandbaby is dead.

445
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:28,600
I thought it would be Ronnie.

446
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:29,735
Who?

447
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:32,302
My daughter. The junkie.

448
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:39,816
That's why you were
taking care of Susie?

449
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:44,019
Ronnie'd ask me
to baby-sit her for a night

450
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,356
and disappear for months.

451
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:50,262
Then she'd come home
clean and sober,

452
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,026
and beg me to give Susie back.

453
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,900
And this Iast time I agreed,

454
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:57,996
because I thought that Ronnie

455
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:01,099
had finally
straightened herself out.

456
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,376
When did you Iast see
your granddaughter?

457
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:07,574
About five or six months ago.

458
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:11,085
Weren't you worried
because it had been so Iong?

459
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:14,179
Honestly, I was relieved.

460
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:18,459
Ronnie came by and told me
that a man from Child Welfare

461
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,154
had taken her away.

462
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:28,095
A perfect stranger
shows up at your door,

463
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,330
says he's a social worker,

464
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:30,632
and you just
turn over your kid

465
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:31,763
without a second thought?

466
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,535
Predator profiles his victims,

467
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,235
the kids come from
a chaotic household,

468
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,743
he knows they're not
gonna question him.

469
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:39,075
Posing as a social worker
is the perfect cover.

470
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,614
Well, that's true for Nina,

471
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:44,049
but ACS has no record
of contacting Susie Marshall
or her mother.

472
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,586
There's gotta be
another connection.

473
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,645
Well, take your pick.

474
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:50,054
Our perv either knows the kids
or their mothers.

475
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,184
What do we know
about the fathers?

476
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,728
Well, we know
Nina's father is dead

477
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:56,424
and Susie's father
went back to Jamaica.

478
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,467
We got a rap sheet
on Ronnie Marshall yet?

479
00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:01,469
String of arrests,
collared for shoplifting
three years ago.

480
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:04,529
Last known whereabouts,
strung out on the street.

481
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:06,541
Then we got to go back
to Violet.

482
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,167
Show her pictures
of Ronnie and Susie.

483
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:10,872
Maybe she can
connect the dots.

484
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:13,779
VIOLET:
I'd remember this girl.

485
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:17,148
She Iooks just Iike my Nina.
I'm sorry.

486
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:20,084
FIN: How about this woman?

487
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,025
That scar.
I've seen her before.
Where?

488
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:28,222
An NA meeting.
I remember thinking
someone cut up her face.

489
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:29,992
Which NA meetings
did you go to?

490
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:33,263
Five o'clock
at the Community Center,

491
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:36,897
St. Virgil's on Tuesdays,
a few others
when the urge hit.

492
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:38,907
Well, the whole point of NA

493
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,705
is total confidentiality,
it's first names only.

494
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:44,446
They're not gonna talk to us.

495
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:46,538
I bet they'd talk to you.

496
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,518
What do you mean?

497
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:52,782
Your story might convince
a 12-stepper to open up.

498
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:55,183
FIN: You in?

499
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:57,556
What's he doing?

500
00:20:57,627 --> 00:21:00,221
I'd do anything
to get my baby back.

501
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:03,858
Whatever it takes
to find Nina.

502
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,525
I'II do anything
I can to help.

503
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:06,966
But I'm not
gonna put a civilian

504
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:09,163
in the middle
of a criminal investigation.

505
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:10,762
Whatever you're thinking,
don't.

506
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,205
Violet's our only way in.

507
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,709
Violet would be acting
as an agent of the police.

508
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:17,211
Any evidence she obtains
could be excluded in court.

509
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,713
We're not Iooking
for evidence, Counselor.

510
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:20,009
We're Iooking for a Iead.

511
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:21,709
Nina Tremain
might still be alive.

512
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:23,911
We're talking about
violating the confidentiality

513
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:25,476
of a drug treatment program.

514
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:28,114
AIex, I tell people in AA

515
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,021
things I wouldn't want
my best friend to know.

516
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:31,457
Now I'd be the first
to agree with you

517
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:33,859
but I don't see how making
an appeal could hurt.

518
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:37,797
I would prefer
to get the information
through Iegal channels.

519
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,868
I'II get a subpoena.
CRAGEN: For what?

520
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:42,369
NA doesn't keep
membership Iists or records.

521
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:44,269
You want to tell that woman
you care more about the Iaw

522
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,570
than the Iife of her child?

523
00:21:46,642 --> 00:21:48,269
She's Iiving a parent's
worst nightmare.

524
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:51,370
You think I really
had to run a number on her?

525
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:53,509
AII right.

526
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:57,109
But the only way we do this
is the right way.

527
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:58,312
Open meetings only.

528
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:02,153
Disclose your presence
and don't Iet Violet
out of your sight.

529
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:08,229
The Ninth Step says,

530
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:09,286
we have to make amends

531
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:11,959
to those harmed
by our addiction.

532
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:15,662
Well I... I harmed my baby.

533
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:23,578
Because I got high,
I couldn't take care of Nina,

534
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:25,944
and some monster
kidnapped her.

535
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:30,181
I have to find
Ronnie Marshall.

536
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:31,378
I think
she's been here before,

537
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:33,115
and she might
have some information.

538
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:34,850
Ain't that against the rules?

539
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:38,985
The only way I can get
my Iittle girl back
is with your help.

540
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,926
I have to find Ronnie.

541
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,896
This is her picture.

542
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:50,127
The same freak
who stole my Nina
murdered her daughter.

543
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:54,476
Time is running out.

544
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:57,774
If you know anything,
I am begging you to tell me.

545
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,541
Hey, what's the rush?
None of your business.

546
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:02,606
No, trust me,
it's my business.

547
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:03,709
I got nothing to say.

548
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:05,617
Then why are you running
Iike a Iittle scared rabbit?

549
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,315
I don't know nothing
about no missing kids.

550
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,880
But you do know
Ronnie Marshall.

551
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,118
I don't have to
tell you anything.

552
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:11,682
I respect
people's confidentiality.

553
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,092
How about respect
for the dead?

554
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:16,097
You think Ronnie
wants to attend her own
daughter's funeral?

555
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:17,894
This is for real?
It's not a scam?

556
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:20,094
You got my word.
I don't know, man,

557
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,397
people won't trust me
if I talk to a cop.

558
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,768
We never talked.

559
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,765
A place Ronnie and I
used to get high.

560
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:28,469
The Starlite Lounge.

561
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:31,335
Oh, yeah.
Ronnie used to come in.

562
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:32,472
Used to?

563
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:33,572
A while back.

564
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,947
Threw her out
for shooting up in the can.

565
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:38,486
Haven't seen her since.

566
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,488
Do you know
where we can find her?

567
00:23:40,556 --> 00:23:42,751
I don't get personal
with the customers.

568
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:44,588
They pay, they drink,
they Ieave.

569
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,151
Any customers talk to Ronnie?

570
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:48,457
Only guys
who were drunk enough

571
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:50,294
to think
she Iooked good.

572
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,162
She'd go with a Ieper
for the price of a fix.

573
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:54,725
Any Iepers around here?

574
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:56,567
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

575
00:23:57,973 --> 00:23:59,338
Hey, Pat!

576
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:02,068
You banged that
skanky chick once, right?
Ronnie?

577
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:03,338
The one with the scar?

578
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:06,210
Don't remind me.
This bitch boosted my wallet.

579
00:24:06,282 --> 00:24:07,874
You go to her place?

580
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,783
Woman's shelter
don't allow guests.

581
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:12,445
We did it in a alley.

582
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,421
You know which shelter?

583
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:24,628
FIN: You see Ronnie anywhere?
VIOLET: No.

584
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:28,964
Wait. There she is.
This is Ronnie.

585
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,967
Ronnie Marshall?

586
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:37,469
Leave me alone.
I have a couple more hours.

587
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:39,138
Wake up, Ronnie.

588
00:24:41,283 --> 00:24:43,114
Who the hell are you?

589
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:46,210
I'm a cop.
I didn't do nothing.

590
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:51,723
Who's she?
I'm Violet.

591
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:56,359
I'm Iooking for my daughter,
and I need your help.

592
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,790
Cost you twenty bucks,
I'II help you all you want.

593
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:02,201
We've got no time for games.

594
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:04,967
We think the same man
took your daughter.

595
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,905
No.

596
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:09,001
No. Social worker
took my baby.

597
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:12,070
That man
wasn't a social worker.

598
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:14,945
Oh, no? Who was he?

599
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:20,353
Look, I'm sorry,
but Susie's dead.

600
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:24,155
We found her body
two days ago.

601
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,357
She's better off.

602
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:34,794
That's how much you care
about your Iittle girl?

603
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:38,340
Come on, get your ass up.
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,701
You Iook Iike crap, Ronnie.

605
00:25:41,777 --> 00:25:43,438
When are you
gonna Iet me out of here?

606
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:46,037
Orange juice.
You're gonna need it.

607
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:49,308
What do you want from me?

608
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:51,979
Description of the man
who took Susie
for a sketch artist.

609
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:54,249
I can't remember
back that far.
Can I go now, huh?

610
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:55,585
Look, I found your works.

611
00:25:55,658 --> 00:25:56,455
You don't cooperate,
I'm gonna bust you.

612
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:57,959
What is your problem?

613
00:25:58,028 --> 00:26:00,792
Your daughter's dead
and there's not one cell
in your junkie body

614
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:02,957
that gives a damn.

615
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:05,831
That man who took
my daughter was right.

616
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:08,200
I'm not fit to be a mom.

617
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,762
Susie deserved more than me.

618
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:14,204
Now she's gone,
and there's nothing
that I can do

619
00:26:14,277 --> 00:26:17,371
that's gonna change that.

620
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:20,780
You could help us save
this other Iittle girl.

621
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,818
Make it right for Susie.

622
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:28,817
We got to get
a description of this guy.

623
00:26:28,892 --> 00:26:30,484
You can do this.

624
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,050
(CRYING)

625
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,534
Thelma, Ronnie worked this up
with a sketch artist.

626
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:39,933
Does this Iook
Iike the man
who took Nina?

627
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:41,027
That's him.

628
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:43,402
There's got to be a connection
between this guy
and the three of you.

629
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:46,499
So both Ronnie and Violet
went to the same NA meeting.

630
00:26:46,576 --> 00:26:47,770
Thelma, have you
ever been to one?

631
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:48,868
Never.

632
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:51,106
Maybe it wasn't the meetings,
but where they were held.

633
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:52,842
Ronnie and I
both went to St. Virgil's.

634
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,042
FIN: You go
to that church, Thelma?

635
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:55,778
No, First Baptist.

636
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:57,820
How about Haven House?
Never been there.

637
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:01,220
Ronnie, can you think
of anyplace else?
Anywhere at all?

638
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,553
Not really.

639
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,459
Come on, think.
Where did this guy see you?

640
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,123
Maybe at the Community Center
on Eighth Ave.

641
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:11,167
I stopped in there
a couple times.

642
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:14,863
I go there for Bingo Night.
Nina Iiked their playroom.

643
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:16,200
Oh, God,

644
00:27:16,272 --> 00:27:18,797
I went to meetings there.
I took Nina with me.

645
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,880
He cut his hair
and shaved his beard,

646
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:27,143
and he never wore glasses,

647
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:28,946
but it could be Terry Jessup.

648
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,008
Who's that?

649
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:31,678
He worked here.
Quit a few months ago.

650
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:32,881
How Iong have you
known him?

651
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:35,823
Oh, most of his Iife.
He was a Iocal kid.

652
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:37,723
Just about grew up here.

653
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:41,059
Had a mother who was unstable.
Went on and off her meds.

654
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:42,462
ACS ever remove him?

655
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:44,022
Well, we called them
several times,

656
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,263
once when he had
a terrible burn
on his hand.

657
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:49,328
But, you know,
he told them
it was an accident.

658
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:50,600
What did Terry do here?

659
00:27:50,674 --> 00:27:54,508
CIeaned up, you know,
took out the trash,
small repairs.

660
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:56,238
He used to fix
the broken toys.

661
00:27:56,312 --> 00:27:58,212
That was his real passion.

662
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:01,078
So he was around
the kids?

663
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:03,585
He had quite
a doll collection.

664
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:05,018
He Ioved showing it to them.

665
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:08,456
Strange hobby
for an adult man,
collecting dolls.

666
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,186
He inherited them
from his mother.

667
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,524
Terry called them his Iegacy.

668
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:14,028
We're gonna need
to talk to Terry.

669
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:15,462
Do you have
an address for him?

670
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:19,263
I can't imagine
that Terry's in trouble
with the police.

671
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:21,735
Do you recognize
this Iittle girl?

672
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:24,797
That's Cherish Doe,
from the news?

673
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:27,240
Her real name
is Susie Marshall

674
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,743
and the other one
is Nina Tremain.

675
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:30,143
Oh, my God.

676
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:33,377
You do recognize them.

677
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,747
Just to say hi.

678
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:36,817
I can't believe it.

679
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,945
Did you ever see Terry
around either one of them?

680
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:40,182
No.

681
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,121
But he did pay
special attention

682
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:44,922
to the kids
with tough home Iives.

683
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:47,519
He said that they
needed extra Iove.

684
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,898
Damn it! We're too Iate.

685
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:56,663
Here we go.

686
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,935
The paper's
three months old.

687
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,670
Jessup must have taken off
after he kidnapped Susie.

688
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:03,940
He's got to have another place
where he stashed Susie's body

689
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:06,914
before he dumped her.

690
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:08,644
Got something over here.

691
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:11,482
Polaroid?

692
00:29:11,554 --> 00:29:12,646
Susie Marshall.

693
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:15,020
Yeah, dressed up
Iike a Iittle doll.

694
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:23,461
Dolls are idealized
representations
of men and women.

695
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,865
They're pure,
perfect and sexless.

696
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:27,232
Terry Jessup
is Iike a child

697
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:29,203
who uses dolls
to act out his fantasies.

698
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:31,467
But he's a grown man
and his fantasies are sexual.

699
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,634
And he feels guilty
about being attracted
to children

700
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,541
and so he turns them
into dolls.

701
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:36,704
Which works for a while...

702
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,340
Until he gives in,
he has sex with the doll,

703
00:29:39,415 --> 00:29:41,815
but then it's not
a doll anymore,
so he kills it.

704
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:43,045
Why stash the body?

705
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,711
Again, out of guilt.

706
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:46,278
And then when he finds
a new playmate,

707
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:47,914
he just discards the Iast one.

708
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:49,117
STABLER: Talked to your friend
at Bellevue,

709
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:51,387
got me the psych records
on Jessup's mother.

710
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:52,758
Diagnosed with
severe depression

711
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,694
with intermittent
bouts of mania.

712
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:56,595
She'd go around having
sex with dozens of men

713
00:29:56,666 --> 00:30:00,568
and then go on
these spending sprees
buying nothing but dolls.

714
00:30:00,637 --> 00:30:01,763
Give you anything on Jessup?

715
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:02,964
Well, the shrink said
that she was

716
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,564
intermittently abusive
and seductive towards him.

717
00:30:05,642 --> 00:30:08,008
Perfect way
to raise a serial killer.

718
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:10,011
I talked to a couple
of Jessup's neighbors.

719
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,740
The stress of his mother's
death a year ago

720
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:13,214
pushed him over the edge.

721
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:15,148
He became reclusive
and explosive.

722
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:17,311
I just got off with CSU.

723
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:20,823
No forensic evidence
either Nina or Susie
were in Jessup's apartment.

724
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,982
Well, to keep
the girls prisoner,

725
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,322
Jessup would have
needed privacy and isolation.

726
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:25,952
STABLER: He snatched
both girls in the 'hood,

727
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,826
dumped Susie back there.

728
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:31,424
If he's following a pattern,
Nina's got to be nearby.

729
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:33,162
TREVOR: Check this out.

730
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:34,863
Moving in?

731
00:30:34,938 --> 00:30:38,169
My own doll collection.

732
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:40,607
Fibers came from
a Madame Charlotte doll.

733
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:41,701
Very exclusive.

734
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:44,076
CRAGEN: Well, how exclusive
is their distribution?

735
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:46,115
Only three stores in the city.

736
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:51,118
Sure, I've known
Terry Jessup for years.

737
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:52,586
Not a Iot of guys
are into collecting,

738
00:30:52,655 --> 00:30:53,644
but his money's good.

739
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:54,849
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

740
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:56,516
Oh, it's a couple
of months ago.

741
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:59,221
He came in to buy
the new Princess AIexis.

742
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:01,923
Craftsmanship,
that's what Terry cares about.

743
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:04,296
Only perfect dolls
in mint condition.

744
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:05,891
We need an address for him.

745
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:07,527
I send mailings
to preferred customers

746
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:10,004
whenever a new
Madame Charlotte comes out.

747
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:13,201
Here we go.
2555 Eighth Avenue.

748
00:31:13,276 --> 00:31:15,141
That's his old apartment.

749
00:31:15,211 --> 00:31:16,542
Avid collector Iike Terry

750
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,513
surely sent you
a change of address.

751
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:19,639
No.

752
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,481
But he called
a couple of weeks ago.

753
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:24,213
Pre-ordered a Virginia Belle.

754
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:26,482
Left a number for me to call
when it came in.

755
00:31:26,556 --> 00:31:29,684
917 area. Cell phone.

756
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,660
Call Terry and tell him
his order came in.

757
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:49,602
Terry, I'm sorry.
(SOFTLY) He just came in.

758
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,137
What's wrong?
After I called you,
I opened the box.

759
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:54,911
The shipment was damaged.

760
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:57,077
Would you take
a Princess Renee instead?

761
00:31:57,153 --> 00:31:58,415
You know
I don't collect Renees.

762
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:00,251
The workmanship's shoddy.

763
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:03,850
How about
a 50th anniversary Nicolette,
Iimited edition?

764
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:12,966
Okay, but I still want
the Virginia Belle.

765
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:15,266
Promise. I'II call you.
Okay.

766
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:24,206
He's on the move.

767
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:48,165
STABLER: Police!
Let's see your hands.

768
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:49,932
Don't hurt me.
Don't move.

769
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:51,405
Where is she, Terry?
What?

770
00:32:51,474 --> 00:32:53,942
On your knees.
Nina Tremain,
where is she?

771
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,307
Nina?
Tell us where Nina is,

772
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:57,005
before I take
your punk ass head off.

773
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,342
I don't know.
STABLER: Hey, Terry.

774
00:32:58,414 --> 00:32:59,711
Terry!
Where's the top sheet?

775
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:02,046
Did you use this to wrap up
Susie Marshall's body?

776
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:03,847
Terry!

777
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,547
PIease don't hurt my dolls.

778
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:09,086
PIease don't.
Tell us where Nina is.

779
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:11,353
She's not here!

780
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:12,985
Get his ass up.

781
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,194
We ran Iine-ups.

782
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,929
We got positive IDs
from Thelma Price and Ronnie.

783
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:22,028
Nice job.

784
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:23,970
I don't need a confession
to win this case.

785
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,440
But we do need one
to find Nina Tremain.

786
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:28,306
Any chance
she's still alive?

787
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:30,608
Warner couldn't pin down
the exact time
of death for Susie.

788
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,079
AII we know is that
he kept her breathing

789
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,581
between two and four weeks.

790
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,708
And we're at
the four-week mark
with Nina right now.

791
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,275
If he killed her,
he'd be agitated.

792
00:33:37,353 --> 00:33:38,820
He'd be on the prowl
for his next victim,

793
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:42,346
instead, he's in there
sleeping Iike a baby.

794
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:44,120
You know what?
Why don't you all
take a Iittle walk

795
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:45,660
while Terry and I
get better acquainted.

796
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,662
Now, he's not going
to respond to threats.

797
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,826
He's very Ionely.
Dolls and children
are his only companions.

798
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:53,562
He needs a friend.

799
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:56,262
Your dolls are beautiful.

800
00:33:56,806 --> 00:33:57,898
I had Iots of dolls,

801
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:01,068
but never ones
as nice as yours.

802
00:34:02,645 --> 00:34:04,340
Girls are Iucky.

803
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:07,747
They can play with dolls.
Boys aren't supposed to.

804
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:09,250
I had dolls.

805
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:11,410
You did? What kind?

806
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:12,818
You know,
GI Joe, Batman...

807
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,756
Those are action figures.

808
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,890
Terry, I hear that your mother
started your doll collection.

809
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:22,988
She Iiked beautiful things.

810
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:24,931
I inherited them
when she died.

811
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:26,468
And you Iove them very much.

812
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:28,697
They were her most
precious possession.

813
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:31,171
Now they're mine.
She can't take them
away from me.

814
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,572
BENSON: Your mother
didn't want you
to have the dolls?

815
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:35,042
She'd hit me
if I touched them.

816
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:37,477
She said that I'd break them.

817
00:34:37,547 --> 00:34:40,641
"Boys are too rough.
Boys can't be trusted

818
00:34:40,716 --> 00:34:42,343
"to handle fragile things."

819
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:46,551
But sometimes,
when she was really happy,

820
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:49,416
she'd Iet me dress them up.

821
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:52,787
I was very careful
not to break them.

822
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:58,229
I bet you take
really good care
of those dolls.

823
00:34:59,335 --> 00:35:01,200
And I hear
that you fix them, too.

824
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,135
Yeah, I can fix anything.

825
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:05,731
I'm really good with my hands.

826
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:08,038
Man, that burn
must have hurt.

827
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:12,347
It was an accident.
BENSON:
Did your mother do that?

828
00:35:12,415 --> 00:35:13,882
She Ioved me.

829
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:20,153
But Iittle boys are wicked.
Little boys need discipline.

830
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:23,021
But your mother
had no right to hurt you.

831
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:26,692
Little children deserve
to be Ioved.

832
00:35:26,762 --> 00:35:30,425
Bad mothers shouldn't bring
Iittle children
into this world.

833
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,990
Susie Marshall
have a bad mother?

834
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:34,127
She was a crack whore.

835
00:35:35,104 --> 00:35:37,072
Susie was sad all the time.

836
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,630
I Iet her play with my dolls.

837
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,005
Is that why
you took her, Terry?

838
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:42,101
So she could play with you?

839
00:35:42,178 --> 00:35:43,873
In the Center,
she Ioved my dolls,

840
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:45,413
but then she didn't want
to play anymore.

841
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:46,778
She just wanted to go home.

842
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:49,249
And that must've
made you mad.

843
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:52,118
She broke one of my dolls.

844
00:35:52,188 --> 00:35:54,679
I told her not to,
I told her that she'd be sorry

845
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:55,746
but she wouldn't Iisten.

846
00:35:55,825 --> 00:35:58,157
That's when Susie got hurt?

847
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:02,126
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

848
00:36:02,198 --> 00:36:03,688
Where did you keep Susie?

849
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:05,097
I can't tell you.

850
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:06,965
BENSON: Okay, Terry. Okay.

851
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:11,372
Well, then
Iet's talk about Nina.

852
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:14,500
No.

853
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:17,679
Terry, Nina has
a good mother.

854
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:19,305
No, she doesn't.

855
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:22,613
I saw her Ieave Nina
with that evil woman.

856
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:24,346
I saw that woman
yelling at Nina.

857
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,820
Terry, Nina's mother
came back.

858
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,815
She misses her
and wants to see her again.

859
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:31,917
I know what
you're trying to do.

860
00:36:31,994 --> 00:36:33,154
You're trying to trick me.

861
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:36,164
Terry, where is Nina?
Where is Nina?

862
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,834
Where is she?

863
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:46,602
He's completely dissociated.
Just give him some time.

864
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:48,735
We don't have any time.
It's too Iate.

865
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,142
VIOLET: Detective Tutuola.

866
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:52,511
Violet, what are you
doing here?

867
00:36:52,582 --> 00:36:56,780
Fin called me. He told me
that you have the man
who took Nina.

868
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:58,376
We have a suspect in custody.

869
00:36:58,454 --> 00:36:59,751
Who won't talk.

870
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:01,619
I've got to see him.

871
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:03,785
Give us a minute.

872
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:07,359
I thought we were working
this case together

873
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,057
and you called Violet
without telling me?

874
00:37:09,131 --> 00:37:10,826
You got another way
to get Jessup to talk?

875
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,562
Putting Violet and Jessup
together is a bad idea.

876
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:15,763
She was strong enough
to go to those NA meetings.

877
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:17,863
We prep her correctly,
I know she can handle it.

878
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,840
Back me up, Doc.

879
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:22,377
Jessup thinks he's saving Nina
from an abusive parent.

880
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:24,572
If you challenge his delusion,
he might break.

881
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:25,807
And if this doesn't work,

882
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:27,940
the guilt
will destroy Violet's Iife.

883
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:30,952
A dead child's gonna
destroy her even more.

884
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,853
Nina's gonna die
if we don't do something.

885
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:48,594
You sure you can do this?

886
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:51,865
Yes.

887
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:56,136
No matter what he says,
you have to be
stronger than him.

888
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:07,886
I'm ready.

889
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,449
Hello, Terry.

890
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:23,802
Do you know who I am?

891
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:29,942
Nina's mom?

892
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,970
That's right.

893
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,345
My name is Violet.

894
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:42,424
You ran away.

895
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:44,322
Nina was so sad.

896
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:48,258
I was sad, too.

897
00:38:48,331 --> 00:38:50,265
I missed her very much.

898
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:54,261
But I Ieft to help Nina.

899
00:38:54,337 --> 00:38:56,862
I was no good to her
the way I was.

900
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:05,280
That's why
Violet came back, Terry.

901
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:07,282
She came back for Nina.

902
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,582
It's too Iate.

903
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:16,022
FIN: No, it's not.

904
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:19,653
Nina needs her mother.
Make it right.

905
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:26,130
Nina's a good girl.

906
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:28,769
Yes, she is.

907
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:33,569
I'm a good mother.

908
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:39,508
Do you Iove her?
Yes.

909
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:46,244
With her gone,
it's Iike a knife in my heart.

910
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,477
I have another place.

911
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:32,763
Bastard's playing us.

912
00:40:34,303 --> 00:40:37,704
Maybe not. Trap door. EIIiot.

913
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,075
Nina?

914
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,448
It's okay, baby.

915
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:03,024
It's okay, baby.
I'm a police officer.

916
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,030
(GROANING)

917
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,592
I got you. It's okay, baby.
You okay, baby? Look at me.

918
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:13,734
Look at me, baby, Iook. Okay.
I'II get you out of here.

919
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:15,939
I miss my Mommy.

920
00:41:16,011 --> 00:41:17,273
I'II take you home.

921
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:27,278
She'II be all right.

922
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:28,846
Mommy?

923
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:37,864
Thank you.
