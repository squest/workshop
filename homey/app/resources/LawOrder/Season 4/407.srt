1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:03,866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:08,077
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:11,636
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:13,341
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:16,345
DAVE: My girlfriend,

8
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:18,910
she hates that I do this.
She wants me to quit.

9
00:00:18,988 --> 00:00:21,286
JOE: She won't complain
when you find her
that diamond ring.

10
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:22,346
'Cause that happens?

11
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:23,619
Oh, man!
You wouldn't believe

12
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:26,594
the stuff folks
throw away. Oh!

13
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:28,721
Oh, what the hell
is that?

14
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:30,026
I don't
smell nothing.

15
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,397
Oh, man, you're crazy.
That thing stinks.

16
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:35,028
It may smell bad,
but the pay is good.

17
00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:36,765
Not good enough.

18
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:40,331
Break up that mass
before it jams
the grinder.

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,607
The damn thing's stuck.

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,977
Let me see that.

21
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,609
Is that a hand?
Holy mother of God.

22
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,753
M.E. says she's five,
maybe six years old.
Raped and murdered.

23
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:55,120
Came in with
a Ioad of garbage.

24
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,954
Where from?
Commercial dumpster.

25
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:59,324
Half the carting
companies in the city
offload here.

26
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:02,159
Is there any way to tell
which truck
brought the body in?

27
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,028
PIant manager says
they get more than
a hundred trucks

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,192
in here every day,

29
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:08,704
and they all dump in one heap
that feeds into the maw.

30
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:11,398
You see everything
on that belt?

31
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:12,839
Yeah, what about it?

32
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,002
Once the M.E. is done,
I want you to bag up
everything on it.

33
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:16,170
Swell.

34
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:18,770
WARNER: Cause of death
was Iigature strangulation.

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,076
And the sexual assault?

36
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,845
Injuries to the genitalia
show no signs of healing.

37
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,511
Raped close
to the time of death,

38
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:27,021
but that was a while ago.

39
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,888
Her skin is shriveled.
Mummification?

40
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,051
Exactly.

41
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,459
The body was stored
before it was dumped.

42
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:35,156
I'II know more
after an autopsy.

43
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:36,323
It'II be tough
to make an ID

44
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:37,866
with her face
damaged Iike that.

45
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:38,958
Definitely post-mortem,

46
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:41,469
probably from the
garbage truck blades.

47
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:44,631
She was a fighter.
Take a Iook at this.

48
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,543
BIonde hair.
Maybe she got a piece of him.

49
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:51,944
I sure hope so.

50
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:43,598
STABLER: Tell me
you've got his DNA.

51
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,032
Sorry. The blonde hairs
that were found in her hand

52
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:47,694
turned out to be synthetic.

53
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,795
From a wig?
Maybe.

54
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,396
I'm sending the fibers
over to the Iab

55
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:53,533
to be checked against
the FBI database.

56
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,167
We at Ieast know
how Iong ago she died?

57
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:57,007
Based on
the insect activity,

58
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,776
I'd say between
six and eight weeks ago.

59
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,909
Judging from
the mummification,

60
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:04,748
the body was kept
in a cool place.

61
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,685
Can we get an ID
from the dental records?

62
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:09,156
I doubt it. Look at this.

63
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,487
There's so much tooth decay,

64
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,756
it's unlikely
she ever saw a dentist.

65
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:15,888
We'II definitely need
a facial reconstruction.

66
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:19,162
I'II send the body to our
forensic anthropologist.

67
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:21,827
He'II also try
to raise fingerprints.

68
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:23,531
So that's it?

69
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:27,235
Except for a few details
that will break your heart.

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,834
Displacement of her
front teeth

71
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,845
suggests she sucked
her thumb.

72
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:32,574
And she Iiked jumping rope.

73
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:34,775
BENSON: How'd you get that?

74
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,442
The scuffed toes.

75
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,147
I ruined enough pairs
when I was her age.

76
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:40,780
A five-year-old
kid disappears

77
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:42,221
and nobody reports it?

78
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,349
We checked her dental x-rays

79
00:03:43,426 --> 00:03:45,087
against every missing
five-to-seven-year-old

80
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,959
African-American girl
in the Tri-State. No match.

81
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,828
Someone snatches your kid,
you call 91 1.

82
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,162
Unless you don't want
anybody to know

83
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,293
that your kid's gone.

84
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,668
So we're thinking this girl
was raped and killed
in her own home?

85
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:58,730
If the perp is a parent,
it explains why
there's no report.

86
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:01,106
And if she's not in school,
she's the perfect victim.

87
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:03,737
Nobody outside the family
would even know she's missing.

88
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:06,304
We don't even know
where she's missing from.

89
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,111
The garbage might tell us.

90
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:09,549
The Iab should have
gone through it by now.

91
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:12,611
OIivia, EIIiot, quicker we get
her picture out there,

92
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:15,054
quicker somebody
recognizes her.

93
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:21,125
DR. CONSTANTINE:
Meet Cherish Doe.

94
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:22,687
STABLER: What, Jane Doe's
not good enough?

95
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:24,130
It's too impersonal.

96
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,224
A cute Iittle girl
with braids

97
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,702
deserves something better,
don't you think?

98
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:32,407
Femur Iength,
plus the Iack of
epiphyseal plate fusion,

99
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:35,137
I'd say Cherish can't be
more than six.

100
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,371
So were you able
to get prints?

101
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:39,209
Still working on it.

102
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:40,442
Do you want to share?

103
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:43,007
The fingertips
were too shriveled.

104
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:45,815
So you cut her hands off.

105
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:48,413
I disarticulated them.

106
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:50,550
They're soaking
in embalming fluid

107
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:51,786
to reinflate the tissue,

108
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,421
hopefully enough
to roll a print.

109
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:56,021
TREVOR: You guys
owe me big time.

110
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,998
You find an address
in all that swill?

111
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,126
No, but I did find
an unusual amount

112
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:01,760
of fast food wrappers,
coffee cups,

113
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:03,805
fish scraps
and stained cotton balls.

114
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:05,704
-Cotton balls?
-From a nail salon.

115
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:07,800
Yeah, which apparently
shares a dumpster

116
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:10,505
with a burger joint,
a coffee shop
and a fish market.

117
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,945
That Ieaves, what,
only a couple dozen places
for us to check out?

118
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,880
How many city blocks
we gonna have to walk?

119
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,942
None, if you can manage
to drag your asses
over to the computer.

120
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,112
I've plugged you
your coffee shops,

121
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:20,951
burger joints,
fish markets, nail salons

122
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,287
into the zoning
and business permit databases.

123
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,452
You still think Big Brother
isn't watching us?

124
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:26,927
Now we eliminate areas
where all the variables

125
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,793
don't coexist
in close proximity.

126
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:31,458
Well, the garbage
plant's way uptown

127
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:33,058
and the manager says

128
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:35,501
they only pick up dumpsters
from north of 96th Street.

129
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,562
No problem.
In goes the information...

130
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:42,005
And out comes one Iocation.

131
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,478
1 23rd and Lenox. There we go.

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,241
Bingo! Burger Land.
Nail salon.

133
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,477
There's Letty's
Coffee Shop

134
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,213
and the back
of the fish market.

135
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,084
Why do we always get
the trash detail?

136
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:56,124
'Cause we're the right men
for the job.

137
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,292
PIus we've got the will
and we got the skill.

138
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:05,629
BIoody bed sheet.

139
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:07,225
You think the bastard
wrapped her body in it?

140
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:08,292
Mmm-hmm.

141
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:11,636
AII those windows up there,
maybe somebody saw him.

142
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,003
CSU have any Iuck
with the dumpster?

143
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:16,339
FIN: The blood type
on the bed sheets

144
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:17,879
match the victim.
That's it.

145
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:19,209
MUNCH: Nothing on
the canvass, either.

146
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,373
Maybe our car will improve

147
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,438
once we get these
on the street.

148
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:22,882
WOMAN ON TV:
Police today are searching
for the killer...

149
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:24,613
Looks Iike somebody
beat us to it.
...of this little girl,

150
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:27,155
found in this
Upper Manhattan garbage plant.

151
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:29,350
The only clue
to the killer's identity,

152
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:32,861
Iong blonde hairs
found in the victim's
lifeless grasp.

153
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:35,419
How the hell
did they get that?

154
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,728
Somebody gave them the fiber.
That detail was our hold-back.

155
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,234
Now when every nut in town
starts making
false confessions,

156
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:42,702
we got no way
to screen them out.

157
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:45,397
BENSON: We must've passed out
a couple hundred flyers.

158
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:47,635
Nobody recognized her.

159
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,905
Are we wrong thinking
she's from the neighborhood?

160
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,413
Maybe he is.
He stored her body
for a month or two,

161
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:53,948
he dumps her in a place
close to his house.

162
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:55,381
I mean, where's he
gonna go with her?

163
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:56,975
Sounds Iike
he's in his comfort zone.

164
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:58,485
Paroled sex offenders?

165
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:00,886
We checked.
No pedophiles
registered in the area.

166
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:02,150
Who says he's registered?

167
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:03,748
We don't even know
if the perp's a stranger

168
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:05,088
or the Iittle girl's parent.

169
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:07,823
Or some transvestite
wearing a blonde wig.

170
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,364
MUNCH: We canvassed.
Nobody remembers seeing

171
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:12,367
a Iittle black girl
with a guy with blond hair.

172
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,300
Well, I guess that Ieak
to the media paid off.

173
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,928
Community Relations
just called,

174
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,530
there's a candlelight
vigil tonight for Cherish Doe.

175
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,165
How many times
have we collared predators

176
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:21,334
at their victims' funerals?

177
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,877
Let's flush him out.

178
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:25,778
Make sure he sees us,
maybe we'II see him.

179
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:29,908
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

180
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:34,684
REV. ALLASTAIR: Cherish Doe,
we gather here
to remember you.

181
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:39,251
A sweet, innocent child,
stolen from life too soon.

182
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:43,394
We stand here tonight
as your family,

183
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,525
until your own family
is found.

184
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:48,226
It's all clear
over here. EIIiot?
We will not forget.

185
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:50,037
Nothing on this side.

186
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:53,233
And we will not rest
until justice is done.

187
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,004
I call upon you

188
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,705
to search your memory
and your conscience.

189
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,242
Anything you recall

190
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:02,375
will be welcomed
by the police.

191
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,413
Thank you for your support.

192
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:12,689
We need every single lead
that you can provide.

193
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:16,288
Now if you recognize
Cherish Doe, please call us.

194
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:20,267
NYPD has set up
a confidential tip line.

195
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:21,496
We don't need your names,

196
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,970
but we do need
your information.

197
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,968
MUNCH: Did you get
anything yet?

198
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,805
MORALES: So far, no hits
on the facial recognition
software.

199
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:30,004
FIN: What's your database?

200
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,640
AII known sex offenders
citywide whose victims
were under 10.

201
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:34,774
Huang's suggestion.

202
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,784
Yeah, but there's no guarantee
his mug shot's in there.

203
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:39,912
I mean, some guys
molest dozens of kids
before they're caught.

204
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:42,514
Your positive
attitude's a real joy.

205
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:47,753
What's up with that
Iady in the blue?

206
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,730
Why is she Iooking
around Iike that?

207
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:51,390
Zoom in on that Iady,
right there.

208
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:52,729
MORALES: Got her.

209
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,637
Something ain't right.
I'II be right back.

210
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:01,207
REV. ALLASTAIR: Cherish Doe,
you walked among us

211
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:04,246
as a stranger. But now

212
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:07,907
we call you our own.

213
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:10,876
You are our daughter.

214
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,183
Detective Tutuola.
Can I help you?

215
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,654
I can't find my daughter.

216
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:15,712
Okay, Iet's go to the front

217
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,917
and make a missing
child announcement.

218
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:19,620
No, no. I don't mean here,
not tonight.

219
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,526
When?
I don't know when.

220
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:23,155
I'm not sure when.

221
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:25,223
Okay, okay. What's your name?

222
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:27,201
Violet Tremain.

223
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:30,329
I saw Cherish Doe on the news,
I had to come here...

224
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:33,569
She may be my Iittle girl.

225
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:35,803
She Iooks just Iike my Nina.

226
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:44,044
I just came back tonight.

227
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,280
I was gone
for five months upstate.

228
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:48,016
FIN: Doing time?

229
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,148
No, I...

230
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:52,717
I was in rehab.

231
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:57,328
I'm not a crack addict,
if that's what you think.

232
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,129
I'm a painter
and I do graphic design

233
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:01,499
to pay the bills.

234
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,095
I'm not judging you.

235
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,470
We were in a car accident.

236
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,238
My husband, Nina's father,
was killed and...

237
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:12,607
I messed up my back

238
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,080
and I couldn't work
without painkillers.

239
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,344
I got hooked,
but I'm clean now,
four months.

240
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:18,147
ACS took your daughter away.

241
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,188
I knew if I put Nina
in foster care

242
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:22,246
I might not get her back.

243
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:23,791
So I Ieft her with a neighbor.

244
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,087
Well, that shows
a Iot of trust

245
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,752
to Ieave your daughter
with a neighbor.

246
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,354
Mrs. Hawkins was Iike
a grandmother to Nina,

247
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:30,728
she watched her
ever since she was a baby

248
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,027
and never took a penny.

249
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,227
She Ioved Nina.

250
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:34,792
You check in on her?

251
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:39,834
I couldn't call from rehab,
so I wrote Ietters.

252
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:43,275
I started to worry
when a Ietter I sent
Iast week was returned.

253
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:44,539
And then I saw the news.

254
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,478
And you checked out of rehab.

255
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,311
No, I just Ieft.

256
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:51,444
I called Mrs. Hawkins,
the phone was disconnected.

257
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,978
I called another neighbor,
she said Mrs. Hawkins
was dead.

258
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,287
She passed away six weeks ago.

259
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,327
And no one knew
what happened to Nina.

260
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,628
Sit down.

261
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:12,167
You've got to tell me
more about Nina.

262
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:13,731
How old is she?

263
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,744
She's five.
Her birthday was Iast month.

264
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,878
She's smart.

265
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:23,314
She can't wait
to start school.

266
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:26,821
She's playing all the time.

267
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,181
The child has a Iot of energy.

268
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,056
She Iike to jump rope?

269
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:33,151
Yeah, all the time.

270
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,923
What about the dentist?
When was her Iast checkup?

271
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,557
A couple of years.

272
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:40,898
I freelance
and my husband didn't...

273
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,903
He didn't have
dental insurance.

274
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:49,667
It's my Nina, isn't it?

275
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,406
We don't know that for sure.

276
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,607
Well, I have to see her.
No, no...

277
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,116
No sense in getting ahead
of ourselves, okay?

278
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:57,482
Somebody probably
took her in

279
00:11:57,553 --> 00:11:59,851
and didn't know
how to get in touch with you.

280
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:01,219
Then we have to Iook for her.

281
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,782
It's after 12:00.
There's nothing
we can do right now.

282
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,795
How can I get in touch
with you tomorrow?

283
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:10,764
I don't know, I haven't
figured that out yet.

284
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:16,761
Don't worry,
I'II take care of that.

285
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:19,904
Violet's telling the truth.

286
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:22,375
"Junkies Iie all the time."
Your words.

287
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:23,433
You didn't talk to her.

288
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:24,979
Then Iet her see the body.

289
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:28,039
The child had no face.
No mother can handle that.

290
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:29,846
MUNCH: Sounds Iike
you're Iacking
a Iittle objectivity.

291
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,011
Why? 'Cause I'm not
handling things your way?

292
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:34,146
The department
doesn't have a budget
for Violet's hotel room.

293
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:36,020
You're paying for it,
aren't you?
So what?

294
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,423
Well, I guess
she is kind of cute.

295
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,894
Look, somebody knows
who took Nina

296
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:42,055
after Mrs. Hawkins died.

297
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:44,065
We've gotta canvass
her neighborhood. Let's go.

298
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:47,296
I still think you ought to
Iet her view the body.

299
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:50,162
Are you coming or what?

300
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,763
How do you even know
she has a kid?

301
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,001
Maybe she's using Cherish Doe
for a handout.

302
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,441
I pulled the
birth certificate myself.

303
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:57,001
So back off.

304
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,410
Lover's quarrel?

305
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,572
Gonna be a domestic dispute

306
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,047
if Munch don't get
out of my face.

307
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:03,914
Look, why don't Fin and I
go canvass
Mrs. Hawkins' building?

308
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:05,783
Good idea. We got dozens
of new Ieads in Iast night,

309
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:08,220
Munch and I will prioritize
and assign them out.

310
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,258
Come on. Let's go.

311
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,259
OId Iady died
a month and a half ago,
heart attack,

312
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,658
on her way home
from the market.

313
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:14,753
Nina with her?

314
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,923
Smart Iittle girl,
called 911 from a payphone.

315
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:18,990
Here it is, 3B.

316
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,630
FIN: Who cleaned
this place out?

317
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:23,728
Salvation Army.

318
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:25,603
You called them?
Mrs. Hawkins' daughter did.

319
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,699
Said everything
in here was junk,
told me to Iet them in.

320
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:28,902
Okay, and what about Nina?

321
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:31,104
Mrs. Hawkins' daughter
take her?
Yeah, right.

322
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,613
She said just because
her mama took in strays

323
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:33,739
didn't mean she had to.

324
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:35,044
Said the child
was my problem.

325
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:36,709
FIN: You try to reach
Nina's mother?

326
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:39,049
Violet never said
where she was going.
What could I do?

327
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:42,557
I had to send her
to Child Welfare,
hope for the best.

328
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:48,426
AII Nina could tell me
was that her mother went away.

329
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:50,590
Mrs. Tremain
didn't Ieave any names

330
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,634
or phone numbers
of any of her relatives.

331
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,566
Under the circumstances,
we had to classify Nina

332
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:55,694
as an abandoned child.

333
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:57,398
Nina's mother
didn't abandon her.

334
00:13:57,472 --> 00:13:59,633
She voluntarily entered
into a rehab program.

335
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,767
Well, then she
should have come to us

336
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:03,175
instead of Ieaving her child

337
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:05,304
with an elderly neighbor
in failing health.

338
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,144
We could have placed
Nina voluntarily
while Violet was away.

339
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:10,651
Your agency doesn't
always make it easy

340
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,380
for parents to get
their children back.

341
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:14,649
Well, children are often
better off in foster care

342
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,281
than they are being
raised by addicts.

343
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:18,588
Violet's cleaned up
and she wants
her daughter back.

344
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,355
Yeah. Well, that's for
the courts to decide.

345
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,589
Mrs. Tremain's
gonna have to prove

346
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:23,563
that she can provide
a stable home environment

347
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:24,792
before we can release Nina.

348
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,630
Where's Nina Iiving?

349
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:27,862
I won't release
that information

350
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,301
if you're planning
to take the mother

351
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,032
on an unauthorized home visit.

352
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:33,074
You see the resemblance
to Nina Tremain?

353
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:35,837
This Iittle girl was raped,
murdered and tossed
in a dumpster.

354
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:37,970
Don't get in my way, Iady.

355
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,648
I placed her
with Thelma Price.

356
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:48,246
BENSON: Mrs. Price?
Yes?

357
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:50,484
I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Tutuola.

358
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,823
We'd Iike to talk to you
about Nina Tremain.

359
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:53,919
She's not here.

360
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,553
FIN: Where is she?
I don't know.

361
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:57,326
Ask Children's Services.

362
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,799
They said that they
placed her with you.

363
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:02,200
You don't believe me?

364
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:04,034
Take a Iook.

365
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:05,971
That child was nothing
but trouble.

366
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,066
Hyperactive, no manners,

367
00:15:08,143 --> 00:15:09,303
always making a mess.

368
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:10,902
Well, when did they take her?

369
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:13,277
Must have been
over a month ago.

370
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,839
Then why did
Nina's case worker
tell us you had her?

371
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,045
Hell if I know.
That woman is Iazy.

372
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,712
Never makes a home visit.

373
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:21,517
Well, I find it hard
to believe Mrs. Preston

374
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,785
would forget to tell us
she took Nina.

375
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,053
She didn't take her.

376
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:28,392
It was some white guy
with dark hair.

377
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:29,987
Did you get his name?

378
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:31,327
I told you it was a month ago.

379
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,891
You expect me
to remember that?

380
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:36,868
BENSON: When was the Iast time
you saw Nina Tremain?

381
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,998
I'm gonna have to
check the file.

382
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:40,371
You got a memory problem?

383
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:41,601
I think it was Iast week.

384
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:42,769
Wrong answer.

385
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:44,539
It's possible
that I missed a visit.

386
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,581
Or more than one.

387
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:48,741
Even if I did,
it's hardly a police matter.

388
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:49,841
Wrong again.

389
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,146
Well, when you can't
make a visit,

390
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:52,777
you ever send
a colleague to cover?

391
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:55,118
A guy, maybe?
No, never.

392
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:56,421
No, then can you explain
why your records say

393
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:59,122
that you visited her
Iast Tuesday,

394
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:00,858
and Thelma Price says
you didn't.

395
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:03,162
That woman's a Iiar.
You're the Iiar, Iady!

396
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,099
Hey, I want my union rep.
BENSON: Yeah?

397
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,502
Well, why don't you tell
your union rep
that Nina Tremain is missing

398
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:11,235
and that you haven't seen her
in six weeks.

399
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,709
You were responsible
for this child's safety,

400
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:16,042
and you didn't even bother
to check on her.

401
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,604
This is not my fault.
Whose fault is it?

402
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:18,706
Do you know
what my job is Iike?

403
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:19,841
How big of a caseload I have?

404
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,215
There's no way
I can see every child.

405
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:23,277
If you're Iooking
for sympathy, you're barking
up the wrong tree.

406
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:24,754
Thelma Price was a good
foster mother.

407
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:26,848
I thought Nina
would be all right.

408
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:33,895
How could they Iet someone
just walk off with my child?

409
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:37,059
We don't know, but we're doing
everything we can to find him.

410
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:38,898
Now I need your help.

411
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,232
Anything.

412
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:43,672
Do you have something
with Nina's
fingerprints on it?

413
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,006
We draw together all the time.
I keep her pictures with me.

414
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:53,450
I guess it's Iike
having her here.

415
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:57,277
PIease be careful,
they're all I have.

416
00:16:57,355 --> 00:17:00,051
We'II take good care
of them, I promise.

417
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:05,622
Violet, is this
Nina's handprint?

418
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:06,755
Yeah.

419
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,396
We made that together
Iast Thanksgiving.

420
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:16,563
The mother
authenticates that it's
the child's handprint.

421
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:18,768
Will it work?
Let's see.

422
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:23,007
The anthropologist
sent the hand over,
it's finally ready to print.

423
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,580
Couldn't ask for better.

424
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,915
People did their jobs,
this wouldn't have happened.

425
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:30,215
Sorry guys,
prints don't match.

426
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:31,312
Are you sure?

427
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:32,913
Not even close.

428
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:38,789
So Nina's not the dead girl.

429
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:42,329
Nina Tremain
might still be alive.

430
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,698
Two Iittle girls,
Iook Iike sisters,
from the same neighborhood,

431
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:45,963
tell me that's a coincidence.

432
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:48,028
Same guy that killed Cherish
might have Nina.

433
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:50,006
Are we sure it's the same guy?

434
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:51,975
He's got dark hair
when he took Nina

435
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,238
and a blonde wig
when he killed Cherish.

436
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,610
Well, maybe he played dress-up
before he killed her.

437
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,979
Maybe it's not even
a blonde wig
we're Iooking for.

438
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,178
I gotta tell Violet
that Cherish Doe
isn't her daughter.

439
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:04,915
Cherish's real name
is Susie Marshall.

440
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:07,984
How'd you get that?

441
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,222
Computer kicked out a match
to a KidPrint card on file.

442
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:14,356
Grandmother had her printed
during Safety Week.

443
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:20,129
I always thought
this day would come,

444
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,571
but not to hear
my grandbaby is dead.

445
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,600
I thought it would be Ronnie.

446
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:26,735
Who?

447
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,302
My daughter. The junkie.

448
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,816
That's why you were
taking care of Susie?

449
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:41,019
Ronnie'd ask me
to baby-sit her for a night

450
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:43,356
and disappear for months.

451
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:47,262
Then she'd come home
clean and sober,

452
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:51,026
and beg me to give Susie back.

453
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,900
And this Iast time I agreed,

454
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:54,996
because I thought that Ronnie

455
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:58,099
had finally
straightened herself out.

456
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:01,376
When did you Iast see
your granddaughter?

457
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:04,574
About five or six months ago.

458
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:08,085
Weren't you worried
because it had been so Iong?

459
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:11,179
Honestly, I was relieved.

460
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:15,459
Ronnie came by and told me
that a man from Child Welfare

461
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,154
had taken her away.

462
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:25,095
A perfect stranger
shows up at your door,

463
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,330
says he's a social worker,

464
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:27,632
and you just
turn over your kid

465
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:28,763
without a second thought?

466
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,535
Predator profiles his victims,

467
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:32,235
the kids come from
a chaotic household,

468
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,743
he knows they're not
gonna question him.

469
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:36,075
Posing as a social worker
is the perfect cover.

470
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,614
Well, that's true for Nina,

471
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:41,049
but ACS has no record
of contacting Susie Marshall
or her mother.

472
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,586
There's gotta be
another connection.

473
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:44,645
Well, take your pick.

474
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:47,054
Our perv either knows the kids
or their mothers.

475
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,184
What do we know
about the fathers?

476
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,728
Well, we know
Nina's father is dead

477
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:54,424
and Susie's father
went back to Jamaica.

478
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,467
We got a rap sheet
on Ronnie Marshall yet?

479
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:59,469
String of arrests,
collared for shoplifting
three years ago.

480
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,529
Last known whereabouts,
strung out on the street.

481
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,541
Then we got to go back
to Violet.

482
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,167
Show her pictures
of Ronnie and Susie.

483
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:08,872
Maybe she can
connect the dots.

484
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:11,779
VIOLET:
I'd remember this girl.

485
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:15,148
She Iooks just Iike my Nina.
I'm sorry.

486
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,084
FIN: How about this woman?

487
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,025
That scar.
I've seen her before.
Where?

488
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:26,222
An NA meeting.
I remember thinking
someone cut up her face.

489
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:27,992
Which NA meetings
did you go to?

490
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:31,263
Five o'clock
at the Community Center,

491
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:34,897
St. Virgil's on Tuesdays,
a few others
when the urge hit.

492
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:36,907
Well, the whole point of NA

493
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:39,705
is total confidentiality,
it's first names only.

494
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:42,446
They're not gonna talk to us.

495
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:44,538
I bet they'd talk to you.

496
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,518
What do you mean?

497
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:50,782
Your story might convince
a 12-stepper to open up.

498
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:53,183
FIN: You in?

499
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:55,556
What's he doing?

500
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:58,221
I'd do anything
to get my baby back.

501
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:01,858
Whatever it takes
to find Nina.

502
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,525
I'II do anything
I can to help.

503
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:04,966
But I'm not
gonna put a civilian

504
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:07,163
in the middle
of a criminal investigation.

505
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:08,762
Whatever you're thinking,
don't.

506
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,205
Violet's our only way in.

507
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:12,709
Violet would be acting
as an agent of the police.

508
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:15,211
Any evidence she obtains
could be excluded in court.

509
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,713
We're not Iooking
for evidence, Counselor.

510
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,009
We're Iooking for a Iead.

511
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:19,709
Nina Tremain
might still be alive.

512
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:21,911
We're talking about
violating the confidentiality

513
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:23,476
of a drug treatment program.

514
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:26,114
AIex, I tell people in AA

515
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,021
things I wouldn't want
my best friend to know.

516
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:29,457
Now I'd be the first
to agree with you

517
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,859
but I don't see how making
an appeal could hurt.

518
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:35,797
I would prefer
to get the information
through Iegal channels.

519
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,868
I'II get a subpoena.
CRAGEN: For what?

520
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:40,369
NA doesn't keep
membership Iists or records.

521
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:42,269
You want to tell that woman
you care more about the Iaw

522
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,570
than the Iife of her child?

523
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:46,269
She's Iiving a parent's
worst nightmare.

524
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:49,370
You think I really
had to run a number on her?

525
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:51,509
AII right.

526
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:55,109
But the only way we do this
is the right way.

527
00:21:55,186 --> 00:21:56,312
Open meetings only.

528
00:21:56,387 --> 00:22:00,153
Disclose your presence
and don't Iet Violet
out of your sight.

529
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:06,229
The Ninth Step says,

530
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:07,286
we have to make amends

531
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:09,959
to those harmed
by our addiction.

532
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:13,662
Well I... I harmed my baby.

533
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:21,578
Because I got high,
I couldn't take care of Nina,

534
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,944
and some monster
kidnapped her.

535
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:28,181
I have to find
Ronnie Marshall.

536
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:29,378
I think
she's been here before,

537
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:31,115
and she might
have some information.

538
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:32,850
Ain't that against the rules?

539
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:36,985
The only way I can get
my Iittle girl back
is with your help.

540
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:38,926
I have to find Ronnie.

541
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,896
This is her picture.

542
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:48,127
The same freak
who stole my Nina
murdered her daughter.

543
00:22:50,508 --> 00:22:52,476
Time is running out.

544
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:55,774
If you know anything,
I am begging you to tell me.

545
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:59,541
Hey, what's the rush?
None of your business.

546
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:00,606
No, trust me,
it's my business.

547
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:01,709
I got nothing to say.

548
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:03,617
Then why are you running
Iike a Iittle scared rabbit?

549
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:05,315
I don't know nothing
about no missing kids.

550
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,880
But you do know
Ronnie Marshall.

551
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,118
I don't have to
tell you anything.

552
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,682
I respect
people's confidentiality.

553
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,092
How about respect
for the dead?

554
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:14,097
You think Ronnie
wants to attend her own
daughter's funeral?

555
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:15,894
This is for real?
It's not a scam?

556
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:18,094
You got my word.
I don't know, man,

557
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:19,397
people won't trust me
if I talk to a cop.

558
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,768
We never talked.

559
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,765
A place Ronnie and I
used to get high.

560
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,469
The Starlite Lounge.

561
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,335
Oh, yeah.
Ronnie used to come in.

562
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,472
Used to?

563
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:31,572
A while back.

564
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:33,947
Threw her out
for shooting up in the can.

565
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:36,486
Haven't seen her since.

566
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:38,488
Do you know
where we can find her?

567
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:40,751
I don't get personal
with the customers.

568
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:42,588
They pay, they drink,
they Ieave.

569
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,151
Any customers talk to Ronnie?

570
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:46,457
Only guys
who were drunk enough

571
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:48,294
to think
she Iooked good.

572
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:50,162
She'd go with a Ieper
for the price of a fix.

573
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:52,725
Any Iepers around here?

574
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,567
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

575
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:57,338
Hey, Pat!

576
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:00,068
You banged that
skanky chick once, right?
Ronnie?

577
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:01,338
The one with the scar?

578
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:04,210
Don't remind me.
This bitch boosted my wallet.

579
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:05,874
You go to her place?

580
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,783
Woman's shelter
don't allow guests.

581
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:10,445
We did it in a alley.

582
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,421
You know which shelter?

583
00:24:19,864 --> 00:24:22,628
FIN: You see Ronnie anywhere?
VIOLET: No.

584
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:26,964
Wait. There she is.
This is Ronnie.

585
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,967
Ronnie Marshall?

586
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:35,469
Leave me alone.
I have a couple more hours.

587
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:37,138
Wake up, Ronnie.

588
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:41,114
Who the hell are you?

589
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:44,210
I'm a cop.
I didn't do nothing.

590
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:49,723
Who's she?
I'm Violet.

591
00:24:51,162 --> 00:24:54,359
I'm Iooking for my daughter,
and I need your help.

592
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,790
Cost you twenty bucks,
I'II help you all you want.

593
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:00,201
We've got no time for games.

594
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:02,967
We think the same man
took your daughter.

595
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,905
No.

596
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:07,001
No. Social worker
took my baby.

597
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:10,070
That man
wasn't a social worker.

598
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:12,945
Oh, no? Who was he?

599
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:18,353
Look, I'm sorry,
but Susie's dead.

600
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:22,155
We found her body
two days ago.

601
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,357
She's better off.

602
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:32,794
That's how much you care
about your Iittle girl?

603
00:25:32,904 --> 00:25:36,340
Come on, get your ass up.
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,701
You Iook Iike crap, Ronnie.

605
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:41,438
When are you
gonna Iet me out of here?

606
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:44,037
Orange juice.
You're gonna need it.

607
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:47,308
What do you want from me?

608
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:49,979
Description of the man
who took Susie
for a sketch artist.

609
00:25:50,054 --> 00:25:52,249
I can't remember
back that far.
Can I go now, huh?

610
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:53,585
Look, I found your works.

611
00:25:53,658 --> 00:25:54,455
You don't cooperate,
I'm gonna bust you.

612
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:55,959
What is your problem?

613
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:58,792
Your daughter's dead
and there's not one cell
in your junkie body

614
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:00,957
that gives a damn.

615
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:03,831
That man who took
my daughter was right.

616
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:06,200
I'm not fit to be a mom.

617
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:08,762
Susie deserved more than me.

618
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:12,204
Now she's gone,
and there's nothing
that I can do

619
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:15,371
that's gonna change that.

620
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:18,780
You could help us save
this other Iittle girl.

621
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,818
Make it right for Susie.

622
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:26,817
We got to get
a description of this guy.

623
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:28,484
You can do this.

624
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,050
(CRYING)

625
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,534
Thelma, Ronnie worked this up
with a sketch artist.

626
00:26:36,602 --> 00:26:37,933
Does this Iook
Iike the man
who took Nina?

627
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:39,027
That's him.

628
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:41,402
There's got to be a connection
between this guy
and the three of you.

629
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:44,499
So both Ronnie and Violet
went to the same NA meeting.

630
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:45,770
Thelma, have you
ever been to one?

631
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:46,868
Never.

632
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:49,106
Maybe it wasn't the meetings,
but where they were held.

633
00:26:49,181 --> 00:26:50,842
Ronnie and I
both went to St. Virgil's.

634
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,042
FIN: You go
to that church, Thelma?

635
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:53,778
No, First Baptist.

636
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,820
How about Haven House?
Never been there.

637
00:26:55,887 --> 00:26:59,220
Ronnie, can you think
of anyplace else?
Anywhere at all?

638
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,553
Not really.

639
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:03,459
Come on, think.
Where did this guy see you?

640
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,123
Maybe at the Community Center
on Eighth Ave.

641
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:09,167
I stopped in there
a couple times.

642
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:12,863
I go there for Bingo Night.
Nina Iiked their playroom.

643
00:27:12,938 --> 00:27:14,200
Oh, God,

644
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,797
I went to meetings there.
I took Nina with me.

645
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,880
He cut his hair
and shaved his beard,

646
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:25,143
and he never wore glasses,

647
00:27:25,217 --> 00:27:26,946
but it could be Terry Jessup.

648
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,008
Who's that?

649
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:29,678
He worked here.
Quit a few months ago.

650
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:30,881
How Iong have you
known him?

651
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:33,823
Oh, most of his Iife.
He was a Iocal kid.

652
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,723
Just about grew up here.

653
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:39,059
Had a mother who was unstable.
Went on and off her meds.

654
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:40,462
ACS ever remove him?

655
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:42,022
Well, we called them
several times,

656
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,263
once when he had
a terrible burn
on his hand.

657
00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:47,328
But, you know,
he told them
it was an accident.

658
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:48,600
What did Terry do here?

659
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:52,508
CIeaned up, you know,
took out the trash,
small repairs.

660
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:54,238
He used to fix
the broken toys.

661
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:56,212
That was his real passion.

662
00:27:56,314 --> 00:27:59,078
So he was around
the kids?

663
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:01,585
He had quite
a doll collection.

664
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:03,018
He Ioved showing it to them.

665
00:28:03,555 --> 00:28:06,456
Strange hobby
for an adult man,
collecting dolls.

666
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:08,186
He inherited them
from his mother.

667
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,524
Terry called them his Iegacy.

668
00:28:10,595 --> 00:28:12,028
We're gonna need
to talk to Terry.

669
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:13,462
Do you have
an address for him?

670
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:17,263
I can't imagine
that Terry's in trouble
with the police.

671
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:19,735
Do you recognize
this Iittle girl?

672
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:22,797
That's Cherish Doe,
from the news?

673
00:28:22,874 --> 00:28:25,240
Her real name
is Susie Marshall

674
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,743
and the other one
is Nina Tremain.

675
00:28:26,812 --> 00:28:28,143
Oh, my God.

676
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:31,377
You do recognize them.

677
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,747
Just to say hi.

678
00:28:33,452 --> 00:28:34,817
I can't believe it.

679
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:36,945
Did you ever see Terry
around either one of them?

680
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:38,182
No.

681
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:40,121
But he did pay
special attention

682
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:42,922
to the kids
with tough home Iives.

683
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:45,519
He said that they
needed extra Iove.

684
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:50,898
Damn it! We're too Iate.

685
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:54,663
Here we go.

686
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,935
The paper's
three months old.

687
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:59,670
Jessup must have taken off
after he kidnapped Susie.

688
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:01,940
He's got to have another place
where he stashed Susie's body

689
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:04,914
before he dumped her.

690
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:06,644
Got something over here.

691
00:29:06,718 --> 00:29:09,482
Polaroid?

692
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:10,646
Susie Marshall.

693
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:13,020
Yeah, dressed up
Iike a Iittle doll.

694
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:21,461
Dolls are idealized
representations
of men and women.

695
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:23,865
They're pure,
perfect and sexless.

696
00:29:23,935 --> 00:29:25,232
Terry Jessup
is Iike a child

697
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:27,203
who uses dolls
to act out his fantasies.

698
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:29,467
But he's a grown man
and his fantasies are sexual.

699
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,634
And he feels guilty
about being attracted
to children

700
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,541
and so he turns them
into dolls.

701
00:29:33,612 --> 00:29:34,704
Which works for a while...

702
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,340
Until he gives in,
he has sex with the doll,

703
00:29:37,415 --> 00:29:39,815
but then it's not
a doll anymore,
so he kills it.

704
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:41,045
Why stash the body?

705
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,711
Again, out of guilt.

706
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:44,278
And then when he finds
a new playmate,

707
00:29:44,356 --> 00:29:45,914
he just discards the Iast one.

708
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:47,117
STABLER: Talked to your friend
at Bellevue,

709
00:29:47,192 --> 00:29:49,387
got me the psych records
on Jessup's mother.

710
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:50,758
Diagnosed with
severe depression

711
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,694
with intermittent
bouts of mania.

712
00:29:52,764 --> 00:29:54,595
She'd go around having
sex with dozens of men

713
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:58,568
and then go on
these spending sprees
buying nothing but dolls.

714
00:29:58,637 --> 00:29:59,763
Give you anything on Jessup?

715
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:00,964
Well, the shrink said
that she was

716
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,564
intermittently abusive
and seductive towards him.

717
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:06,008
Perfect way
to raise a serial killer.

718
00:30:06,077 --> 00:30:08,011
I talked to a couple
of Jessup's neighbors.

719
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,740
The stress of his mother's
death a year ago

720
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:11,214
pushed him over the edge.

721
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:13,148
He became reclusive
and explosive.

722
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:15,311
I just got off with CSU.

723
00:30:15,387 --> 00:30:18,823
No forensic evidence
either Nina or Susie
were in Jessup's apartment.

724
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,982
Well, to keep
the girls prisoner,

725
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:22,322
Jessup would have
needed privacy and isolation.

726
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:23,952
STABLER: He snatched
both girls in the 'hood,

727
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,826
dumped Susie back there.

728
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:29,424
If he's following a pattern,
Nina's got to be nearby.

729
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:31,162
TREVOR: Check this out.

730
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:32,863
Moving in?

731
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:36,169
My own doll collection.

732
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:38,607
Fibers came from
a Madame Charlotte doll.

733
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:39,701
Very exclusive.

734
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:42,076
CRAGEN: Well, how exclusive
is their distribution?

735
00:30:42,147 --> 00:30:44,115
Only three stores in the city.

736
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:49,118
Sure, I've known
Terry Jessup for years.

737
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:50,586
Not a Iot of guys
are into collecting,

738
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:51,644
but his money's good.

739
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:52,849
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

740
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:52,516
Oh, it's a couple
of months ago.

741
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:55,221
He came in to buy
the new Princess AIexis.

742
00:30:55,295 --> 00:30:57,923
Craftsmanship,
that's what Terry cares about.

743
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:00,296
Only perfect dolls
in mint condition.

744
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:01,891
We need an address for him.

745
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:03,527
I send mailings
to preferred customers

746
00:31:03,604 --> 00:31:06,004
whenever a new
Madame Charlotte comes out.

747
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,201
Here we go.
2555 Eighth Avenue.

748
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:11,141
That's his old apartment.

749
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,542
Avid collector Iike Terry

750
00:31:12,613 --> 00:31:14,513
surely sent you
a change of address.

751
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,639
No.

752
00:31:16,183 --> 00:31:18,481
But he called
a couple of weeks ago.

753
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:20,213
Pre-ordered a Virginia Belle.

754
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:22,482
Left a number for me to call
when it came in.

755
00:31:22,556 --> 00:31:25,684
917 area. Cell phone.

756
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,660
Call Terry and tell him
his order came in.

757
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:45,602
Terry, I'm sorry.
(SOFTLY) He just came in.

758
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,137
What's wrong?
After I called you,
I opened the box.

759
00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:50,911
The shipment was damaged.

760
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:53,077
Would you take
a Princess Renee instead?

761
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:54,415
You know
I don't collect Renees.

762
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:56,251
The workmanship's shoddy.

763
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:59,850
How about
a 50th anniversary Nicolette,
Iimited edition?

764
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:08,966
Okay, but I still want
the Virginia Belle.

765
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:11,266
Promise. I'II call you.
Okay.

766
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:20,206
He's on the move.

767
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:44,165
STABLER: Police!
Let's see your hands.

768
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:45,932
Don't hurt me.
Don't move.

769
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,405
Where is she, Terry?
What?

770
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:49,942
On your knees.
Nina Tremain,
where is she?

771
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,307
Nina?
Tell us where Nina is,

772
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:53,005
before I take
your punk ass head off.

773
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,342
I don't know.
STABLER: Hey, Terry.

774
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:55,711
Terry!
Where's the top sheet?

775
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:58,046
Did you use this to wrap up
Susie Marshall's body?

776
00:32:58,118 --> 00:32:59,847
Terry!

777
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,547
PIease don't hurt my dolls.

778
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:05,086
PIease don't.
Tell us where Nina is.

779
00:33:05,158 --> 00:33:07,353
She's not here!

780
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:08,985
Get his ass up.

781
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,194
We ran Iine-ups.

782
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:16,929
We got positive IDs
from Thelma Price and Ronnie.

783
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:18,028
Nice job.

784
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:19,970
I don't need a confession
to win this case.

785
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,440
But we do need one
to find Nina Tremain.

786
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:24,306
Any chance
she's still alive?

787
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,608
Warner couldn't pin down
the exact time
of death for Susie.

788
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,079
AII we know is that
he kept her breathing

789
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:29,581
between two and four weeks.

790
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:31,708
And we're at
the four-week mark
with Nina right now.

791
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:33,275
If he killed her,
he'd be agitated.

792
00:33:33,353 --> 00:33:34,820
He'd be on the prowl
for his next victim,

793
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:38,346
instead, he's in there
sleeping Iike a baby.

794
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:40,120
You know what?
Why don't you all
take a Iittle walk

795
00:33:40,193 --> 00:33:41,660
while Terry and I
get better acquainted.

796
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,662
Now, he's not going
to respond to threats.

797
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,826
He's very Ionely.
Dolls and children
are his only companions.

798
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,562
He needs a friend.

799
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,262
Your dolls are beautiful.

800
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:53,898
I had Iots of dolls,

801
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:57,068
but never ones
as nice as yours.

802
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:00,340
Girls are Iucky.

803
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,747
They can play with dolls.
Boys aren't supposed to.

804
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:05,250
I had dolls.

805
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:07,410
You did? What kind?

806
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:08,818
You know,
GI Joe, Batman...

807
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,756
Those are action figures.

808
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,890
Terry, I hear that your mother
started your doll collection.

809
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:18,988
She Iiked beautiful things.

810
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,931
I inherited them
when she died.

811
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:22,468
And you Iove them very much.

812
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,697
They were her most
precious possession.

813
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,171
Now they're mine.
She can't take them
away from me.

814
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,572
BENSON: Your mother
didn't want you
to have the dolls?

815
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:31,042
She'd hit me
if I touched them.

816
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,477
She said that I'd break them.

817
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:36,641
"Boys are too rough.
Boys can't be trusted

818
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:38,343
"to handle fragile things."

819
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:42,551
But sometimes,
when she was really happy,

820
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:45,416
she'd Iet me dress them up.

821
00:34:46,193 --> 00:34:48,787
I was very careful
not to break them.

822
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,229
I bet you take
really good care
of those dolls.

823
00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:57,200
And I hear
that you fix them, too.

824
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,135
Yeah, I can fix anything.

825
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:01,731
I'm really good with my hands.

826
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,038
Man, that burn
must have hurt.

827
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:08,347
It was an accident.
BENSON:
Did your mother do that?

828
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:09,882
She Ioved me.

829
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:16,153
But Iittle boys are wicked.
Little boys need discipline.

830
00:35:16,223 --> 00:35:19,021
But your mother
had no right to hurt you.

831
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,692
Little children deserve
to be Ioved.

832
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:26,425
Bad mothers shouldn't bring
Iittle children
into this world.

833
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,990
Susie Marshall
have a bad mother?

834
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:30,127
She was a crack whore.

835
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:33,072
Susie was sad all the time.

836
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,630
I Iet her play with my dolls.

837
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:36,005
Is that why
you took her, Terry?

838
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:38,101
So she could play with you?

839
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,873
In the Center,
she Ioved my dolls,

840
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:41,413
but then she didn't want
to play anymore.

841
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:42,778
She just wanted to go home.

842
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,249
And that must've
made you mad.

843
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:48,118
She broke one of my dolls.

844
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,679
I told her not to,
I told her that she'd be sorry

845
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:49,746
but she wouldn't Iisten.

846
00:35:49,825 --> 00:35:52,157
That's when Susie got hurt?

847
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:56,126
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

848
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:57,688
Where did you keep Susie?

849
00:35:57,766 --> 00:35:59,097
I can't tell you.

850
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:00,965
BENSON: Okay, Terry. Okay.

851
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:05,372
Well, then
Iet's talk about Nina.

852
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:08,500
No.

853
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:11,679
Terry, Nina has
a good mother.

854
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:13,305
No, she doesn't.

855
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:16,613
I saw her Ieave Nina
with that evil woman.

856
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:18,346
I saw that woman
yelling at Nina.

857
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,820
Terry, Nina's mother
came back.

858
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,815
She misses her
and wants to see her again.

859
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,917
I know what
you're trying to do.

860
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:27,154
You're trying to trick me.

861
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:30,164
Terry, where is Nina?
Where is Nina?

862
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:33,834
Where is she?

863
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:40,602
He's completely dissociated.
Just give him some time.

864
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:42,735
We don't have any time.
It's too Iate.

865
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,142
VIOLET: Detective Tutuola.

866
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:46,511
Violet, what are you
doing here?

867
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:50,780
Fin called me. He told me
that you have the man
who took Nina.

868
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:52,376
We have a suspect in custody.

869
00:36:52,454 --> 00:36:53,751
Who won't talk.

870
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:55,619
I've got to see him.

871
00:36:56,158 --> 00:36:57,785
Give us a minute.

872
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:01,359
I thought we were working
this case together

873
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,057
and you called Violet
without telling me?

874
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:04,826
You got another way
to get Jessup to talk?

875
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,562
Putting Violet and Jessup
together is a bad idea.

876
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:09,763
She was strong enough
to go to those NA meetings.

877
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:11,863
We prep her correctly,
I know she can handle it.

878
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,840
Back me up, Doc.

879
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:16,377
Jessup thinks he's saving Nina
from an abusive parent.

880
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,572
If you challenge his delusion,
he might break.

881
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:19,807
And if this doesn't work,

882
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:21,940
the guilt
will destroy Violet's Iife.

883
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:24,952
A dead child's gonna
destroy her even more.

884
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,853
Nina's gonna die
if we don't do something.

885
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:42,594
You sure you can do this?

886
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:45,865
Yes.

887
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:50,136
No matter what he says,
you have to be
stronger than him.

888
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:01,886
I'm ready.

889
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,449
Hello, Terry.

890
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:17,802
Do you know who I am?

891
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:23,942
Nina's mom?

892
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,970
That's right.

893
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,345
My name is Violet.

894
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:36,424
You ran away.

895
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:38,322
Nina was so sad.

896
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:42,258
I was sad, too.

897
00:38:42,331 --> 00:38:44,265
I missed her very much.

898
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,261
But I Ieft to help Nina.

899
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,862
I was no good to her
the way I was.

900
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:59,280
That's why
Violet came back, Terry.

901
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:01,282
She came back for Nina.

902
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:07,582
It's too Iate.

903
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:10,022
FIN: No, it's not.

904
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:13,653
Nina needs her mother.
Make it right.

905
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,130
Nina's a good girl.

906
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:22,769
Yes, she is.

907
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:27,569
I'm a good mother.

908
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:33,508
Do you Iove her?
Yes.

909
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:40,244
With her gone,
it's Iike a knife in my heart.

910
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,477
I have another place.

911
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:26,763
Bastard's playing us.

912
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:31,704
Maybe not. Trap door. EIIiot.

913
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:42,075
Nina?

914
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,448
It's okay, baby.

915
00:40:54,396 --> 00:40:57,024
It's okay, baby.
I'm a police officer.

916
00:40:57,699 --> 00:40:59,030
(GROANING)

917
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,592
I got you. It's okay, baby.
You okay, baby? Look at me.

918
00:41:03,138 --> 00:41:07,734
Look at me, baby, Iook. Okay.
I'II get you out of here.

919
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:09,939
I miss my Mommy.

920
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,273
I'II take you home.

921
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,278
She'II be all right.

922
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,846
Mommy?

923
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:31,864
Thank you.
