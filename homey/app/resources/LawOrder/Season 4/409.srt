1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:04,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:06,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:08,872
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:12,607
are members
of an elite squad known as
the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:14,649
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:20,219
Yeah. Okay, thanks.
Come on.

8
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:23,457
Go, go, go!

9
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:40,063
Police! NYPD!
We have a search warrant!

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,534
What the hell?

11
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,611
Somebody got here
before us.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,308
Secure it.
I don't want
any surprises.

13
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:50,313
OFFICER 1: Too Iate.

14
00:00:58,293 --> 00:01:00,124
I better call in SVU.

15
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:02,929
We are not handing
this bust over to them.

16
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,591
Don't worry.
I got a buddy.

17
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,729
FIN: Better be good.

18
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:10,829
Anonymous phone tip
said somebody was dealing.

19
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:14,398
We surveilled a week,
caught a Iot of traffic
in and out of this place.

20
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:19,846
Get our warrant, bust in,
find our alleged
dealer sliced and diced.

21
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:23,407
Signs of burglary, and by her
appearance I'm guessing she's
been raped, too.

22
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:27,888
But, you know, I wanted
a trained SVU detective
Iike yourself on the case.

23
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:30,481
Rape-homicide falls
on SVU no matter what.

24
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:33,084
You didn't have to
hand it to me personally.

25
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,994
There's a big haul here.
Looks good for my guys
to turn it in.

26
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:39,465
Yeah, right.
You get all the glory
and we get all the work.

27
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:43,937
So you trying to tell me
that Laura Ashley here
is some kind of big kingpin?

28
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,472
Where are the drugs?

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,098
You didn't get
the complete tour.

30
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:00,011
Over two hundred plants.

31
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:02,386
Pull in a couple
of hundred thou
on the street.

32
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,260
Perp missed the jackpot.

33
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:58,838
M.E. estimates TOD
yesterday between
9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.

34
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:01,439
Looked Iike about
30 to 40 stab wounds.

35
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:02,778
Overkill.

36
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:06,284
He either knew her
well enough to hate her
or he's psychotic.

37
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,117
Point of entry Iooks Iike
the fire escape window.

38
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,055
Perp probably waltzed
out the front door.

39
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,559
Got minimal fluids
from the rape kit,
but enough to test.

40
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,753
You Iocate a
murder weapon?

41
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:14,886
Must've taken
it with him.

42
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:16,931
Three-inch, single-edged,
non-serrated blade.

43
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:19,125
About the size of the knife
missing from this?

44
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:21,396
Yeah. The other
weapon he Ieft behind.

45
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:25,165
Bashed in the back of her
head before he stabbed her.

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,868
Probably enough
to knock her out.
No defensive wounds.

47
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:30,309
It's not the most
obvious weapon.

48
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,278
So she surprises him.

49
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,079
Probably picked up
the first thing
he could grab.

50
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,449
Then he walks all the way
across the apartment
for a knife?

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,953
This guy's Iogic is
all over the place.

52
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,046
Maybe he's mentally ill.
Or high.

53
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,785
LAYTON: He covered
Mrs. Oestreicher with this.

54
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:49,159
By the amount of blood on
the blanket, I'd say right
after he stabbed her.

55
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:53,258
So afterwards
he gets remorseful,
embarrassed?

56
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:54,825
And then sick.

57
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,532
Our guy must
have thrown up.

58
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:01,636
It's too far away
to be the victim's.

59
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,972
Okay, Iet's send
a sample to the M.E.

60
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,808
We can compare it to
the stomach contents of our
victim, just to be sure.

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,938
LAYTON: I Iove my job.

62
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,482
What do we know about
this anonymous phone tip?

63
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,040
Narcotics traced
it to a neighbor.

64
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:12,382
Said she's nosy,
but not homicidal.

65
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,854
I thought anonymous
tip meant anonymous.

66
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:17,084
Like nobody would
bug you about doing
your civic duty.

67
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,625
We certainly don't mean
to inconvenience you.

68
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:21,355
But there was a woman
murdered in your building.

69
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,987
I know. I'm sorry
about that.

70
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,692
But you Iive
that kind of Iife,
you're asking for it.

71
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,359
And what kind
of Iife is that?

72
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,427
Criminal. You should've
been here when she was
sparking up.

73
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:31,802
Just walking down
the hall you'd get a buzz.

74
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,898
Marc, get in there
and brush those teeth now.

75
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:35,670
So you reported
Mrs. Oestreicher

76
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:39,510
as a drug dealer
because you smelled dope.
That was the only reason?

77
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,879
What about the daily
Easter parade?

78
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,182
In and out of there,
people banging on the door
all hours of the day.

79
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:50,088
Did you ever actually
see any of these deals,
any money changing hands?

80
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:54,026
No. No, but if she wasn't
selling, I don't know where
she got her money.

81
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,620
She hasn't worked
a day in over a year.

82
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:58,097
Autopsy's done.

83
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,794
So are the preliminary
Iabs on the fluids from
the rape kit.

84
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:02,302
Anything interesting?

85
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,735
Your perp had no sperm.

86
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,796
Interesting and pathetic.

87
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:09,537
I'm not talking
Iow sperm count.
This is azoospermia.

88
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:12,876
Zero sperm in the ejaculate.
It's pretty rare.

89
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,744
So our guy
got a vasectomy.

90
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,579
That's one
explanation for it.

91
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:20,451
It's also a sign of
Kartagener's Syndrome
and Cystic Fibrosis.

92
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:23,787
The Iab can still extract
DNA from the skin
cells in the sample.

93
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,382
And they're
analyzing the vomit.

94
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,927
We know who puked?

95
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:30,522
Victim hadn't eaten
in hours, so it had to
come from your perp.

96
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,532
As far as Miss Oestreicher
is concerned,

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,626
I suspect she would have died
within the year, had she not
been murdered.

98
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:36,932
What was
wrong with her?

99
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,905
Advanced
ovarian cancer.

100
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:41,806
She has small radiation burns
on the skin of her abdomen,

101
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,436
and blood tests reveal
Taxol and carboplatin.

102
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,070
She was undergoing
chemotherapy.

103
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:48,047
That explains why
she didn't have a job.

104
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,084
And why she was
growing pot.

105
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,211
Must have been using it
to counteract the side effects
of the cancer treatment.

106
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:55,654
Decent Ievels of
THC in her system.

107
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:57,521
But that woman was growing
a forest in there.

108
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,560
You think she was
toking on all that
by herself?

109
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:00,651
Maybe she wasn't.

110
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:03,254
You know, medicinal
marijuana clubs are
popping up everywhere.

111
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:06,698
People are pooling their
resources, growing their
own stuff.

112
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,929
Better product without
having to pay street prices.

113
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:11,938
Well, if she's running a club,
then there has to be
a membership Iist.

114
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,801
How many people
we Iooking at?

115
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,574
According to her
day planner,
nearly 100.

116
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,047
But there's no names.
She only writes initials.

117
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:25,177
We got C.K. down
the second Monday
of every month.

118
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,016
J.A.S. every
other Saturday.

119
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,648
Probably a schedule.
Members take turns
tending the crop.

120
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,282
Why the hell you
know so much about it?

121
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:34,522
Twenty-five years on the job
and he's still a damn hippie.

122
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:38,259
Okay, I got the phone dumps
from Susan Oestreicher
for the past six months.

123
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,029
We got to match the names
with the initials and weed
out the potheads.

124
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,263
Find one club member,
might Iead us to the rest.

125
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:46,034
Convincing somebody
to turn over that Iist
is not going to be easy.

126
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:49,770
People Iooking at
a narcotics rap tend
to be real cooperative.

127
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,142
Threatening cancer patients.
Now, that's why
I became a cop.

128
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,046
They're breaking the Iaw.
I don't care how sick
they are.

129
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:58,517
Do you have any idea
why cannabis is
illegal in this country?

130
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,486
Because William Randolph
Hearst's paper mills

131
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:01,954
were threatened by
the hemp industry.

132
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,389
And that's got nothing
to do with the fact that
it's a drug.

133
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,949
What do you call
alcohol and tobacco?

134
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:07,460
Legal.

135
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,791
Here we go.

136
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,195
For the initials C.K.,
we've got a Cindy Kerber.

137
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:16,795
C.K. C.K. Charles Kelsey,
Christian Kessler.
This is going to be fun.

138
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:17,997
We'II run them all down.

139
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,939
If they had access
to the victim,
they're all suspects.

140
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:26,437
STABLER: We know about
your club, Miss Kerber.

141
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,505
Then I assume you found
what we were growing.

142
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,778
Pretty tough to miss.
You guys have
very green thumbs.

143
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:33,252
We're not hurting
anyone and we're
not making a profit.

144
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:35,221
We are investigating
a murder.

145
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,157
Now, all we need
are the other names
of the members in the club.

146
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,023
The rest is between us.

147
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,562
I don't know most of
the people involved.
We don't socialize.

148
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,291
Give us the names
of the people
you do know.

149
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,094
I'm sorry. I can't.

150
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,794
This woman
was raped.

151
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,427
She was stabbed
38 times.

152
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:53,031
You don't want to help us
in our investigation?
That is very strange to me.

153
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,098
Because it wasn't
anyone in the club.

154
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:59,078
Some of these people were
debilitated from nausea,
from chemotherapy.

155
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:03,846
The only thing that controls
my tremors from M.S.
is smoking once in a while.

156
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,943
Why would we kill the woman
who was helping us?

157
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,750
Maybe she was
helping the wrong person.

158
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,883
Somebody's sick,
doesn't make
them an angel.

159
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,693
There was some trouble
with this one woman, Becky.
Not her, really. Her husband.

160
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,698
What kind of trouble?

161
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:23,328
He threatened Sue.
Said she hooked
his wife on drugs.

162
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:25,872
Becky was dying
from metastatic
breast cancer,

163
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,340
and he wouldn't allow her
the tiniest bit of relief.

164
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,377
Well, do you think
that he's capable
of murder?

165
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,106
I know his own wife
was afraid of him.

166
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,776
Especially after he broke
some guy's back in a bar
fight. Went to jail for it.

167
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,284
I wouldn't
touch that bitch.

168
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:41,914
Isn't it refreshing to hear
such militant adherence to
the "Just Say No" philosophy?

169
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,014
It's so rare
in convicts.

170
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,786
That incident
was an accident.

171
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:48,420
I did five years inside,
and now my wife's dead.

172
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:50,760
I paid the price.
Go bother somebody else.

173
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:52,265
No, we're bothering you,
Mr. Paglione.

174
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,063
You got an awful Iot of hate
for the woman who was trying
to comfort your wife.

175
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:56,865
Yeah, that's a real
beautiful story.

176
00:08:56,938 --> 00:09:00,897
Until one of you comes to my
house and finds drugs and
busts me for parole violation.

177
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,776
I was working from
6:00 in the morning
to 4:00, and no Iunch break.

178
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:09,674
And that's all I'm saying.

179
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:16,787
BENSON: We'II see you
back at the house.

180
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,716
Munch says the husband's
alibi checks out.

181
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:21,318
This membership Iist
is getting smaller.

182
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,660
Half these people
are either dead or too
weak to get out of bed.

183
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,325
Maybe we're going
down the wrong path
with this pot club.

184
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:31,602
No, I just can't buy that
the murder and the drugs
are a coincidence.

185
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,540
Susan Oestreicher's neighbor
thought she was a drug dealer.

186
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,440
What if somebody
else thought so, too?

187
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,011
An M.E. out of the morgue?
Must be big.

188
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,912
Captain Cragen told me
you were here.

189
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:44,975
Lab finished analyzing
the vomit from
the crime scene.

190
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:47,681
Hey, am I gonna
want to stop eating
before I hear this?

191
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:52,419
Pieces of roast beef,
a Iittle mozzarella cheese,
kernels of corn and raisins.

192
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:54,461
Luckily, they hadn't been
in the stomach very Iong,

193
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,326
so everything was
only partially digested.

194
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,160
Yeah, I'm done.

195
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:00,598
And this is
good news because?

196
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,568
My daughter's in
the sixth grade.

197
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:06,664
She had that exact
meal for Iunch at school
on the day of the murder.

198
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:10,199
I've got the menu
on the fridge.
I called the Board of Ed.

199
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,736
Every middle school
in Manhattan serves
the same Iunch.

200
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,007
No sperm in the ejaculate.

201
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:21,455
We're Iooking for a kid.

202
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,649
Are we buying in to
this juvenile theory?

203
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:27,194
Well, it makes sense.

204
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:30,628
The disorganization of
the crime scene indicates
an immature thought process.

205
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:33,895
The number of stab wounds
could mean he has no real
understanding of physiology.

206
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,528
He just kills
the way he thinks that
you're supposed to kill.

207
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:38,731
The rape. Sexual curiosity.

208
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,331
Well, we know the kid went
to school that day Iong
enough to have Iunch,

209
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,240
so he must've
cut out afterwards.

210
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:46,109
Well, we're not canvassing
every junior high in the city,

211
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,549
and I'm not waiting for a DNA
analysis of the puke,
so Iet's hear suggestions.

212
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:54,281
Okay, we're Iooking for
a boy who has a history
of fights in school.

213
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:56,983
Minor vandalism with
risk-taking behavior.

214
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:58,491
Sounds Iike every
teenage boy on the planet.

215
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,925
I know.
It's not much
to go on.

216
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:03,520
But adolescent behavior
is inherently unpredictable.

217
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:05,566
That's why mental
health care professionals

218
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:08,830
won't Iabel a child
a sociopath even if
he fits the definition.

219
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,565
So the profile's wide open.
What else?

220
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,163
Juvies stay
with the familiar.

221
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:15,232
Maybe the victim
knew this kid.

222
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,004
And even if she didn't,
he's Iikely to commit

223
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:18,807
the crimes in his
own comfort zone.

224
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,939
The neighbor
who phoned in
the tip to Narcotics.

225
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,505
Her son Iooked
about 13, right?

226
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:28,021
That was Mrs. Lesinski
and her son Marc.

227
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,955
Maybe he Iistens to Mom
rail about the drug
dealer down the hall,

228
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,687
he figures he can get
himself some free dope.

229
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,787
And get some cash
for a new Xbox
while he's at it.

230
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,354
Check him out.

231
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,530
Look, I told you,
Marc didn't see who
killed her.

232
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,035
He was in school.

233
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:44,230
You're sure about that?

234
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:45,363
Of course I am.

235
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,738
And the school calls
if he skips class?

236
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,174
What exactly
are you asking?

237
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,677
Mrs. Lesinski,
we need to speak
with Marc right now.

238
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:53,008
You think he could
have done this?

239
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,015
He is a child.
Are you crazy?

240
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:59,241
Has Marc bought anything
that he doesn't have
the money for?

241
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,309
No.

242
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,447
Have you seen him with...

243
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,923
Seen him with anything
expensive that you
didn't give him?

244
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,757
He said it was
a present from
a friend.

245
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,559
STABLER: Come on over here.
Show it to us, will you?

246
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:16,793
An MP3 player.

247
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,131
Must be a very good friend
to be so generous.

248
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,700
No, the kid's a total geek.
He's always giving stuff
to people.

249
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:25,575
Oh. This total geek
have a name?

250
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,409
Jeremy Brice.

251
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:29,074
STABLER: Mmm-hmm. Where do
you think Jeremy got that?

252
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:33,619
Did you tell him that you
had a drug dealer Iiving
down the hall from you?

253
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:34,814
Yeah.
What'd you say?

254
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:39,887
I said that she's probably
got some pretty cool stuff,
you know, 'cause she deals.

255
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:43,624
BENSON: So don't you think
it's possible that he got it
from Mrs. Oestreicher's place?

256
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:45,290
I don't know, maybe.

257
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,266
But there's no way
Jeremy killed her.

258
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:50,165
Well, how do you
know that?

259
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:51,899
He's just not that cool.

260
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,201
(DOOR BELL RINGING)

261
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,573
It is almost 8:00.
Everybody's already Ieft.

262
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:58,669
Let's pull him
out of school.

263
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:03,177
Liv. Liv.
Kids waiting
for the bus.

264
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,856
Hi, guys.
Anyone know
Jeremy Brice?

265
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:12,051
Who?

266
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,150
Jeremy Brice.

267
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,285
There.

268
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,730
You Jeremy?

269
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,665
Relax, relax,
relax, Jeremy.

270
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:21,861
I didn't do anything!

271
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:24,131
We're the police.
We want to talk to you.
Just relax.

272
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:27,663
Jeremy, that Iooks
Iike blood.

273
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:29,972
No, it isn't.

274
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,569
We're going down to
the police station,
Jeremy, all right?

275
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:33,773
Where are
your parents?

276
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,713
I have to go to school.
I have to...

277
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,616
You made a mistake.
Jeremy was in school all day.

278
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:42,815
We checked, Mrs. Brice.

279
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,018
Jeremy's teachers told
us that he was absent
after Iunch.

280
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,458
You skipped school?

281
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,756
No.

282
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,129
Jeremy? Jeremy,
Iook at me a second.

283
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:55,496
You know you're
not supposed to Iie
to the police, right?

284
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,628
I'm not Iying.

285
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:59,468
STABLER: Where'd you get
the MP3 player you gave
to your buddy Marc?

286
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,409
I gave him that
for his birthday.

287
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,648
Do you know a Iady named
Susan Oestreicher?

288
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:10,809
No.

289
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:14,377
You sure? She's the woman that
Iives right next door to Marc.

290
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,855
Jeremy, you went
into that apartment,

291
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,085
and something bad
happened there,
didn't it?

292
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,923
I didn't go anywhere.

293
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:24,954
Jeremy, these are your
fingerprints that your mom
Iet us take when you got here.

294
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,358
Remember that?

295
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:34,363
These are the ones
that we found in
Miss Oestreicher's apartment.

296
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,141
They're exactly the same.

297
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,509
No, they're not.

298
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,380
STABLER: They are.
This tells me you
were in that apartment.

299
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,816
No, it doesn't.

300
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:47,252
Jeremy, what happened?

301
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,950
Nothing. Why is
everybody picking on me?

302
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,819
We'II take another crack
at him once he calms down.

303
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:57,558
Well, we know he
was in the apartment.

304
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:00,760
Once the Iabs come back on
the forensic evidence,
we won't need a confession.

305
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:01,927
A typical kid.

306
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,301
Thinks if he denies
everything,
it'II just go away.

307
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:07,535
He's 14. EIigible to
be tried as an adult.

308
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,805
Murder two.
Would've been
eligible if he was 13.

309
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,368
He Iook Iike
a grownup to you?

310
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:15,415
He brutally
raped and murdered
a 34-year-old woman.

311
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:16,507
That's a grownup crime.

312
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:19,280
He's not crying
for his victim,
he's crying for himself.

313
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,344
Guess you can't blame him.
His Iife is over.

314
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:25,791
Labs are back.
BIood on Jeremy's coat
matched the victim's type.

315
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,418
Sounds Iike your
job is done.

316
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:28,723
No. We're not that Iucky.

317
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,594
Lab's determined
that the rapist's
blood was a type B.

318
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,759
I got Jeremy's from
his school. He's type O.

319
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,597
He had a partner.
Yeah.

320
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,570
No sperm, so it's
got to be another kid.

321
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,572
Well, what about
that neighbor's boy?

322
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,164
Well, I checked him.
He didn't skip school

323
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:43,506
and went to basketball
practice afterwards.

324
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:47,411
Can we hold off on charging
Jeremy as an adult till we
get the story straight?

325
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:50,416
Well, he's 14,
so he's automatically
arraigned in Supreme Court.

326
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:52,384
But if you can prove to me
he wasn't the primary actor,

327
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,478
I will recommend he be
removed to Family Court.

328
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,250
Find out who
his friends are.

329
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:02,329
We're no strangers
to police inquiring
about some of our students,

330
00:16:02,397 --> 00:16:05,161
but I am surprised to hear
you're investigating
Mr. Brice.

331
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,064
Jeremy's not a
troublemaker?

332
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,069
I don't know him,
so I guess not.

333
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,037
1,500 students, Detectives.

334
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:12,733
I only got time
for the bad eggs.

335
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:15,174
You're saying he's
a model student, then.

336
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:19,680
Academically, yes.
He does very well.
Especially in math and art.

337
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:24,412
But he was recently
diagnosed as dyslexic,
and according to his file,

338
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:28,252
his fifth grade teacher cited
social problems made him
repeat the year.

339
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,052
What kind of
social problems?

340
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,650
Well, I spoke with
Jeremy's teachers
this morning,

341
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:35,162
and he's a Iittle
behind maturity-wise.

342
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,061
He has some
trouble fitting in.

343
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:40,067
But again, nothing
to suggest any serious
discipline problems.

344
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:42,660
Teachers give you the names
of Jeremy's friends?

345
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:44,228
That's the thing,
no one knew.

346
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:45,898
Seems he really
doesn't have any.

347
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,845
We're going to need a Iist
of all the boys that were
absent the day of the murder,

348
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:53,278
and we're going to
need your permission
to search their Iockers.

349
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,052
I find any dead animals
in here, I'm going to
deputize you for this.

350
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:05,286
Got him.

351
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,452
What'd you find?

352
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,189
Susan Oestreicher.

353
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,191
(BELL RINGING)

354
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:15,099
And the weapon
that killed her.

355
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:18,230
PRINCIPAL CORRALES:
This is a surprise.

356
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:22,743
Locker 142 belongs
to Zachary Connor,
a sixth-grader.

357
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:26,176
I'II get his schedule
and we'II find him
in his next class.

358
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:28,409
I think he found
us already.

359
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:30,779
What happened
to my Iocker?

360
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,816
STABLER: Zachary Connor
is 12 years old.

361
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:39,759
I tell you, I've been on
this job a Iong time,
some things still surprise me.

362
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:41,557
You'II get over it.
His parents coming in?

363
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,393
They should
be here any minute.

364
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:45,729
We're going on 12 hours
holding Jeremy Brice.

365
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,598
He and his mother are
still in interrogation.

366
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:52,072
And they're staying until we
know his exact involvement
in this woman's death.

367
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,698
Munch is still
at the crime Iab.

368
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:56,300
CSU Iifted three
sets of prints off
of that knife.

369
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:59,609
One unknown,
one the victim's,
and one belonging to Jeremy.

370
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:03,777
Captain, these are
Zachary Connor's parents.

371
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:05,945
Mr. and Mrs. Connor,
thank you for making it down.

372
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:08,649
Nobody's told us anything.
Is Zach all right?

373
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:09,849
Well, he's fine. Fine.

374
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:12,359
We think he might know
something about a crime.

375
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:14,122
Now, Ted here
will get you settled,

376
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:16,858
and in a minute
a detective will
explain everything to you.

377
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:19,457
He's never been in
trouble before, Captain.
Not once.

378
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,798
Is that true?
No trouble with this boy?

379
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,207
Straight As.
Not a mark on
his school record.

380
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:31,973
Let's go easy on this.

381
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:34,311
Finesse them.
See if one turns
on the other.

382
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:35,872
Fin, you take
Zachary and his parents.

383
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:38,283
You guys take
another run at Jeremy.

384
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:40,947
Set up video cameras
and monitors in both rooms.

385
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:43,217
I'II call in Cabot
and Huang to observe.

386
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:47,053
FIN: Remember where
you were day before
yesterday, Zachary?

387
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:48,892
At school.
And then I went home.

388
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:50,795
You there all day?
Yeah.

389
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:52,094
Well, I talked
to your teachers,

390
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:55,136
and they said that you missed
all your classes after Iunch.

391
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,727
I was in the Iibrary.

392
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,134
I had to study
for a math test.

393
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,834
He does have
a big test coming up.

394
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:03,434
Okay. You know
Jeremy Brice?

395
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:04,706
He's a seventh-grader.

396
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:05,837
Friend of yours?

397
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:07,211
No. I don't
Iike him.

398
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:10,641
You didn't hang
out with him at all
day before yesterday?

399
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,187
No. He's dorky.
And he's a bully.

400
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:15,949
You got a knife, Zach?

401
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,116
A what?

402
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,659
You mean the one
in my Iocker.

403
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:21,320
FIN: Where'd you get it?

404
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:25,433
I found it in the dumpster
behind the school.
And the wallet, too.

405
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,525
What were you
Iooking for
in the garbage?

406
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:30,735
Well, sometimes they
throw out cool things.

407
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,568
Once I found
new markers.

408
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:33,972
Yeah, that is cool.

409
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:37,944
So why'd you take
the knife and wallet
and put them in your Iocker?

410
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,378
I was gonna
turn them in.

411
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:42,575
I thought someone Iost them.
But then I forgot.

412
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:44,380
Did you know there
was blood on that knife?

413
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,919
MRS. CONNOR: Oh, my God.

414
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:47,955
I thought it was fake.

415
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:51,151
But you should ask Jeremy.
He told me where to find it.

416
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:54,357
STABLER: So, Jeremy,
you want a drink?

417
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:55,862
No. I want to go home.

418
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:56,023
Well, I know you do.

419
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:59,226
But the reason that we have
to stay here is because you're
not telling us the truth.

420
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:00,735
Yes, I am.

421
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:03,636
Jeremy, we picked up
your friend Zachary
at school today.

422
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,139
Zach's here?

423
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,302
He's right in the next room,
speaking to one
of our detectives.

424
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:11,646
What do you think
he's going to say?

425
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:14,444
Nothing.

426
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:17,043
I think he might.

427
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,818
Look, I know you don't want
to get him in trouble,

428
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,757
but you've got to
tell us what happened.

429
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:27,284
Even if it's something that's
really, really bad,
you've got to tell us.

430
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:33,831
Zach's my best friend.

431
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:36,667
You can't make me say
he did something bad.

432
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:38,969
He didn't do anything.

433
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:43,436
Jeremy's in for
a rude awakening.

434
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:45,104
His best friend's
about to flip on him.

435
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:49,083
What I find hard to
believe is how a kid
as young as Zachary

436
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:50,846
is physically
capable of rape.

437
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,686
Biologically, all he needs
is enough testosterone
to achieve an erection.

438
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:57,726
These days,
boys reach puberty
as early as nine years old.

439
00:20:57,793 --> 00:21:00,785
Add to that an ill woman,
weakened by chemotherapy.

440
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:03,832
She's the perfect victim
for a 90-pound rapist.

441
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:05,662
You think he did it?

442
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:08,326
I think he's Iying.

443
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:12,067
He keeps changing his story
so that it's just
plausible enough to be true.

444
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:13,631
He's involved.

445
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:17,938
What's all this?

446
00:21:18,014 --> 00:21:19,572
Interrogation tactics,
Captain.

447
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:22,447
A few special mementos
from Zachary Connor's Iocker.

448
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,645
This is Detective Munch,
my partner.

449
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:28,485
MR. CONNOR: How much Ionger
do we need to be here?

450
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:30,388
Entirely up to your son,
Mr. Connor.

451
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,653
Is that your book?

452
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,888
I don't know.
AII our books
Iook alike.

453
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:36,124
Oh, yeah?
Is that your name?

454
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,393
Yeah.
Then that must
be yours, right?

455
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,666
What is this about?
It's his book.
Why does it matter?

456
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:47,641
We also have a CD
Iabeled with your initials,

457
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,942
a pen, a magazine subscription
sticker in your name.

458
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:54,005
You know where I got them?

459
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,448
In my Iocker at school?

460
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:58,180
Right. You know what else
they have in common? Hmm?

461
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:00,251
Detective Tutuola?

462
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:02,257
Covered with
his fingerprints.

463
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:03,883
MUNCH: Correct.
Just a minute.

464
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,483
Now, Zach,
you're a bright young man.

465
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:08,530
You understand that every
time you touch something,

466
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:10,531
you Ieave a
fingerprint behind.

467
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,432
So I want you to think
real hard before you
answer this question.

468
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:17,404
Were you ever in
an apartment on Avenue C
where a woman was killed?

469
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:19,134
Oh, what the hell?

470
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,846
I was in that Iady's
apartment with Jeremy.

471
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:29,182
He killed her.

472
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:36,389
Hey, Jeremy,
I think you might
want to see this.

473
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:39,388
FIN: Whose idea was it?

474
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,427
Jeremy's.

475
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:45,024
FIN: To rob her
or to kill her?

476
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:46,800
ZACHARY: Everything.

477
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:49,766
He said she had
lots of money.

478
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:53,141
But then she came home.

479
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:57,443
He made me do
bad things to her.

480
00:22:57,513 --> 00:22:59,344
He made me touch her.

481
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,913
And then Jeremy got the knife

482
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,215
and he killed her.

483
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,216
FIN: What happened after that?

484
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,690
I ran away.

485
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:14,485
I was scared.

486
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,898
Jeremy. No.

487
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:22,199
Jeremy, is that
what happened?

488
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:23,761
He's Iying!

489
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,065
So you tell us the truth.

490
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:33,508
I didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

491
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:37,950
Was it your idea to break
into that woman's apartment?

492
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,580
Jeremy, why would
you do that?

493
00:23:43,592 --> 00:23:46,026
Zach thought it was cool.

494
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:48,996
STABLER: Was it cool when
you took the telephone
and bashed her head in?

495
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:52,329
I didn't do that, Zach did.

496
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,232
Do I Iisten to
his story or yours?

497
00:23:57,173 --> 00:23:58,697
She fell down.

498
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:01,570
She was bleeding.

499
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:05,578
Zach said to get
a knife from the kitchen.

500
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:10,014
I didn't want to,
but he was screaming at me.

501
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,418
I didn't know what
he was going to do
with it, I swear.

502
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:17,585
So you got the knife,
and then what happened?

503
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:23,691
When I walked back in,
Zach was on top of her.

504
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:28,726
He took the knife
and he stabbed
her over and over.

505
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,898
There was all this
blood and I threw up!

506
00:24:31,974 --> 00:24:35,375
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry!

507
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:38,141
(SOBBING)

508
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:39,471
I'm sorry.

509
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:42,449
Jeremy, who covered her up
with the blanket?

510
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,614
I did.

511
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:49,684
You shouldn't Ieave
someone Iike that.

512
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,321
Can I go home now?

513
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:56,097
I just want to go home.

514
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:59,094
I want to go home.

515
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:02,365
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

516
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,943
CSU finished
with Zach's house?

517
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:12,003
Top to bottom. No blood.
Must have tossed the clothes
he was wearing.

518
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,810
So we've got two kids,
two different stories,

519
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:15,475
and either one of them
could have killed her.

520
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:17,849
Which means I have
an even bigger problem.

521
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,582
Whether or not to
try Jeremy Brice
as an adult.

522
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:22,146
Zachary Connor is 12.

523
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:25,022
So even if he acted alone,
he's out of my jurisdiction.

524
00:25:25,094 --> 00:25:26,618
He is going
to Family Court.

525
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:29,061
And what kind of punishment
is kiddie court handing out

526
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:30,894
for rapists and murderers
these days?

527
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,298
Their mandate is
rehabilitation,
not punishment.

528
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:37,829
So the maximum
sentence is 18 months
in a Iimited secure facility.

529
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:40,000
And Jeremy's Iooking
at Iife in Attica.

530
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:42,942
If the D.A. thinks
he's a danger
to society, yes.

531
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:46,140
Okay, I got to tell you
that I believe Jeremy's
version of the events.

532
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:49,844
You know,
this kid is more of a danger
to himself than anybody else.

533
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,285
Doc, you saw both interviews.
What do you think?

534
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:53,946
I agree with you.

535
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:55,786
Jeremy is more
easily manipulated.

536
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:56,951
He's desperate to
fit in at any cost,

537
00:25:57,027 --> 00:25:59,587
whereas Zachary is
far more calculating.

538
00:25:59,663 --> 00:26:02,131
I think he wields
a great deal of control
over Jeremy,

539
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:05,599
and I think he
murdered and raped
Susan Oestreicher.

540
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:10,735
So the question is
do we go after Jeremy
because we can't get Zachary?

541
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,267
No.

542
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:17,304
I'II recommend
we remove Jeremy
to family court.

543
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:30,655
The D.A. is seeking
an indictment against
Jeremy Brice.

544
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:32,820
You've got one day
to prepare for
the grand jury.

545
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:34,523
On what charges?

546
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:36,122
Felony murder
and burglary one.

547
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,133
I recommended against it.

548
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:39,463
Well, the D.A. disagreed.

549
00:26:39,536 --> 00:26:43,939
But the evidence clearly
indicates that Jeremy Brice's
involvement was Iimited.

550
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:46,475
The DNA proves
that Zachary Connor
committed the rape.

551
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:49,706
Jeremy already confessed
to participating
in the burglary.

552
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:50,803
That's the predicate felony.

553
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,905
He knew it was dangerous,
he knew someone
could be killed.

554
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:54,473
No, he didn't.

555
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:57,179
This boy is not mature
enough to understand that.

556
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:59,050
The Iaw says he is.

557
00:26:59,122 --> 00:27:02,421
That Iegislation
was passed in 1978

558
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:05,859
as a knee-jerk reaction
to some perceived
youth crime wave.

559
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:08,523
It also says that
we prosecute
juveniles as adults

560
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:11,499
at the discretion of
the district attorney.

561
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:14,002
He made the call.
You do your job.

562
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:17,037
Which should be easy enough
with Jeremy's confession.

563
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,141
A win for the D.A.

564
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,178
So that's what this is about.

565
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:23,974
'Cause I'd Iike to know just
how much of a sycophant

566
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:26,845
I have to be in this
new administration.

567
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:30,549
Let's say you're right.

568
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,349
Let's say Zachary Connor
did everything.

569
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:35,914
That means every
step of the way,
Jeremy Brice had a choice.

570
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:38,686
Do the right thing
or do the wrong thing.

571
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:43,594
Watch your friend
rape a defenseless
woman or stop him,

572
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,602
run away or
give him the knife
so he can stab her to death.

573
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:49,402
Do we punish
him for this?

574
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:52,805
Or do we tell him that
there are no consequences
for his actions?

575
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:56,437
We remove him to Family Court
in hopes of rehabilitation.

576
00:27:57,347 --> 00:28:00,373
That won't happen if he goes
J.O. and you know it.

577
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,749
You have more faith in
the Juvenile Justice
Department than I do.

578
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:11,087
You're adamantly opposed
to prosecuting this case?

579
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:13,925
Yes. I think it's wrong.

580
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:16,930
AII right.

581
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:19,459
Then I'II do it.

582
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:23,568
You're second chair.

583
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:32,877
EIizabeth Donnelly
is back trying cases?

584
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:36,146
Or did your new boss
demote you already?

585
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:39,916
Funny comments Iike that,
it's a wonder both
your Iegs aren't broken.

586
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:42,253
You get attacked
by one of your repeat
offenders again?

587
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:45,590
No, actually one of your
esteemed colleagues
knocked me off a curb.

588
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:47,152
There's a
Iaw suit pending.

589
00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:51,056
AIexandra Cabot,
Gina Bernardo,
public defender.

590
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:52,158
Nice to meet you.

591
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:56,433
So the D.A. has assembled
a Iegal dream team
to crucify a child.

592
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:58,838
You know as well as I do
charging Jeremy Brice

593
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:01,103
as an adult is
a gross injustice.

594
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:02,940
Tell that to
Susan Oestreicher's family.

595
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:06,413
You honestly believe
he deserves to be
charged for murder two?

596
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,314
The grand jury did.

597
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:11,319
You can't possibly hold
my client responsible
for something

598
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:14,481
it's impossible for him
to be responsible for.

599
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:17,586
Notification of
affirmative defense.

600
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,857
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

601
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:24,798
What defect?

602
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:28,235
His 14-year-old brain.

603
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:30,929
DONNELLY: Your Honor,
this is an obvious attempt

604
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:32,531
to backdoor
the defense of infancy.

605
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:36,773
Article 30 clearly states that
defense cannot be used for
juveniles charged with murder.

606
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:40,304
I'm not saying that my
client isn't responsible
because of his age.

607
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:43,648
I am saying he isn't
responsible because
of his diminished capacity.

608
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,814
Dictated by his age.
It's the same thing.

609
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,381
This is a Iegislative issue,
Your Honor, not a matter
for the court.

610
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:53,054
Then why did three
Supreme Court justices
draft a public statement

611
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:55,689
calling for the abolishment
of juvenile executions?

612
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:59,963
Because it is cruel and
unusual to impose adult
punishment on someone

613
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:01,901
who isn't capable
of adult thought.

614
00:30:01,971 --> 00:30:04,166
Couldn't one argue then
that certain behavior,

615
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,540
such as the committing
of a violent crime,
proves adult thought?

616
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:11,978
No. If your 10-year-old
son takes your car
out for a joy ride,

617
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:14,380
do you automatically
hand him
a driver's Iicense?

618
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,042
This is all very interesting,
Ms. Bernardo,

619
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,350
but I fail to see
how any of this applies
to an insanity defense.

620
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:21,185
These are scientific studies

621
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:25,193
proving that an adolescent's
brain is significantly
different than an aduIt's.

622
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:29,129
That, in fact, our brains
aren't fully formed until
we're in our early 20s.

623
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:31,258
And I can present scientific
studies which prove

624
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:33,996
my cat is trying
to kill me in my sleep.

625
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,230
Daubert test, Your Honor.

626
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:38,741
Scientific evidence must meet
federal standards of relevance
and reliability.

627
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:42,266
Well, one of the studies was
done by the National Institute
of Mental Health.

628
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:44,677
Is the federal government
reliable enough for you?

629
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:47,944
The reliability
of the studies
isn't in question.

630
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:52,147
My job is to determine
whether or not they have
any material value.

631
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:53,883
I believe they do.

632
00:30:54,757 --> 00:30:57,521
And I believe
the jury should hear them.

633
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:05,900
Dr. Hayman, can you
tell us about the study
you recently completed?

634
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:08,733
We used functional magnetic
resonance imaging

635
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:11,774
to map the brains of healthy
adolescents over several years

636
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:14,071
and compared them
to those of healthy adults.

637
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:16,202
And what did your study find?

638
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:19,806
For adolescents,
brain activity is much
higher in the amygdala,

639
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:23,011
which guides instincts
Iike fear or anger.

640
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:26,317
In adults, the activity
in the frontal
Iobe is higher,

641
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:29,620
and that's the seat
of reasoning and
good judgment.

642
00:31:29,692 --> 00:31:32,661
BERNARDO: So what are
the conclusions of
your findings?

643
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:36,187
Adolescents are
physiologically prone

644
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,530
to impulsive and
irrational behavior.

645
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:45,006
So teenagers are moody
and unpredictable,
and even violent,

646
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:46,974
because they are
wired that way?

647
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:48,772
Objection. Leading.

648
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:50,210
Sustained.

649
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,680
That's all.
No further questions.

650
00:31:55,818 --> 00:32:02,690
So, your study says
that teenagers are
impulsive and irrational.

651
00:32:06,396 --> 00:32:08,796
Here's what
I don't understand.

652
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:12,858
If that's true,
how is it that
every single teenager

653
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:15,461
isn't a rapist or a murderer?

654
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:19,372
I believe I said
adolescents were prone
to certain behaviors.

655
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:23,378
Then some teenagers
are perfectly
reasonable and rational.

656
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:24,538
Yes.

657
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:26,510
How many?

658
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:29,442
How many what?

659
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,080
How many teenagers are
rational and how many are
rapists and murderers?

660
00:32:34,123 --> 00:32:35,556
There's no answer
to that question.

661
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,092
I thought you
mapped their brains.

662
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,095
We haven't tested
every single teenager
in the world.

663
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:45,598
Oh. So if you had given MRIs
to every single teenager,

664
00:32:45,668 --> 00:32:49,263
you would be able to predict
whether or not they would be
a criminal. Is that it?

665
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,136
No.
Well, what?

666
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:54,074
If the irrational
part of the brain
is overactive,

667
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:56,373
that proves that
they'II be violent,
doesn't it?

668
00:32:56,446 --> 00:32:58,311
It doesn't
prove anything.

669
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:00,474
This research is
in its infancy.

670
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,443
Your study doesn't
prove anything?

671
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,180
Not what you're
asking for, but...

672
00:33:05,254 --> 00:33:08,087
Then it's a theory,
an unproven theory.

673
00:33:08,157 --> 00:33:10,625
This research is
a huge step forward

674
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:12,285
in understanding
how the brain works.

675
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:16,093
Which is just another way
of saying we really don't
understand the brain at all.

676
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:20,760
Nothing further.

677
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,468
BERNARDO: Jeremy, do you know
the difference between
what's right and what's wrong?

678
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:30,403
Yes.

679
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,041
Was it wrong to break
into Susan Oestreicher's
apartment?

680
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:36,711
Yes.

681
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,585
Then why did you do it?

682
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:42,152
Zach said he
wanted some money.

683
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:44,022
Do you always do
what Zach wants?

684
00:33:45,228 --> 00:33:46,991
He's my best friend.

685
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:50,089
Jeremy, did you know
that Zach was planning
to kill that woman?

686
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:52,258
JEREMY: No.

687
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:55,136
And if you thought
even for one moment

688
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:56,899
that that's what
he wanted to do,

689
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:58,531
would you have gone
with him to the apartment,

690
00:33:58,608 --> 00:34:00,735
even though he's
your best friend?

691
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,936
No.

692
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:05,072
I don't want
anyone to get killed.

693
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:07,048
BERNARDO: Jeremy,
what is more wrong?

694
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:11,382
Watching someone do something
terrible or telling on your
only friend?

695
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:17,492
I don't know.

696
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:22,262
So, maybe, you don't
know right from wrong
as much as you think.

697
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:27,129
Thank you, Jeremy.

698
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,470
Who hit Susan Oestreicher
over the head?

699
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,302
Zach.

700
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:38,507
Hard enough so she
was knocked out, right?

701
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:39,605
Yeah.

702
00:34:39,682 --> 00:34:42,207
Then Zach told you
to get the knife.

703
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:46,246
He... He said to
Iook in the kitchen.

704
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:48,017
Did you think he
was going to stab her?

705
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:49,750
No.

706
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,817
What did you think
he was going to do?

707
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:56,055
Scare her.
He didn't want
her to yell.

708
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:58,930
But she wasn't awake.
How would she yell?

709
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,265
I don't know.

710
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:04,636
What do people do
with knives, Jeremy?

711
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:08,441
Cut things.

712
00:35:08,978 --> 00:35:12,379
So you walked
into the kitchen
and you got the knife.

713
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:13,506
Yes.

714
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,375
You said you were
afraid of Zach. Why?

715
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:17,851
He was yelling at me.

716
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,320
Why didn't you
walk out the door?

717
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:25,794
I don't know.

718
00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:31,857
So, you got the knife.

719
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:34,832
You walked back to Zach,

720
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:37,873
and you were holding
the knife in your hands.

721
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,100
Yes.

722
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:40,904
Why did you
give it to him?

723
00:35:40,977 --> 00:35:43,138
Was it because you were
afraid or because you

724
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:45,806
wanted to be
cool for your friend?

725
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:46,940
I don't know!

726
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:49,109
You knew what he
was going to do,

727
00:35:49,185 --> 00:35:51,551
and you helped him do it.
Isn't that why?

728
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:54,589
I'm sorry!

729
00:35:56,192 --> 00:35:58,319
I'm so sorry.

730
00:35:58,394 --> 00:35:59,884
I'm so sorry.

731
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:01,793
I'm sorry.

732
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:03,863
I'm sorry.

733
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:07,892
(JEREMY SOBBING)

734
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:13,666
Nothing further.

735
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,507
I'm so sorry.

736
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:27,951
AIex.

737
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:31,750
Well, guess you got
what you wanted.

738
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:36,763
Destroying a child on
the stand is not quite
the highlight of my career.

739
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,458
You did your job.

740
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:40,627
Careful, AIex.

741
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:44,799
You're beginning to sound
Iike me, disillusioned
before your time.

742
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:48,636
I need you to subpoena
a rebuttal witness.

743
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:49,973
Who?
Zachary Connor.

744
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,138
Why?

745
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:53,512
As of today,
he's been adjudicated
by Family Court.

746
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:57,144
Any testimony he gives
won't be tainted
by his co-conspirator status.

747
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,710
If you put Zachary Connor
on the stand,

748
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:01,757
he's going to say that
Jeremy did everything and
I believe that's a Iie.

749
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,657
I'm not putting him
on the stand. You are.

750
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:07,491
Jury already thinks
I make Iittle kids cry.

751
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:09,428
No. I won't
suborn perjury.

752
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:12,365
Then I guess you
better make sure
he tells the truth.

753
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:23,404
CABOT: Zachary,
who killed Susan Oestreicher?

754
00:37:24,513 --> 00:37:25,878
Jeremy did.

755
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:28,311
So he stabbed
her with a knife?

756
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:29,681
Yes.

757
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,277
That must have been
very frightening for you.

758
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:34,186
Yes. I was scared.

759
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:35,986
What were you scared of?

760
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:37,252
Jeremy.

761
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:38,851
Why?

762
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:41,158
Because he's bigger.

763
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:44,090
Was Jeremy
afraid of anything?

764
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,224
Yes.

765
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:46,760
What?

766
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:49,470
He was just afraid.
He didn't want to get caught.

767
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:51,096
But you did get caught.

768
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:52,663
Miss Oestreicher came home.

769
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:55,575
That was Jeremy's fault.
He got it wrong.

770
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:58,276
You must have been really
scared when she walked in
that door?

771
00:37:58,347 --> 00:37:59,814
No, I wasn't.

772
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:00,940
Okay.

773
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:04,849
Zachary, when did
you throw up?

774
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:06,847
That was Jeremy.

775
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:09,288
I thought you
were afraid, Zachary.

776
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,384
I thought you threw up
because you couldn't
Iook at the blood.

777
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:14,929
I could, too.
Jeremy couldn't.

778
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:16,760
He was being a baby
and crying.

779
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,164
When? Before or after
she was killed?

780
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:20,395
The whole time.

781
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:22,699
And you weren't crying?
Not even just a Iittle?

782
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:23,864
No.

783
00:38:23,939 --> 00:38:25,372
But I thought you
were afraid, Zachary.

784
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:27,705
I thought you were
afraid of Jeremy.

785
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:28,971
No, I wasn't.

786
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:32,208
And you were also afraid
of that woman because she
was going to call the police.

787
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:33,339
She was afraid of me.

788
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,884
And you wanted to show
them both that you were a man,

789
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:37,350
and that's why you
had sex with her.

790
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,480
Well, that was her fault
because she wouldn't tell
me where the money was.

791
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:43,787
Jeremy was crying!
He wouldn't do anything
so I had to do it!

792
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:47,226
If she had just told me where
the money was, I wouldn't have
had to hurt her!

793
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:51,958
Nothing further.

794
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:03,805
Five to 10 years.

795
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,540
He wouldn't get out
until he was 24?

796
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:09,743
It's the minimum sentence.
With good behavior,
he's out in five.

797
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:12,913
But if they say not guilty,
he won't go to jail at all.

798
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:17,448
The jury will not say that.
The Iaw is very clear.

799
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:19,494
Jeremy already admitted
to being in the apartment

800
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:22,463
with the intent to burglarize
it and someone was killed.

801
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:25,866
He can still be found
guilty of felony murder.

802
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:28,529
You want me to tell you
to send my son to jail.

803
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:31,368
Why don't we take a day
to think about this?

804
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,465
No. I don't need
to think about it.

805
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,739
The answer is no.
He didn't hurt anyone.

806
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:42,250
Mrs. Brice, if Jeremy is
convicted, he is facing
a possible Iife sentence.

807
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:48,787
Miss Bernardo, please tell
your client's mother how
rare jury nullification is.

808
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:50,485
We should take the deal.

809
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,524
I don't Iike taking
chances with the jury.

810
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:55,354
They heard that other boy.

811
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:59,094
They know Jeremy is good,
and they won't
send him to jail.

812
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:00,965
No.

813
00:40:01,537 --> 00:40:02,765
No deal.

814
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:14,478
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

815
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,313

817

We find the defendant guilty.

818
00:40:23,392 --> 00:40:24,859
No!

819
00:40:28,097 --> 00:40:31,897
RIDENOUR: On the second count,
burglary in the first degree,
how do you find?

We find
the defendant guilty.

821
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:40,432
Poll the jury, Your Honor.

822
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:43,205

827

829
00:40:56,492 --> 00:40:57,584

831
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:00,521

Juror number six?

833
00:41:01,964 --> 00:41:03,226
Guilty.

834
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:05,392
Juror number seven?

835
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:06,696
Guilty.
