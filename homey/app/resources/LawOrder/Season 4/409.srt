1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:03,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:05,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:07,872
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:11,607
are members
of an elite squad known as
the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,649
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:19,219
Yeah. Okay, thanks.
Come on.

8
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:22,457
Go, go, go!

9
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:39,063
Police! NYPD!
We have a search warrant!

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,534
What the hell?

11
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:44,611
Somebody got here
before us.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,308
Secure it.
I don't want
any surprises.

13
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:49,313
OFFICER 1: Too Iate.

14
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:59,124
I better call in SVU.

15
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:01,929
We are not handing
this bust over to them.

16
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,591
Don't worry.
I got a buddy.

17
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:07,729
FIN: Better be good.

18
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:09,829
Anonymous phone tip
said somebody was dealing.

19
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:13,398
We surveilled a week,
caught a Iot of traffic
in and out of this place.

20
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:18,846
Get our warrant, bust in,
find our alleged
dealer sliced and diced.

21
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:22,407
Signs of burglary, and by her
appearance I'm guessing she's
been raped, too.

22
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:26,888
But, you know, I wanted
a trained SVU detective
Iike yourself on the case.

23
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,481
Rape-homicide falls
on SVU no matter what.

24
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:32,084
You didn't have to
hand it to me personally.

25
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,994
There's a big haul here.
Looks good for my guys
to turn it in.

26
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:38,465
Yeah, right.
You get all the glory
and we get all the work.

27
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:42,937
So you trying to tell me
that Laura Ashley here
is some kind of big kingpin?

28
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:44,472
Where are the drugs?

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,098
You didn't get
the complete tour.

30
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,011
Over two hundred plants.

31
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:01,386
Pull in a couple
of hundred thou
on the street.

32
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:05,260
Perp missed the jackpot.

33
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:57,838
M.E. estimates TOD
yesterday between
9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.

34
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:00,439
Looked Iike about
30 to 40 stab wounds.

35
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:01,778
Overkill.

36
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:05,284
He either knew her
well enough to hate her
or he's psychotic.

37
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:07,117
Point of entry Iooks Iike
the fire escape window.

38
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,055
Perp probably waltzed
out the front door.

39
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,559
Got minimal fluids
from the rape kit,
but enough to test.

40
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:12,753
You Iocate a
murder weapon?

41
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:13,886
Must've taken
it with him.

42
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:15,931
Three-inch, single-edged,
non-serrated blade.

43
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:18,125
About the size of the knife
missing from this?

44
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,396
Yeah. The other
weapon he Ieft behind.

45
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:24,165
Bashed in the back of her
head before he stabbed her.

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,868
Probably enough
to knock her out.
No defensive wounds.

47
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:29,309
It's not the most
obvious weapon.

48
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,278
So she surprises him.

49
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:34,079
Probably picked up
the first thing
he could grab.

50
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,449
Then he walks all the way
across the apartment
for a knife?

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,953
This guy's Iogic is
all over the place.

52
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:41,046
Maybe he's mentally ill.
Or high.

53
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:43,785
LAYTON: He covered
Mrs. Oestreicher with this.

54
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,159
By the amount of blood on
the blanket, I'd say right
after he stabbed her.

55
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:52,258
So afterwards
he gets remorseful,
embarrassed?

56
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,825
And then sick.

57
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,532
Our guy must
have thrown up.

58
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,636
It's too far away
to be the victim's.

59
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,972
Okay, Iet's send
a sample to the M.E.

60
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:04,808
We can compare it to
the stomach contents of our
victim, just to be sure.

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,938
LAYTON: I Iove my job.

62
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,482
What do we know about
this anonymous phone tip?

63
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,040
Narcotics traced
it to a neighbor.

64
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:11,382
Said she's nosy,
but not homicidal.

65
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:13,854
I thought anonymous
tip meant anonymous.

66
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:16,084
Like nobody would
bug you about doing
your civic duty.

67
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:17,625
We certainly don't mean
to inconvenience you.

68
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:20,355
But there was a woman
murdered in your building.

69
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:21,987
I know. I'm sorry
about that.

70
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,692
But you Iive
that kind of Iife,
you're asking for it.

71
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,359
And what kind
of Iife is that?

72
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:29,427
Criminal. You should've
been here when she was
sparking up.

73
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:30,802
Just walking down
the hall you'd get a buzz.

74
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:32,898
Marc, get in there
and brush those teeth now.

75
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,670
So you reported
Mrs. Oestreicher

76
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:38,510
as a drug dealer
because you smelled dope.
That was the only reason?

77
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,879
What about the daily
Easter parade?

78
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,182
In and out of there,
people banging on the door
all hours of the day.

79
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:49,088
Did you ever actually
see any of these deals,
any money changing hands?

80
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:53,026
No. No, but if she wasn't
selling, I don't know where
she got her money.

81
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,620
She hasn't worked
a day in over a year.

82
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:57,097
Autopsy's done.

83
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,794
So are the preliminary
Iabs on the fluids from
the rape kit.

84
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,302
Anything interesting?

85
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,735
Your perp had no sperm.

86
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:04,796
Interesting and pathetic.

87
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:08,537
I'm not talking
Iow sperm count.
This is azoospermia.

88
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,876
Zero sperm in the ejaculate.
It's pretty rare.

89
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:13,744
So our guy
got a vasectomy.

90
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:15,579
That's one
explanation for it.

91
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:19,451
It's also a sign of
Kartagener's Syndrome
and Cystic Fibrosis.

92
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:22,787
The Iab can still extract
DNA from the skin
cells in the sample.

93
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:24,382
And they're
analyzing the vomit.

94
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,927
We know who puked?

95
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:29,522
Victim hadn't eaten
in hours, so it had to
come from your perp.

96
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,532
As far as Miss Oestreicher
is concerned,

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,626
I suspect she would have died
within the year, had she not
been murdered.

98
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:35,932
What was
wrong with her?

99
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:37,905
Advanced
ovarian cancer.

100
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,806
She has small radiation burns
on the skin of her abdomen,

101
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:43,436
and blood tests reveal
Taxol and carboplatin.

102
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:45,070
She was undergoing
chemotherapy.

103
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:47,047
That explains why
she didn't have a job.

104
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,084
And why she was
growing pot.

105
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:52,211
Must have been using it
to counteract the side effects
of the cancer treatment.

106
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:54,654
Decent Ievels of
THC in her system.

107
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:56,521
But that woman was growing
a forest in there.

108
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:58,560
You think she was
toking on all that
by herself?

109
00:05:58,627 --> 00:05:59,651
Maybe she wasn't.

110
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:02,254
You know, medicinal
marijuana clubs are
popping up everywhere.

111
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:05,698
People are pooling their
resources, growing their
own stuff.

112
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,929
Better product without
having to pay street prices.

113
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:10,938
Well, if she's running a club,
then there has to be
a membership Iist.

114
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:16,801
How many people
we Iooking at?

115
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,574
According to her
day planner,
nearly 100.

116
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:21,047
But there's no names.
She only writes initials.

117
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:24,177
We got C.K. down
the second Monday
of every month.

118
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,016
J.A.S. every
other Saturday.

119
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,648
Probably a schedule.
Members take turns
tending the crop.

120
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:30,282
Why the hell you
know so much about it?

121
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:33,522
Twenty-five years on the job
and he's still a damn hippie.

122
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:37,259
Okay, I got the phone dumps
from Susan Oestreicher
for the past six months.

123
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,029
We got to match the names
with the initials and weed
out the potheads.

124
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:42,263
Find one club member,
might Iead us to the rest.

125
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:45,034
Convincing somebody
to turn over that Iist
is not going to be easy.

126
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:48,770
People Iooking at
a narcotics rap tend
to be real cooperative.

127
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:51,142
Threatening cancer patients.
Now, that's why
I became a cop.

128
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:54,046
They're breaking the Iaw.
I don't care how sick
they are.

129
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:57,517
Do you have any idea
why cannabis is
illegal in this country?

130
00:06:57,586 --> 00:06:59,486
Because William Randolph
Hearst's paper mills

131
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,954
were threatened by
the hemp industry.

132
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:03,389
And that's got nothing
to do with the fact that
it's a drug.

133
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,949
What do you call
alcohol and tobacco?

134
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:06,460
Legal.

135
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:07,791
Here we go.

136
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:10,195
For the initials C.K.,
we've got a Cindy Kerber.

137
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:15,795
C.K. C.K. Charles Kelsey,
Christian Kessler.
This is going to be fun.

138
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:16,997
We'II run them all down.

139
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,939
If they had access
to the victim,
they're all suspects.

140
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:25,437
STABLER: We know about
your club, Miss Kerber.

141
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:27,505
Then I assume you found
what we were growing.

142
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,778
Pretty tough to miss.
You guys have
very green thumbs.

143
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:32,252
We're not hurting
anyone and we're
not making a profit.

144
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,221
We are investigating
a murder.

145
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,157
Now, all we need
are the other names
of the members in the club.

146
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,023
The rest is between us.

147
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:41,562
I don't know most of
the people involved.
We don't socialize.

148
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,291
Give us the names
of the people
you do know.

149
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,094
I'm sorry. I can't.

150
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,794
This woman
was raped.

151
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,427
She was stabbed
38 times.

152
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:52,031
You don't want to help us
in our investigation?
That is very strange to me.

153
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:54,098
Because it wasn't
anyone in the club.

154
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:58,078
Some of these people were
debilitated from nausea,
from chemotherapy.

155
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:02,846
The only thing that controls
my tremors from M.S.
is smoking once in a while.

156
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:04,943
Why would we kill the woman
who was helping us?

157
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,750
Maybe she was
helping the wrong person.

158
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:10,883
Somebody's sick,
doesn't make
them an angel.

159
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,693
There was some trouble
with this one woman, Becky.
Not her, really. Her husband.

160
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:17,698
What kind of trouble?

161
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:22,328
He threatened Sue.
Said she hooked
his wife on drugs.

162
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,872
Becky was dying
from metastatic
breast cancer,

163
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,340
and he wouldn't allow her
the tiniest bit of relief.

164
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,377
Well, do you think
that he's capable
of murder?

165
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,106
I know his own wife
was afraid of him.

166
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,776
Especially after he broke
some guy's back in a bar
fight. Went to jail for it.

167
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,284
I wouldn't
touch that bitch.

168
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:40,914
Isn't it refreshing to hear
such militant adherence to
the "Just Say No" philosophy?

169
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,014
It's so rare
in convicts.

170
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:43,786
That incident
was an accident.

171
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:47,420
I did five years inside,
and now my wife's dead.

172
00:08:47,496 --> 00:08:49,760
I paid the price.
Go bother somebody else.

173
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:51,265
No, we're bothering you,
Mr. Paglione.

174
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,063
You got an awful Iot of hate
for the woman who was trying
to comfort your wife.

175
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,865
Yeah, that's a real
beautiful story.

176
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:59,897
Until one of you comes to my
house and finds drugs and
busts me for parole violation.

177
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,776
I was working from
6:00 in the morning
to 4:00, and no Iunch break.

178
00:09:07,116 --> 00:09:08,674
And that's all I'm saying.

179
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:15,787
BENSON: We'II see you
back at the house.

180
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:18,716
Munch says the husband's
alibi checks out.

181
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,318
This membership Iist
is getting smaller.

182
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,660
Half these people
are either dead or too
weak to get out of bed.

183
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:25,325
Maybe we're going
down the wrong path
with this pot club.

184
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:30,602
No, I just can't buy that
the murder and the drugs
are a coincidence.

185
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:33,540
Susan Oestreicher's neighbor
thought she was a drug dealer.

186
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:35,440
What if somebody
else thought so, too?

187
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:39,011
An M.E. out of the morgue?
Must be big.

188
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,912
Captain Cragen told me
you were here.

189
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:43,975
Lab finished analyzing
the vomit from
the crime scene.

190
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:46,681
Hey, am I gonna
want to stop eating
before I hear this?

191
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:51,419
Pieces of roast beef,
a Iittle mozzarella cheese,
kernels of corn and raisins.

192
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,461
Luckily, they hadn't been
in the stomach very Iong,

193
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,326
so everything was
only partially digested.

194
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:57,160
Yeah, I'm done.

195
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,598
And this is
good news because?

196
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,568
My daughter's in
the sixth grade.

197
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:05,664
She had that exact
meal for Iunch at school
on the day of the murder.

198
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:09,199
I've got the menu
on the fridge.
I called the Board of Ed.

199
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,736
Every middle school
in Manhattan serves
the same Iunch.

200
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:17,007
No sperm in the ejaculate.

201
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,455
We're Iooking for a kid.

202
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:24,649
Are we buying in to
this juvenile theory?

203
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,194
Well, it makes sense.

204
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:29,628
The disorganization of
the crime scene indicates
an immature thought process.

205
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:32,895
The number of stab wounds
could mean he has no real
understanding of physiology.

206
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:35,528
He just kills
the way he thinks that
you're supposed to kill.

207
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,731
The rape. Sexual curiosity.

208
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,331
Well, we know the kid went
to school that day Iong
enough to have Iunch,

209
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,240
so he must've
cut out afterwards.

210
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:45,109
Well, we're not canvassing
every junior high in the city,

211
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,549
and I'm not waiting for a DNA
analysis of the puke,
so Iet's hear suggestions.

212
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:53,281
Okay, we're Iooking for
a boy who has a history
of fights in school.

213
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:55,983
Minor vandalism with
risk-taking behavior.

214
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,491
Sounds Iike every
teenage boy on the planet.

215
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,925
I know.
It's not much
to go on.

216
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:02,520
But adolescent behavior
is inherently unpredictable.

217
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:04,566
That's why mental
health care professionals

218
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:07,830
won't Iabel a child
a sociopath even if
he fits the definition.

219
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,565
So the profile's wide open.
What else?

220
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,163
Juvies stay
with the familiar.

221
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,232
Maybe the victim
knew this kid.

222
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,004
And even if she didn't,
he's Iikely to commit

223
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,807
the crimes in his
own comfort zone.

224
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,939
The neighbor
who phoned in
the tip to Narcotics.

225
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,505
Her son Iooked
about 13, right?

226
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:27,021
That was Mrs. Lesinski
and her son Marc.

227
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,955
Maybe he Iistens to Mom
rail about the drug
dealer down the hall,

228
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:32,687
he figures he can get
himself some free dope.

229
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:35,787
And get some cash
for a new Xbox
while he's at it.

230
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,354
Check him out.

231
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:40,530
Look, I told you,
Marc didn't see who
killed her.

232
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:42,035
He was in school.

233
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:43,230
You're sure about that?

234
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,363
Of course I am.

235
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,738
And the school calls
if he skips class?

236
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,174
What exactly
are you asking?

237
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:50,677
Mrs. Lesinski,
we need to speak
with Marc right now.

238
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,008
You think he could
have done this?

239
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,015
He is a child.
Are you crazy?

240
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:58,241
Has Marc bought anything
that he doesn't have
the money for?

241
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,309
No.

242
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,447
Have you seen him with...

243
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:03,923
Seen him with anything
expensive that you
didn't give him?

244
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:07,757
He said it was
a present from
a friend.

245
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,559
STABLER: Come on over here.
Show it to us, will you?

246
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:15,793
An MP3 player.

247
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,131
Must be a very good friend
to be so generous.

248
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,700
No, the kid's a total geek.
He's always giving stuff
to people.

249
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:24,575
Oh. This total geek
have a name?

250
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:26,409
Jeremy Brice.

251
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:28,074
STABLER: Mmm-hmm. Where do
you think Jeremy got that?

252
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:32,619
Did you tell him that you
had a drug dealer Iiving
down the hall from you?

253
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:33,814
Yeah.
What'd you say?

254
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:38,887
I said that she's probably
got some pretty cool stuff,
you know, 'cause she deals.

255
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:42,624
BENSON: So don't you think
it's possible that he got it
from Mrs. Oestreicher's place?

256
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:44,290
I don't know, maybe.

257
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,266
But there's no way
Jeremy killed her.

258
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,165
Well, how do you
know that?

259
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,899
He's just not that cool.

260
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,201
(DOOR BELL RINGING)

261
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,573
It is almost 8:00.
Everybody's already Ieft.

262
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,669
Let's pull him
out of school.

263
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:02,177
Liv. Liv.
Kids waiting
for the bus.

264
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,856
Hi, guys.
Anyone know
Jeremy Brice?

265
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:11,051
Who?

266
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:12,150
Jeremy Brice.

267
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:13,285
There.

268
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:16,730
You Jeremy?

269
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,665
Relax, relax,
relax, Jeremy.

270
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:20,861
I didn't do anything!

271
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:23,131
We're the police.
We want to talk to you.
Just relax.

272
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:26,663
Jeremy, that Iooks
Iike blood.

273
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:28,972
No, it isn't.

274
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:31,569
We're going down to
the police station,
Jeremy, all right?

275
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:32,773
Where are
your parents?

276
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,713
I have to go to school.
I have to...

277
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:40,616
You made a mistake.
Jeremy was in school all day.

278
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:41,815
We checked, Mrs. Brice.

279
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,018
Jeremy's teachers told
us that he was absent
after Iunch.

280
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:46,458
You skipped school?

281
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:47,756
No.

282
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,129
Jeremy? Jeremy,
Iook at me a second.

283
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,496
You know you're
not supposed to Iie
to the police, right?

284
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,628
I'm not Iying.

285
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,468
STABLER: Where'd you get
the MP3 player you gave
to your buddy Marc?

286
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,409
I gave him that
for his birthday.

287
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:08,648
Do you know a Iady named
Susan Oestreicher?

288
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:09,809
No.

289
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:13,377
You sure? She's the woman that
Iives right next door to Marc.

290
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,855
Jeremy, you went
into that apartment,

291
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,085
and something bad
happened there,
didn't it?

292
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,923
I didn't go anywhere.

293
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:23,954
Jeremy, these are your
fingerprints that your mom
Iet us take when you got here.

294
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,358
Remember that?

295
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:33,363
These are the ones
that we found in
Miss Oestreicher's apartment.

296
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,141
They're exactly the same.

297
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,509
No, they're not.

298
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,380
STABLER: They are.
This tells me you
were in that apartment.

299
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:43,816
No, it doesn't.

300
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:46,252
Jeremy, what happened?

301
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:49,950
Nothing. Why is
everybody picking on me?

302
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,819
We'II take another crack
at him once he calms down.

303
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:56,558
Well, we know he
was in the apartment.

304
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:59,760
Once the Iabs come back on
the forensic evidence,
we won't need a confession.

305
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:00,927
A typical kid.

306
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:03,301
Thinks if he denies
everything,
it'II just go away.

307
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,535
He's 14. EIigible to
be tried as an adult.

308
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:09,805
Murder two.
Would've been
eligible if he was 13.

309
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:11,368
He Iook Iike
a grownup to you?

310
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:14,415
He brutally
raped and murdered
a 34-year-old woman.

311
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:15,507
That's a grownup crime.

312
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:18,280
He's not crying
for his victim,
he's crying for himself.

313
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:20,344
Guess you can't blame him.
His Iife is over.

314
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:24,791
Labs are back.
BIood on Jeremy's coat
matched the victim's type.

315
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,418
Sounds Iike your
job is done.

316
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:27,723
No. We're not that Iucky.

317
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,594
Lab's determined
that the rapist's
blood was a type B.

318
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,759
I got Jeremy's from
his school. He's type O.

319
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:34,597
He had a partner.
Yeah.

320
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,570
No sperm, so it's
got to be another kid.

321
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:38,572
Well, what about
that neighbor's boy?

322
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,164
Well, I checked him.
He didn't skip school

323
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:42,506
and went to basketball
practice afterwards.

324
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:46,411
Can we hold off on charging
Jeremy as an adult till we
get the story straight?

325
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:49,416
Well, he's 14,
so he's automatically
arraigned in Supreme Court.

326
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,384
But if you can prove to me
he wasn't the primary actor,

327
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:53,478
I will recommend he be
removed to Family Court.

328
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:55,250
Find out who
his friends are.

329
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:59,329
We're no strangers
to police inquiring
about some of our students,

330
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:02,161
but I am surprised to hear
you're investigating
Mr. Brice.

331
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,064
Jeremy's not a
troublemaker?

332
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:06,069
I don't know him,
so I guess not.

333
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:08,037
1,500 students, Detectives.

334
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:09,733
I only got time
for the bad eggs.

335
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:12,174
You're saying he's
a model student, then.

336
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:16,680
Academically, yes.
He does very well.
Especially in math and art.

337
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:21,412
But he was recently
diagnosed as dyslexic,
and according to his file,

338
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:25,252
his fifth grade teacher cited
social problems made him
repeat the year.

339
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:27,052
What kind of
social problems?

340
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,650
Well, I spoke with
Jeremy's teachers
this morning,

341
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:32,162
and he's a Iittle
behind maturity-wise.

342
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,061
He has some
trouble fitting in.

343
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:37,067
But again, nothing
to suggest any serious
discipline problems.

344
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:39,660
Teachers give you the names
of Jeremy's friends?

345
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:41,228
That's the thing,
no one knew.

346
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:42,898
Seems he really
doesn't have any.

347
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,845
We're going to need a Iist
of all the boys that were
absent the day of the murder,

348
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,278
and we're going to
need your permission
to search their Iockers.

349
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,052
I find any dead animals
in here, I'm going to
deputize you for this.

350
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,286
Got him.

351
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,452
What'd you find?

352
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:05,189
Susan Oestreicher.

353
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:10,191
(BELL RINGING)

354
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,099
And the weapon
that killed her.

355
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,230
PRINCIPAL CORRALES:
This is a surprise.

356
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:19,743
Locker 142 belongs
to Zachary Connor,
a sixth-grader.

357
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:23,176
I'II get his schedule
and we'II find him
in his next class.

358
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:25,409
I think he found
us already.

359
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:27,779
What happened
to my Iocker?

360
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,816
STABLER: Zachary Connor
is 12 years old.

361
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:36,759
I tell you, I've been on
this job a Iong time,
some things still surprise me.

362
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:38,557
You'II get over it.
His parents coming in?

363
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,393
They should
be here any minute.

364
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:42,729
We're going on 12 hours
holding Jeremy Brice.

365
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,598
He and his mother are
still in interrogation.

366
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:49,072
And they're staying until we
know his exact involvement
in this woman's death.

367
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,698
Munch is still
at the crime Iab.

368
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,300
CSU Iifted three
sets of prints off
of that knife.

369
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:56,609
One unknown,
one the victim's,
and one belonging to Jeremy.

370
00:17:56,681 --> 00:18:00,777
Captain, these are
Zachary Connor's parents.

371
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:02,945
Mr. and Mrs. Connor,
thank you for making it down.

372
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:05,649
Nobody's told us anything.
Is Zach all right?

373
00:18:05,723 --> 00:18:06,849
Well, he's fine. Fine.

374
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,359
We think he might know
something about a crime.

375
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:11,122
Now, Ted here
will get you settled,

376
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:13,858
and in a minute
a detective will
explain everything to you.

377
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,457
He's never been in
trouble before, Captain.
Not once.

378
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:23,798
Is that true?
No trouble with this boy?

379
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,207
Straight As.
Not a mark on
his school record.

380
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:28,973
Let's go easy on this.

381
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:31,311
Finesse them.
See if one turns
on the other.

382
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:32,872
Fin, you take
Zachary and his parents.

383
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:35,283
You guys take
another run at Jeremy.

384
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,947
Set up video cameras
and monitors in both rooms.

385
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:40,217
I'II call in Cabot
and Huang to observe.

386
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,053
FIN: Remember where
you were day before
yesterday, Zachary?

387
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,892
At school.
And then I went home.

388
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,795
You there all day?
Yeah.

389
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,094
Well, I talked
to your teachers,

390
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,136
and they said that you missed
all your classes after Iunch.

391
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:53,727
I was in the Iibrary.

392
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:56,134
I had to study
for a math test.

393
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:57,834
He does have
a big test coming up.

394
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,434
Okay. You know
Jeremy Brice?

395
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:01,706
He's a seventh-grader.

396
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:02,837
Friend of yours?

397
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:04,211
No. I don't
Iike him.

398
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:07,641
You didn't hang
out with him at all
day before yesterday?

399
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:10,187
No. He's dorky.
And he's a bully.

400
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:12,949
You got a knife, Zach?

401
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,116
A what?

402
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,659
You mean the one
in my Iocker.

403
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:18,320
FIN: Where'd you get it?

404
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:22,433
I found it in the dumpster
behind the school.
And the wallet, too.

405
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,525
What were you
Iooking for
in the garbage?

406
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:27,735
Well, sometimes they
throw out cool things.

407
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:29,568
Once I found
new markers.

408
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:30,972
Yeah, that is cool.

409
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:34,944
So why'd you take
the knife and wallet
and put them in your Iocker?

410
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,378
I was gonna
turn them in.

411
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:39,575
I thought someone Iost them.
But then I forgot.

412
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,380
Did you know there
was blood on that knife?

413
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:42,919
MRS. CONNOR: Oh, my God.

414
00:19:42,987 --> 00:19:44,955
I thought it was fake.

415
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,151
But you should ask Jeremy.
He told me where to find it.

416
00:19:49,594 --> 00:19:51,357
STABLER: So, Jeremy,
you want a drink?

417
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:52,862
No. I want to go home.

418
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:54,023
Well, I know you do.

419
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:57,226
But the reason that we have
to stay here is because you're
not telling us the truth.

420
00:19:57,302 --> 00:19:58,735
Yes, I am.

421
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:01,636
Jeremy, we picked up
your friend Zachary
at school today.

422
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,139
Zach's here?

423
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,302
He's right in the next room,
speaking to one
of our detectives.

424
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:09,646
What do you think
he's going to say?

425
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:12,444
Nothing.

426
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:15,043
I think he might.

427
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,818
Look, I know you don't want
to get him in trouble,

428
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,757
but you've got to
tell us what happened.

429
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:25,284
Even if it's something that's
really, really bad,
you've got to tell us.

430
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,831
Zach's my best friend.

431
00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:34,667
You can't make me say
he did something bad.

432
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,969
He didn't do anything.

433
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:41,436
Jeremy's in for
a rude awakening.

434
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:43,104
His best friend's
about to flip on him.

435
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:47,083
What I find hard to
believe is how a kid
as young as Zachary

436
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:48,846
is physically
capable of rape.

437
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,686
Biologically, all he needs
is enough testosterone
to achieve an erection.

438
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:55,726
These days,
boys reach puberty
as early as nine years old.

439
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:58,785
Add to that an ill woman,
weakened by chemotherapy.

440
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:01,832
She's the perfect victim
for a 90-pound rapist.

441
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:03,662
You think he did it?

442
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:06,326
I think he's Iying.

443
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:10,067
He keeps changing his story
so that it's just
plausible enough to be true.

444
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:11,631
He's involved.

445
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:15,938
What's all this?

446
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:17,572
Interrogation tactics,
Captain.

447
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,447
A few special mementos
from Zachary Connor's Iocker.

448
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,645
This is Detective Munch,
my partner.

449
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:26,485
MR. CONNOR: How much Ionger
do we need to be here?

450
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:28,388
Entirely up to your son,
Mr. Connor.

451
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,653
Is that your book?

452
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:31,888
I don't know.
AII our books
Iook alike.

453
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,124
Oh, yeah?
Is that your name?

454
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,393
Yeah.
Then that must
be yours, right?

455
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:41,666
What is this about?
It's his book.
Why does it matter?

456
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:45,641
We also have a CD
Iabeled with your initials,

457
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,942
a pen, a magazine subscription
sticker in your name.

458
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:52,005
You know where I got them?

459
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,448
In my Iocker at school?

460
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:56,180
Right. You know what else
they have in common? Hmm?

461
00:21:56,954 --> 00:21:58,251
Detective Tutuola?

462
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:00,257
Covered with
his fingerprints.

463
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:01,883
MUNCH: Correct.
Just a minute.

464
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,483
Now, Zach,
you're a bright young man.

465
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:06,530
You understand that every
time you touch something,

466
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:08,531
you Ieave a
fingerprint behind.

467
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,432
So I want you to think
real hard before you
answer this question.

468
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:15,404
Were you ever in
an apartment on Avenue C
where a woman was killed?

469
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,134
Oh, what the hell?

470
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,846
I was in that Iady's
apartment with Jeremy.

471
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,182
He killed her.

472
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:34,389
Hey, Jeremy,
I think you might
want to see this.

473
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:37,388
FIN: Whose idea was it?

474
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,427
Jeremy's.

475
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:43,024
FIN: To rob her
or to kill her?

476
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:44,800
ZACHARY: Everything.

477
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:47,766
He said she had
lots of money.

478
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:51,141
But then she came home.

479
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:55,443
He made me do
bad things to her.

480
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:57,344
He made me touch her.

481
00:22:58,683 --> 00:23:00,913
And then Jeremy got the knife

482
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,215
and he killed her.

483
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,216
FIN: What happened after that?

484
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,690
I ran away.

485
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:12,485
I was scared.

486
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,898
Jeremy. No.

487
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:20,199
Jeremy, is that
what happened?

488
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:21,761
He's Iying!

489
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,065
So you tell us the truth.

490
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:31,508
I didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

491
00:23:33,117 --> 00:23:35,950
Was it your idea to break
into that woman's apartment?

492
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,580
Jeremy, why would
you do that?

493
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:44,026
Zach thought it was cool.

494
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:46,996
STABLER: Was it cool when
you took the telephone
and bashed her head in?

495
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:50,329
I didn't do that, Zach did.

496
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,232
Do I Iisten to
his story or yours?

497
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:56,697
She fell down.

498
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:59,570
She was bleeding.

499
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:03,578
Zach said to get
a knife from the kitchen.

500
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:08,014
I didn't want to,
but he was screaming at me.

501
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:11,418
I didn't know what
he was going to do
with it, I swear.

502
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:15,585
So you got the knife,
and then what happened?

503
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:21,691
When I walked back in,
Zach was on top of her.

504
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:26,726
He took the knife
and he stabbed
her over and over.

505
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:29,898
There was all this
blood and I threw up!

506
00:24:29,974 --> 00:24:33,375
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry!

507
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:36,141
(SOBBING)

508
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:37,471
I'm sorry.

509
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:40,449
Jeremy, who covered her up
with the blanket?

510
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,614
I did.

511
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:47,684
You shouldn't Ieave
someone Iike that.

512
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,321
Can I go home now?

513
00:24:52,163 --> 00:24:54,097
I just want to go home.

514
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:57,094
I want to go home.

515
00:24:57,168 --> 00:25:00,365
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

516
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,943
CSU finished
with Zach's house?

517
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:10,003
Top to bottom. No blood.
Must have tossed the clothes
he was wearing.

518
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,810
So we've got two kids,
two different stories,

519
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:13,475
and either one of them
could have killed her.

520
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:15,849
Which means I have
an even bigger problem.

521
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,582
Whether or not to
try Jeremy Brice
as an adult.

522
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:20,146
Zachary Connor is 12.

523
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:23,022
So even if he acted alone,
he's out of my jurisdiction.

524
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:24,618
He is going
to Family Court.

525
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:27,061
And what kind of punishment
is kiddie court handing out

526
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:28,894
for rapists and murderers
these days?

527
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:31,298
Their mandate is
rehabilitation,
not punishment.

528
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:35,829
So the maximum
sentence is 18 months
in a Iimited secure facility.

529
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:38,000
And Jeremy's Iooking
at Iife in Attica.

530
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:40,942
If the D.A. thinks
he's a danger
to society, yes.

531
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:44,140
Okay, I got to tell you
that I believe Jeremy's
version of the events.

532
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:47,844
You know,
this kid is more of a danger
to himself than anybody else.

533
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,285
Doc, you saw both interviews.
What do you think?

534
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:51,946
I agree with you.

535
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:53,786
Jeremy is more
easily manipulated.

536
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:54,951
He's desperate to
fit in at any cost,

537
00:25:55,027 --> 00:25:57,587
whereas Zachary is
far more calculating.

538
00:25:57,663 --> 00:26:00,131
I think he wields
a great deal of control
over Jeremy,

539
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:03,599
and I think he
murdered and raped
Susan Oestreicher.

540
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:08,735
So the question is
do we go after Jeremy
because we can't get Zachary?

541
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,267
No.

542
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:15,304
I'II recommend
we remove Jeremy
to family court.

543
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:28,655
The D.A. is seeking
an indictment against
Jeremy Brice.

544
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:30,820
You've got one day
to prepare for
the grand jury.

545
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:32,523
On what charges?

546
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:34,122
Felony murder
and burglary one.

547
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:36,133
I recommended against it.

548
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,463
Well, the D.A. disagreed.

549
00:26:37,536 --> 00:26:41,939
But the evidence clearly
indicates that Jeremy Brice's
involvement was Iimited.

550
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:44,475
The DNA proves
that Zachary Connor
committed the rape.

551
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:47,706
Jeremy already confessed
to participating
in the burglary.

552
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:48,803
That's the predicate felony.

553
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,905
He knew it was dangerous,
he knew someone
could be killed.

554
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:52,473
No, he didn't.

555
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:55,179
This boy is not mature
enough to understand that.

556
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:57,050
The Iaw says he is.

557
00:26:57,122 --> 00:27:00,421
That Iegislation
was passed in 1978

558
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:03,859
as a knee-jerk reaction
to some perceived
youth crime wave.

559
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:06,523
It also says that
we prosecute
juveniles as adults

560
00:27:06,598 --> 00:27:09,499
at the discretion of
the district attorney.

561
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:12,002
He made the call.
You do your job.

562
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:15,037
Which should be easy enough
with Jeremy's confession.

563
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:18,141
A win for the D.A.

564
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,178
So that's what this is about.

565
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:21,974
'Cause I'd Iike to know just
how much of a sycophant

566
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:24,845
I have to be in this
new administration.

567
00:27:26,752 --> 00:27:28,549
Let's say you're right.

568
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,349
Let's say Zachary Connor
did everything.

569
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:33,914
That means every
step of the way,
Jeremy Brice had a choice.

570
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:36,686
Do the right thing
or do the wrong thing.

571
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:41,594
Watch your friend
rape a defenseless
woman or stop him,

572
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,602
run away or
give him the knife
so he can stab her to death.

573
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:47,402
Do we punish
him for this?

574
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:50,805
Or do we tell him that
there are no consequences
for his actions?

575
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:54,437
We remove him to Family Court
in hopes of rehabilitation.

576
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:58,373
That won't happen if he goes
J.O. and you know it.

577
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,749
You have more faith in
the Juvenile Justice
Department than I do.

578
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:09,087
You're adamantly opposed
to prosecuting this case?

579
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:11,925
Yes. I think it's wrong.

580
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:14,930
AII right.

581
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:17,459
Then I'II do it.

582
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:21,568
You're second chair.

583
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:30,877
EIizabeth Donnelly
is back trying cases?

584
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:34,146
Or did your new boss
demote you already?

585
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:37,916
Funny comments Iike that,
it's a wonder both
your Iegs aren't broken.

586
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:40,253
You get attacked
by one of your repeat
offenders again?

587
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:43,590
No, actually one of your
esteemed colleagues
knocked me off a curb.

588
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:45,152
There's a
Iaw suit pending.

589
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:49,056
AIexandra Cabot,
Gina Bernardo,
public defender.

590
00:28:49,134 --> 00:28:50,158
Nice to meet you.

591
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:54,433
So the D.A. has assembled
a Iegal dream team
to crucify a child.

592
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:56,838
You know as well as I do
charging Jeremy Brice

593
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:59,103
as an adult is
a gross injustice.

594
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:00,940
Tell that to
Susan Oestreicher's family.

595
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:04,413
You honestly believe
he deserves to be
charged for murder two?

596
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:06,314
The grand jury did.

597
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:09,319
You can't possibly hold
my client responsible
for something

598
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:12,481
it's impossible for him
to be responsible for.

599
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:15,586
Notification of
affirmative defense.

600
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,857
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

601
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:22,798
What defect?

602
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:26,235
His 14-year-old brain.

603
00:29:27,405 --> 00:29:28,929
DONNELLY: Your Honor,
this is an obvious attempt

604
00:29:29,007 --> 00:29:30,531
to backdoor
the defense of infancy.

605
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:34,773
Article 30 clearly states that
defense cannot be used for
juveniles charged with murder.

606
00:29:34,846 --> 00:29:38,304
I'm not saying that my
client isn't responsible
because of his age.

607
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:41,648
I am saying he isn't
responsible because
of his diminished capacity.

608
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,814
Dictated by his age.
It's the same thing.

609
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,381
This is a Iegislative issue,
Your Honor, not a matter
for the court.

610
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:51,054
Then why did three
Supreme Court justices
draft a public statement

611
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:53,689
calling for the abolishment
of juvenile executions?

612
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:57,963
Because it is cruel and
unusual to impose adult
punishment on someone

613
00:29:58,036 --> 00:29:59,901
who isn't capable
of adult thought.

614
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:02,166
Couldn't one argue then
that certain behavior,

615
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,540
such as the committing
of a violent crime,
proves adult thought?

616
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:09,978
No. If your 10-year-old
son takes your car
out for a joy ride,

617
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:12,380
do you automatically
hand him
a driver's Iicense?

618
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,042
This is all very interesting,
Ms. Bernardo,

619
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:17,350
but I fail to see
how any of this applies
to an insanity defense.

620
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:19,185
These are scientific studies

621
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:23,193
proving that an adolescent's
brain is significantly
different than an aduIt's.

622
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:27,129
That, in fact, our brains
aren't fully formed until
we're in our early 20s.

623
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:29,258
And I can present scientific
studies which prove

624
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:31,996
my cat is trying
to kill me in my sleep.

625
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,230
Daubert test, Your Honor.

626
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:36,741
Scientific evidence must meet
federal standards of relevance
and reliability.

627
00:30:36,808 --> 00:30:40,266
Well, one of the studies was
done by the National Institute
of Mental Health.

628
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:42,677
Is the federal government
reliable enough for you?

629
00:30:42,747 --> 00:30:45,944
The reliability
of the studies
isn't in question.

630
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:50,147
My job is to determine
whether or not they have
any material value.

631
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,883
I believe they do.

632
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:53,521
And I believe
the jury should hear them.

633
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:01,900
Dr. Hayman, can you
tell us about the study
you recently completed?

634
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:04,733
We used functional magnetic
resonance imaging

635
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:07,774
to map the brains of healthy
adolescents over several years

636
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,071
and compared them
to those of healthy adults.

637
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:12,202
And what did your study find?

638
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,806
For adolescents,
brain activity is much
higher in the amygdala,

639
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:19,011
which guides instincts
Iike fear or anger.

640
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,317
In adults, the activity
in the frontal
Iobe is higher,

641
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,620
and that's the seat
of reasoning and
good judgment.

642
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:28,661
BERNARDO: So what are
the conclusions of
your findings?

643
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:32,187
Adolescents are
physiologically prone

644
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,530
to impulsive and
irrational behavior.

645
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:41,006
So teenagers are moody
and unpredictable,
and even violent,

646
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,974
because they are
wired that way?

647
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:44,772
Objection. Leading.

648
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:46,210
Sustained.

649
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,680
That's all.
No further questions.

650
00:31:51,818 --> 00:31:58,690
So, your study says
that teenagers are
impulsive and irrational.

651
00:32:02,396 --> 00:32:04,796
Here's what
I don't understand.

652
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:08,858
If that's true,
how is it that
every single teenager

653
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:11,461
isn't a rapist or a murderer?

654
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:15,372
I believe I said
adolescents were prone
to certain behaviors.

655
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:19,378
Then some teenagers
are perfectly
reasonable and rational.

656
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:20,538
Yes.

657
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,510
How many?

658
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:25,442
How many what?

659
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,080
How many teenagers are
rational and how many are
rapists and murderers?

660
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:31,556
There's no answer
to that question.

661
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,092
I thought you
mapped their brains.

662
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,095
We haven't tested
every single teenager
in the world.

663
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:41,598
Oh. So if you had given MRIs
to every single teenager,

664
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,263
you would be able to predict
whether or not they would be
a criminal. Is that it?

665
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,136
No.
Well, what?

666
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:50,074
If the irrational
part of the brain
is overactive,

667
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:52,373
that proves that
they'II be violent,
doesn't it?

668
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:54,311
It doesn't
prove anything.

669
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:56,474
This research is
in its infancy.

670
00:32:57,384 --> 00:32:59,443
Your study doesn't
prove anything?

671
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,180
Not what you're
asking for, but...

672
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:04,087
Then it's a theory,
an unproven theory.

673
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:06,625
This research is
a huge step forward

674
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,285
in understanding
how the brain works.

675
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:12,093
Which is just another way
of saying we really don't
understand the brain at all.

676
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:16,760
Nothing further.

677
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,468
BERNARDO: Jeremy, do you know
the difference between
what's right and what's wrong?

678
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:26,403
Yes.

679
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,041
Was it wrong to break
into Susan Oestreicher's
apartment?

680
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,711
Yes.

681
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,585
Then why did you do it?

682
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:38,152
Zach said he
wanted some money.

683
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,022
Do you always do
what Zach wants?

684
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,991
He's my best friend.

685
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,089
Jeremy, did you know
that Zach was planning
to kill that woman?

686
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,258
JEREMY: No.

687
00:33:48,702 --> 00:33:51,136
And if you thought
even for one moment

688
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,899
that that's what
he wanted to do,

689
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:54,531
would you have gone
with him to the apartment,

690
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:56,735
even though he's
your best friend?

691
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,936
No.

692
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:01,072
I don't want
anyone to get killed.

693
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:03,048
BERNARDO: Jeremy,
what is more wrong?

694
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:07,382
Watching someone do something
terrible or telling on your
only friend?

695
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:13,492
I don't know.

696
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,262
So, maybe, you don't
know right from wrong
as much as you think.

697
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:23,129
Thank you, Jeremy.

698
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,470
Who hit Susan Oestreicher
over the head?

699
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,302
Zach.

700
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:34,507
Hard enough so she
was knocked out, right?

701
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:35,605
Yeah.

702
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:38,207
Then Zach told you
to get the knife.

703
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:42,246
He... He said to
Iook in the kitchen.

704
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:44,017
Did you think he
was going to stab her?

705
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,750
No.

706
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:47,817
What did you think
he was going to do?

707
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:52,055
Scare her.
He didn't want
her to yell.

708
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,930
But she wasn't awake.
How would she yell?

709
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,265
I don't know.

710
00:34:58,338 --> 00:35:00,636
What do people do
with knives, Jeremy?

711
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,441
Cut things.

712
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:08,379
So you walked
into the kitchen
and you got the knife.

713
00:35:08,448 --> 00:35:09,506
Yes.

714
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,375
You said you were
afraid of Zach. Why?

715
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:13,851
He was yelling at me.

716
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,320
Why didn't you
walk out the door?

717
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,794
I don't know.

718
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,857
So, you got the knife.

719
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:30,832
You walked back to Zach,

720
00:35:30,904 --> 00:35:33,873
and you were holding
the knife in your hands.

721
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,100
Yes.

722
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,904
Why did you
give it to him?

723
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:39,138
Was it because you were
afraid or because you

724
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:41,806
wanted to be
cool for your friend?

725
00:35:41,882 --> 00:35:42,940
I don't know!

726
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,109
You knew what he
was going to do,

727
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,551
and you helped him do it.
Isn't that why?

728
00:35:49,122 --> 00:35:50,589
I'm sorry!

729
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:52,319
I'm so sorry.

730
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:53,884
I'm so sorry.

731
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,793
I'm sorry.

732
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:57,863
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:57,933 --> 00:36:01,892
(JEREMY SOBBING)

734
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:07,666
Nothing further.

735
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:12,507
I'm so sorry.

736
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:21,951
AIex.

737
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:25,750
Well, guess you got
what you wanted.

738
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:30,763
Destroying a child on
the stand is not quite
the highlight of my career.

739
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:33,458
You did your job.

740
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:34,627
Careful, AIex.

741
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:38,799
You're beginning to sound
Iike me, disillusioned
before your time.

742
00:36:40,475 --> 00:36:42,636
I need you to subpoena
a rebuttal witness.

743
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:43,973
Who?
Zachary Connor.

744
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:45,138
Why?

745
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:47,512
As of today,
he's been adjudicated
by Family Court.

746
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:51,144
Any testimony he gives
won't be tainted
by his co-conspirator status.

747
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,710
If you put Zachary Connor
on the stand,

748
00:36:52,788 --> 00:36:55,757
he's going to say that
Jeremy did everything and
I believe that's a Iie.

749
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:58,657
I'm not putting him
on the stand. You are.

750
00:36:58,727 --> 00:37:01,491
Jury already thinks
I make Iittle kids cry.

751
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:03,428
No. I won't
suborn perjury.

752
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:06,365
Then I guess you
better make sure
he tells the truth.

753
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:17,404
CABOT: Zachary,
who killed Susan Oestreicher?

754
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:19,878
Jeremy did.

755
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:22,311
So he stabbed
her with a knife?

756
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:23,681
Yes.

757
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:26,277
That must have been
very frightening for you.

758
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:28,186
Yes. I was scared.

759
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:29,986
What were you scared of?

760
00:37:30,058 --> 00:37:31,252
Jeremy.

761
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:32,851
Why?

762
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:35,158
Because he's bigger.

763
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:38,090
Was Jeremy
afraid of anything?

764
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,224
Yes.

765
00:37:39,668 --> 00:37:40,760
What?

766
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:43,470
He was just afraid.
He didn't want to get caught.

767
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:45,096
But you did get caught.

768
00:37:45,173 --> 00:37:46,663
Miss Oestreicher came home.

769
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:49,575
That was Jeremy's fault.
He got it wrong.

770
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,276
You must have been really
scared when she walked in
that door?

771
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:53,814
No, I wasn't.

772
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:54,940
Okay.

773
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:58,849
Zachary, when did
you throw up?

774
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:00,847
That was Jeremy.

775
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:03,288
I thought you
were afraid, Zachary.

776
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,384
I thought you threw up
because you couldn't
Iook at the blood.

777
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,929
I could, too.
Jeremy couldn't.

778
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,760
He was being a baby
and crying.

779
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:13,164
When? Before or after
she was killed?

780
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:14,395
The whole time.

781
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:16,699
And you weren't crying?
Not even just a Iittle?

782
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:17,864
No.

783
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:19,372
But I thought you
were afraid, Zachary.

784
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:21,705
I thought you were
afraid of Jeremy.

785
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:22,971
No, I wasn't.

786
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:26,208
And you were also afraid
of that woman because she
was going to call the police.

787
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:27,339
She was afraid of me.

788
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:29,884
And you wanted to show
them both that you were a man,

789
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:31,350
and that's why you
had sex with her.

790
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,480
Well, that was her fault
because she wouldn't tell
me where the money was.

791
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:37,787
Jeremy was crying!
He wouldn't do anything
so I had to do it!

792
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,226
If she had just told me where
the money was, I wouldn't have
had to hurt her!

793
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:45,958
Nothing further.

794
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:57,805
Five to 10 years.

795
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:00,540
He wouldn't get out
until he was 24?

796
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:03,743
It's the minimum sentence.
With good behavior,
he's out in five.

797
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:06,913
But if they say not guilty,
he won't go to jail at all.

798
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:11,448
The jury will not say that.
The Iaw is very clear.

799
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:13,494
Jeremy already admitted
to being in the apartment

800
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:16,463
with the intent to burglarize
it and someone was killed.

801
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:19,866
He can still be found
guilty of felony murder.

802
00:39:19,935 --> 00:39:22,529
You want me to tell you
to send my son to jail.

803
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:25,368
Why don't we take a day
to think about this?

804
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,465
No. I don't need
to think about it.

805
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:30,739
The answer is no.
He didn't hurt anyone.

806
00:39:30,812 --> 00:39:36,250
Mrs. Brice, if Jeremy is
convicted, he is facing
a possible Iife sentence.

807
00:39:38,987 --> 00:39:42,787
Miss Bernardo, please tell
your client's mother how
rare jury nullification is.

808
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,485
We should take the deal.

809
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,524
I don't Iike taking
chances with the jury.

810
00:39:48,296 --> 00:39:49,354
They heard that other boy.

811
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:53,094
They know Jeremy is good,
and they won't
send him to jail.

812
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:54,965
No.

813
00:39:55,537 --> 00:39:56,765
No deal.

814
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:08,478
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

815
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,313

817

We find the defendant guilty.

818
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:18,859
No!

819
00:40:22,097 --> 00:40:25,897
RIDENOUR: On the second count,
burglary in the first degree,
how do you find?

We find
the defendant guilty.

821
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:34,432
Poll the jury, Your Honor.

822
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:37,205

827

829
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:51,584

831
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:54,521

Juror number six?

833
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:57,226
Guilty.

834
00:40:57,299 --> 00:40:59,392
Juror number seven?

835
00:40:59,468 --> 00:41:00,696
Guilty.
