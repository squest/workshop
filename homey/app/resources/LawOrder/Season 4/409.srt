1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:00,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:05,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:09,872
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:13,607
are members
of an elite squad known as
the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,649
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:21,219
Yeah. Okay, thanks.
Come on.

8
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,457
Go, go, go!

9
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:41,063
Police! NYPD!
We have a search warrant!

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,534
What the hell?

11
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,611
Somebody got here
before us.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,308
Secure it.
I don't want
any surprises.

13
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,313
OFFICER 1: Too Iate.

14
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,124
I better call in SVU.

15
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,929
We are not handing
this bust over to them.

16
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,591
Don't worry.
I got a buddy.

17
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,729
FIN: Better be good.

18
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,829
Anonymous phone tip
said somebody was dealing.

19
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,398
We surveilled a week,
caught a Iot of traffic
in and out of this place.

20
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:20,846
Get our warrant, bust in,
find our alleged
dealer sliced and diced.

21
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:24,407
Signs of burglary, and by her
appearance I'm guessing she's
been raped, too.

22
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:28,888
But, you know, I wanted
a trained SVU detective
Iike yourself on the case.

23
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,481
Rape-homicide falls
on SVU no matter what.

24
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,084
You didn't have to
hand it to me personally.

25
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,994
There's a big haul here.
Looks good for my guys
to turn it in.

26
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,465
Yeah, right.
You get all the glory
and we get all the work.

27
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:44,937
So you trying to tell me
that Laura Ashley here
is some kind of big kingpin?

28
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,472
Where are the drugs?

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,098
You didn't get
the complete tour.

30
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,011
Over two hundred plants.

31
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,386
Pull in a couple
of hundred thou
on the street.

32
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,260
Perp missed the jackpot.

33
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,838
M.E. estimates TOD
yesterday between
9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.

34
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,439
Looked Iike about
30 to 40 stab wounds.

35
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,778
Overkill.

36
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,284
He either knew her
well enough to hate her
or he's psychotic.

37
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,117
Point of entry Iooks Iike
the fire escape window.

38
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,055
Perp probably waltzed
out the front door.

39
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,559
Got minimal fluids
from the rape kit,
but enough to test.

40
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,753
You Iocate a
murder weapon?

41
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,886
Must've taken
it with him.

42
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,931
Three-inch, single-edged,
non-serrated blade.

43
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,125
About the size of the knife
missing from this?

44
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,396
Yeah. The other
weapon he Ieft behind.

45
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,165
Bashed in the back of her
head before he stabbed her.

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,868
Probably enough
to knock her out.
No defensive wounds.

47
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,309
It's not the most
obvious weapon.

48
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,278
So she surprises him.

49
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,079
Probably picked up
the first thing
he could grab.

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,449
Then he walks all the way
across the apartment
for a knife?

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,953
This guy's Iogic is
all over the place.

52
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,046
Maybe he's mentally ill.
Or high.

53
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,785
LAYTON: He covered
Mrs. Oestreicher with this.

54
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,159
By the amount of blood on
the blanket, I'd say right
after he stabbed her.

55
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:54,258
So afterwards
he gets remorseful,
embarrassed?

56
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,825
And then sick.

57
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,532
Our guy must
have thrown up.

58
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,636
It's too far away
to be the victim's.

59
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,972
Okay, Iet's send
a sample to the M.E.

60
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,808
We can compare it to
the stomach contents of our
victim, just to be sure.

61
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,938
LAYTON: I Iove my job.

62
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,482
What do we know about
this anonymous phone tip?

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,040
Narcotics traced
it to a neighbor.

64
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,382
Said she's nosy,
but not homicidal.

65
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,854
I thought anonymous
tip meant anonymous.

66
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,084
Like nobody would
bug you about doing
your civic duty.

67
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,625
We certainly don't mean
to inconvenience you.

68
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,355
But there was a woman
murdered in your building.

69
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,987
I know. I'm sorry
about that.

70
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,692
But you Iive
that kind of Iife,
you're asking for it.

71
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,359
And what kind
of Iife is that?

72
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,427
Criminal. You should've
been here when she was
sparking up.

73
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,802
Just walking down
the hall you'd get a buzz.

74
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,898
Marc, get in there
and brush those teeth now.

75
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,670
So you reported
Mrs. Oestreicher

76
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:40,510
as a drug dealer
because you smelled dope.
That was the only reason?

77
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,879
What about the daily
Easter parade?

78
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,182
In and out of there,
people banging on the door
all hours of the day.

79
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:51,088
Did you ever actually
see any of these deals,
any money changing hands?

80
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:55,026
No. No, but if she wasn't
selling, I don't know where
she got her money.

81
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,620
She hasn't worked
a day in over a year.

82
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,097
Autopsy's done.

83
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,794
So are the preliminary
Iabs on the fluids from
the rape kit.

84
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,302
Anything interesting?

85
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,735
Your perp had no sperm.

86
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,796
Interesting and pathetic.

87
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:10,537
I'm not talking
Iow sperm count.
This is azoospermia.

88
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,876
Zero sperm in the ejaculate.
It's pretty rare.

89
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,744
So our guy
got a vasectomy.

90
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,579
That's one
explanation for it.

91
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,451
It's also a sign of
Kartagener's Syndrome
and Cystic Fibrosis.

92
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,787
The Iab can still extract
DNA from the skin
cells in the sample.

93
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,382
And they're
analyzing the vomit.

94
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,927
We know who puked?

95
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,522
Victim hadn't eaten
in hours, so it had to
come from your perp.

96
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,532
As far as Miss Oestreicher
is concerned,

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,626
I suspect she would have died
within the year, had she not
been murdered.

98
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:37,932
What was
wrong with her?

99
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,905
Advanced
ovarian cancer.

100
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,806
She has small radiation burns
on the skin of her abdomen,

101
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,436
and blood tests reveal
Taxol and carboplatin.

102
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,070
She was undergoing
chemotherapy.

103
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,047
That explains why
she didn't have a job.

104
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,084
And why she was
growing pot.

105
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,211
Must have been using it
to counteract the side effects
of the cancer treatment.

106
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,654
Decent Ievels of
THC in her system.

107
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,521
But that woman was growing
a forest in there.

108
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,560
You think she was
toking on all that
by herself?

109
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,651
Maybe she wasn't.

110
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,254
You know, medicinal
marijuana clubs are
popping up everywhere.

111
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,698
People are pooling their
resources, growing their
own stuff.

112
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,929
Better product without
having to pay street prices.

113
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,938
Well, if she's running a club,
then there has to be
a membership Iist.

114
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,801
How many people
we Iooking at?

115
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,574
According to her
day planner,
nearly 100.

116
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,047
But there's no names.
She only writes initials.

117
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:26,177
We got C.K. down
the second Monday
of every month.

118
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,016
J.A.S. every
other Saturday.

119
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,648
Probably a schedule.
Members take turns
tending the crop.

120
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,282
Why the hell you
know so much about it?

121
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,522
Twenty-five years on the job
and he's still a damn hippie.

122
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,259
Okay, I got the phone dumps
from Susan Oestreicher
for the past six months.

123
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,029
We got to match the names
with the initials and weed
out the potheads.

124
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,263
Find one club member,
might Iead us to the rest.

125
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,034
Convincing somebody
to turn over that Iist
is not going to be easy.

126
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,770
People Iooking at
a narcotics rap tend
to be real cooperative.

127
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,142
Threatening cancer patients.
Now, that's why
I became a cop.

128
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,046
They're breaking the Iaw.
I don't care how sick
they are.

129
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:59,517
Do you have any idea
why cannabis is
illegal in this country?

130
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,486
Because William Randolph
Hearst's paper mills

131
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,954
were threatened by
the hemp industry.

132
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,389
And that's got nothing
to do with the fact that
it's a drug.

133
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,949
What do you call
alcohol and tobacco?

134
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,460
Legal.

135
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,791
Here we go.

136
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,195
For the initials C.K.,
we've got a Cindy Kerber.

137
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:17,795
C.K. C.K. Charles Kelsey,
Christian Kessler.
This is going to be fun.

138
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,997
We'II run them all down.

139
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,939
If they had access
to the victim,
they're all suspects.

140
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,437
STABLER: We know about
your club, Miss Kerber.

141
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,505
Then I assume you found
what we were growing.

142
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,778
Pretty tough to miss.
You guys have
very green thumbs.

143
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,252
We're not hurting
anyone and we're
not making a profit.

144
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,221
We are investigating
a murder.

145
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,157
Now, all we need
are the other names
of the members in the club.

146
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,023
The rest is between us.

147
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,562
I don't know most of
the people involved.
We don't socialize.

148
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,291
Give us the names
of the people
you do know.

149
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,094
I'm sorry. I can't.

150
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,794
This woman
was raped.

151
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,427
She was stabbed
38 times.

152
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:54,031
You don't want to help us
in our investigation?
That is very strange to me.

153
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,098
Because it wasn't
anyone in the club.

154
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:00,078
Some of these people were
debilitated from nausea,
from chemotherapy.

155
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:04,846
The only thing that controls
my tremors from M.S.
is smoking once in a while.

156
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,943
Why would we kill the woman
who was helping us?

157
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,750
Maybe she was
helping the wrong person.

158
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,883
Somebody's sick,
doesn't make
them an angel.

159
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,693
There was some trouble
with this one woman, Becky.
Not her, really. Her husband.

160
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,698
What kind of trouble?

161
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:24,328
He threatened Sue.
Said she hooked
his wife on drugs.

162
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,872
Becky was dying
from metastatic
breast cancer,

163
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,340
and he wouldn't allow her
the tiniest bit of relief.

164
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,377
Well, do you think
that he's capable
of murder?

165
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,106
I know his own wife
was afraid of him.

166
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,776
Especially after he broke
some guy's back in a bar
fight. Went to jail for it.

167
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,284
I wouldn't
touch that bitch.

168
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,914
Isn't it refreshing to hear
such militant adherence to
the "Just Say No" philosophy?

169
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,014
It's so rare
in convicts.

170
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,786
That incident
was an accident.

171
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,420
I did five years inside,
and now my wife's dead.

172
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,760
I paid the price.
Go bother somebody else.

173
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,265
No, we're bothering you,
Mr. Paglione.

174
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,063
You got an awful Iot of hate
for the woman who was trying
to comfort your wife.

175
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,865
Yeah, that's a real
beautiful story.

176
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:01,897
Until one of you comes to my
house and finds drugs and
busts me for parole violation.

177
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,776
I was working from
6:00 in the morning
to 4:00, and no Iunch break.

178
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,674
And that's all I'm saying.

179
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,787
BENSON: We'II see you
back at the house.

180
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,716
Munch says the husband's
alibi checks out.

181
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,318
This membership Iist
is getting smaller.

182
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,660
Half these people
are either dead or too
weak to get out of bed.

183
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,325
Maybe we're going
down the wrong path
with this pot club.

184
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,602
No, I just can't buy that
the murder and the drugs
are a coincidence.

185
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,540
Susan Oestreicher's neighbor
thought she was a drug dealer.

186
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,440
What if somebody
else thought so, too?

187
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,011
An M.E. out of the morgue?
Must be big.

188
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,912
Captain Cragen told me
you were here.

189
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,975
Lab finished analyzing
the vomit from
the crime scene.

190
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,681
Hey, am I gonna
want to stop eating
before I hear this?

191
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:53,419
Pieces of roast beef,
a Iittle mozzarella cheese,
kernels of corn and raisins.

192
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,461
Luckily, they hadn't been
in the stomach very Iong,

193
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,326
so everything was
only partially digested.

194
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,160
Yeah, I'm done.

195
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,598
And this is
good news because?

196
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,568
My daughter's in
the sixth grade.

197
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:07,664
She had that exact
meal for Iunch at school
on the day of the murder.

198
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,199
I've got the menu
on the fridge.
I called the Board of Ed.

199
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,736
Every middle school
in Manhattan serves
the same Iunch.

200
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,007
No sperm in the ejaculate.

201
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,455
We're Iooking for a kid.

202
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,649
Are we buying in to
this juvenile theory?

203
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,194
Well, it makes sense.

204
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,628
The disorganization of
the crime scene indicates
an immature thought process.

205
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,895
The number of stab wounds
could mean he has no real
understanding of physiology.

206
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,528
He just kills
the way he thinks that
you're supposed to kill.

207
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,731
The rape. Sexual curiosity.

208
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,331
Well, we know the kid went
to school that day Iong
enough to have Iunch,

209
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,240
so he must've
cut out afterwards.

210
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,109
Well, we're not canvassing
every junior high in the city,

211
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,549
and I'm not waiting for a DNA
analysis of the puke,
so Iet's hear suggestions.

212
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:55,281
Okay, we're Iooking for
a boy who has a history
of fights in school.

213
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,983
Minor vandalism with
risk-taking behavior.

214
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,491
Sounds Iike every
teenage boy on the planet.

215
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,925
I know.
It's not much
to go on.

216
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,520
But adolescent behavior
is inherently unpredictable.

217
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,566
That's why mental
health care professionals

218
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,830
won't Iabel a child
a sociopath even if
he fits the definition.

219
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,565
So the profile's wide open.
What else?

220
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,163
Juvies stay
with the familiar.

221
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,232
Maybe the victim
knew this kid.

222
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,004
And even if she didn't,
he's Iikely to commit

223
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,807
the crimes in his
own comfort zone.

224
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,939
The neighbor
who phoned in
the tip to Narcotics.

225
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,505
Her son Iooked
about 13, right?

226
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:29,021
That was Mrs. Lesinski
and her son Marc.

227
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,955
Maybe he Iistens to Mom
rail about the drug
dealer down the hall,

228
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,687
he figures he can get
himself some free dope.

229
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,787
And get some cash
for a new Xbox
while he's at it.

230
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,354
Check him out.

231
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,530
Look, I told you,
Marc didn't see who
killed her.

232
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,035
He was in school.

233
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,230
You're sure about that?

234
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,363
Of course I am.

235
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,738
And the school calls
if he skips class?

236
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,174
What exactly
are you asking?

237
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,677
Mrs. Lesinski,
we need to speak
with Marc right now.

238
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,008
You think he could
have done this?

239
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,015
He is a child.
Are you crazy?

240
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,241
Has Marc bought anything
that he doesn't have
the money for?

241
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,309
No.

242
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,447
Have you seen him with...

243
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,923
Seen him with anything
expensive that you
didn't give him?

244
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,757
He said it was
a present from
a friend.

245
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,559
STABLER: Come on over here.
Show it to us, will you?

246
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,793
An MP3 player.

247
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,131
Must be a very good friend
to be so generous.

248
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,700
No, the kid's a total geek.
He's always giving stuff
to people.

249
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,575
Oh. This total geek
have a name?

250
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,409
Jeremy Brice.

251
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,074
STABLER: Mmm-hmm. Where do
you think Jeremy got that?

252
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,619
Did you tell him that you
had a drug dealer Iiving
down the hall from you?

253
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:35,814
Yeah.
What'd you say?

254
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,887
I said that she's probably
got some pretty cool stuff,
you know, 'cause she deals.

255
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,624
BENSON: So don't you think
it's possible that he got it
from Mrs. Oestreicher's place?

256
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,290
I don't know, maybe.

257
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,266
But there's no way
Jeremy killed her.

258
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,165
Well, how do you
know that?

259
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,899
He's just not that cool.

260
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,201
(DOOR BELL RINGING)

261
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,573
It is almost 8:00.
Everybody's already Ieft.

262
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,669
Let's pull him
out of school.

263
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:04,177
Liv. Liv.
Kids waiting
for the bus.

264
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,856
Hi, guys.
Anyone know
Jeremy Brice?

265
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,051
Who?

266
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,150
Jeremy Brice.

267
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,285
There.

268
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,730
You Jeremy?

269
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,665
Relax, relax,
relax, Jeremy.

270
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:22,861
I didn't do anything!

271
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,131
We're the police.
We want to talk to you.
Just relax.

272
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,663
Jeremy, that Iooks
Iike blood.

273
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,972
No, it isn't.

274
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,569
We're going down to
the police station,
Jeremy, all right?

275
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,773
Where are
your parents?

276
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,713
I have to go to school.
I have to...

277
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,616
You made a mistake.
Jeremy was in school all day.

278
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,815
We checked, Mrs. Brice.

279
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,018
Jeremy's teachers told
us that he was absent
after Iunch.

280
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,458
You skipped school?

281
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,756
No.

282
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,129
Jeremy? Jeremy,
Iook at me a second.

283
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,496
You know you're
not supposed to Iie
to the police, right?

284
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,628
I'm not Iying.

285
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,468
STABLER: Where'd you get
the MP3 player you gave
to your buddy Marc?

286
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,409
I gave him that
for his birthday.

287
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,648
Do you know a Iady named
Susan Oestreicher?

288
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,809
No.

289
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:15,377
You sure? She's the woman that
Iives right next door to Marc.

290
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,855
Jeremy, you went
into that apartment,

291
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,085
and something bad
happened there,
didn't it?

292
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,923
I didn't go anywhere.

293
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,954
Jeremy, these are your
fingerprints that your mom
Iet us take when you got here.

294
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,358
Remember that?

295
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,363
These are the ones
that we found in
Miss Oestreicher's apartment.

296
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,141
They're exactly the same.

297
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,509
No, they're not.

298
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,380
STABLER: They are.
This tells me you
were in that apartment.

299
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,816
No, it doesn't.

300
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,252
Jeremy, what happened?

301
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:51,950
Nothing. Why is
everybody picking on me?

302
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,819
We'II take another crack
at him once he calms down.

303
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,558
Well, we know he
was in the apartment.

304
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,760
Once the Iabs come back on
the forensic evidence,
we won't need a confession.

305
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:02,927
A typical kid.

306
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,301
Thinks if he denies
everything,
it'II just go away.

307
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,535
He's 14. EIigible to
be tried as an adult.

308
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,805
Murder two.
Would've been
eligible if he was 13.

309
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,368
He Iook Iike
a grownup to you?

310
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,415
He brutally
raped and murdered
a 34-year-old woman.

311
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,507
That's a grownup crime.

312
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,280
He's not crying
for his victim,
he's crying for himself.

313
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,344
Guess you can't blame him.
His Iife is over.

314
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,791
Labs are back.
BIood on Jeremy's coat
matched the victim's type.

315
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,418
Sounds Iike your
job is done.

316
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,723
No. We're not that Iucky.

317
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,594
Lab's determined
that the rapist's
blood was a type B.

318
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,759
I got Jeremy's from
his school. He's type O.

319
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,597
He had a partner.
Yeah.

320
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,570
No sperm, so it's
got to be another kid.

321
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,572
Well, what about
that neighbor's boy?

322
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,164
Well, I checked him.
He didn't skip school

323
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,506
and went to basketball
practice afterwards.

324
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:48,411
Can we hold off on charging
Jeremy as an adult till we
get the story straight?

325
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,416
Well, he's 14,
so he's automatically
arraigned in Supreme Court.

326
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,384
But if you can prove to me
he wasn't the primary actor,

327
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,478
I will recommend he be
removed to Family Court.

328
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,250
Find out who
his friends are.

329
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,329
We're no strangers
to police inquiring
about some of our students,

330
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:06,161
but I am surprised to hear
you're investigating
Mr. Brice.

331
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,064
Jeremy's not a
troublemaker?

332
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,069
I don't know him,
so I guess not.

333
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,037
1,500 students, Detectives.

334
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,733
I only got time
for the bad eggs.

335
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,174
You're saying he's
a model student, then.

336
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:20,680
Academically, yes.
He does very well.
Especially in math and art.

337
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:25,412
But he was recently
diagnosed as dyslexic,
and according to his file,

338
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:29,252
his fifth grade teacher cited
social problems made him
repeat the year.

339
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,052
What kind of
social problems?

340
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,650
Well, I spoke with
Jeremy's teachers
this morning,

341
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:36,162
and he's a Iittle
behind maturity-wise.

342
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,061
He has some
trouble fitting in.

343
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:41,067
But again, nothing
to suggest any serious
discipline problems.

344
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:43,660
Teachers give you the names
of Jeremy's friends?

345
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,228
That's the thing,
no one knew.

346
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,898
Seems he really
doesn't have any.

347
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:51,845
We're going to need a Iist
of all the boys that were
absent the day of the murder,

348
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:54,278
and we're going to
need your permission
to search their Iockers.

349
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,052
I find any dead animals
in here, I'm going to
deputize you for this.

350
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,286
Got him.

351
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,452
What'd you find?

352
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,189
Susan Oestreicher.

353
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,191
(BELL RINGING)

354
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,099
And the weapon
that killed her.

355
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,230
PRINCIPAL CORRALES:
This is a surprise.

356
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:23,743
Locker 142 belongs
to Zachary Connor,
a sixth-grader.

357
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:27,176
I'II get his schedule
and we'II find him
in his next class.

358
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:29,409
I think he found
us already.

359
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,779
What happened
to my Iocker?

360
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,816
STABLER: Zachary Connor
is 12 years old.

361
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,759
I tell you, I've been on
this job a Iong time,
some things still surprise me.

362
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,557
You'II get over it.
His parents coming in?

363
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,393
They should
be here any minute.

364
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:46,729
We're going on 12 hours
holding Jeremy Brice.

365
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:48,598
He and his mother are
still in interrogation.

366
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:53,072
And they're staying until we
know his exact involvement
in this woman's death.

367
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,698
Munch is still
at the crime Iab.

368
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:57,300
CSU Iifted three
sets of prints off
of that knife.

369
00:17:57,378 --> 00:18:00,609
One unknown,
one the victim's,
and one belonging to Jeremy.

370
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:04,777
Captain, these are
Zachary Connor's parents.

371
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:06,945
Mr. and Mrs. Connor,
thank you for making it down.

372
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,649
Nobody's told us anything.
Is Zach all right?

373
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:10,849
Well, he's fine. Fine.

374
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:13,359
We think he might know
something about a crime.

375
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,122
Now, Ted here
will get you settled,

376
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:17,858
and in a minute
a detective will
explain everything to you.

377
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,457
He's never been in
trouble before, Captain.
Not once.

378
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:27,798
Is that true?
No trouble with this boy?

379
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,207
Straight As.
Not a mark on
his school record.

380
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:32,973
Let's go easy on this.

381
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,311
Finesse them.
See if one turns
on the other.

382
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,872
Fin, you take
Zachary and his parents.

383
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,283
You guys take
another run at Jeremy.

384
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,947
Set up video cameras
and monitors in both rooms.

385
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:44,217
I'II call in Cabot
and Huang to observe.

386
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:48,053
FIN: Remember where
you were day before
yesterday, Zachary?

387
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:49,892
At school.
And then I went home.

388
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,795
You there all day?
Yeah.

389
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,094
Well, I talked
to your teachers,

390
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:56,136
and they said that you missed
all your classes after Iunch.

391
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,727
I was in the Iibrary.

392
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,134
I had to study
for a math test.

393
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,834
He does have
a big test coming up.

394
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:04,434
Okay. You know
Jeremy Brice?

395
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:05,706
He's a seventh-grader.

396
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,837
Friend of yours?

397
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:08,211
No. I don't
Iike him.

398
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,641
You didn't hang
out with him at all
day before yesterday?

399
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,187
No. He's dorky.
And he's a bully.

400
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:16,949
You got a knife, Zach?

401
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:18,116
A what?

402
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,659
You mean the one
in my Iocker.

403
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,320
FIN: Where'd you get it?

404
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:26,433
I found it in the dumpster
behind the school.
And the wallet, too.

405
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,525
What were you
Iooking for
in the garbage?

406
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:31,735
Well, sometimes they
throw out cool things.

407
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,568
Once I found
new markers.

408
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:34,972
Yeah, that is cool.

409
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:38,944
So why'd you take
the knife and wallet
and put them in your Iocker?

410
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:40,378
I was gonna
turn them in.

411
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,575
I thought someone Iost them.
But then I forgot.

412
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:45,380
Did you know there
was blood on that knife?

413
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:46,919
MRS. CONNOR: Oh, my God.

414
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,955
I thought it was fake.

415
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:52,151
But you should ask Jeremy.
He told me where to find it.

416
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,357
STABLER: So, Jeremy,
you want a drink?

417
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:56,862
No. I want to go home.

418
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,023
Well, I know you do.

419
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:01,226
But the reason that we have
to stay here is because you're
not telling us the truth.

420
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:02,735
Yes, I am.

421
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,636
Jeremy, we picked up
your friend Zachary
at school today.

422
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,139
Zach's here?

423
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,302
He's right in the next room,
speaking to one
of our detectives.

424
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,646
What do you think
he's going to say?

425
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:16,444
Nothing.

426
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,043
I think he might.

427
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,818
Look, I know you don't want
to get him in trouble,

428
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,757
but you've got to
tell us what happened.

429
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:29,284
Even if it's something that's
really, really bad,
you've got to tell us.

430
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,831
Zach's my best friend.

431
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,667
You can't make me say
he did something bad.

432
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,969
He didn't do anything.

433
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:45,436
Jeremy's in for
a rude awakening.

434
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,104
His best friend's
about to flip on him.

435
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:51,083
What I find hard to
believe is how a kid
as young as Zachary

436
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,846
is physically
capable of rape.

437
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,686
Biologically, all he needs
is enough testosterone
to achieve an erection.

438
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,726
These days,
boys reach puberty
as early as nine years old.

439
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:02,785
Add to that an ill woman,
weakened by chemotherapy.

440
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,832
She's the perfect victim
for a 90-pound rapist.

441
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,662
You think he did it?

442
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,326
I think he's Iying.

443
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:14,067
He keeps changing his story
so that it's just
plausible enough to be true.

444
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:15,631
He's involved.

445
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:19,938
What's all this?

446
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:21,572
Interrogation tactics,
Captain.

447
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:24,447
A few special mementos
from Zachary Connor's Iocker.

448
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,645
This is Detective Munch,
my partner.

449
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,485
MR. CONNOR: How much Ionger
do we need to be here?

450
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:32,388
Entirely up to your son,
Mr. Connor.

451
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,653
Is that your book?

452
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,888
I don't know.
AII our books
Iook alike.

453
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,124
Oh, yeah?
Is that your name?

454
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,393
Yeah.
Then that must
be yours, right?

455
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:45,666
What is this about?
It's his book.
Why does it matter?

456
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,641
We also have a CD
Iabeled with your initials,

457
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,942
a pen, a magazine subscription
sticker in your name.

458
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:56,005
You know where I got them?

459
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,448
In my Iocker at school?

460
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:00,180
Right. You know what else
they have in common? Hmm?

461
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,251
Detective Tutuola?

462
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,257
Covered with
his fingerprints.

463
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:05,883
MUNCH: Correct.
Just a minute.

464
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,483
Now, Zach,
you're a bright young man.

465
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:10,530
You understand that every
time you touch something,

466
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,531
you Ieave a
fingerprint behind.

467
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,432
So I want you to think
real hard before you
answer this question.

468
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:19,404
Were you ever in
an apartment on Avenue C
where a woman was killed?

469
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:21,134
Oh, what the hell?

470
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,846
I was in that Iady's
apartment with Jeremy.

471
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:31,182
He killed her.

472
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:38,389
Hey, Jeremy,
I think you might
want to see this.

473
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,388
FIN: Whose idea was it?

474
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,427
Jeremy's.

475
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:47,024
FIN: To rob her
or to kill her?

476
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:48,800
ZACHARY: Everything.

477
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,766
He said she had
lots of money.

478
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,141
But then she came home.

479
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:59,443
He made me do
bad things to her.

480
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,344
He made me touch her.

481
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,913
And then Jeremy got the knife

482
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,215
and he killed her.

483
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,216
FIN: What happened after that?

484
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,690
I ran away.

485
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,485
I was scared.

486
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,898
Jeremy. No.

487
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,199
Jeremy, is that
what happened?

488
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:25,761
He's Iying!

489
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,065
So you tell us the truth.

490
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:35,508
I didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

491
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:39,950
Was it your idea to break
into that woman's apartment?

492
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,580
Jeremy, why would
you do that?

493
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,026
Zach thought it was cool.

494
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,996
STABLER: Was it cool when
you took the telephone
and bashed her head in?

495
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:54,329
I didn't do that, Zach did.

496
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,232
Do I Iisten to
his story or yours?

497
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,697
She fell down.

498
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,570
She was bleeding.

499
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:07,578
Zach said to get
a knife from the kitchen.

500
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:12,014
I didn't want to,
but he was screaming at me.

501
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,418
I didn't know what
he was going to do
with it, I swear.

502
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:19,585
So you got the knife,
and then what happened?

503
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:25,691
When I walked back in,
Zach was on top of her.

504
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:30,726
He took the knife
and he stabbed
her over and over.

505
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,898
There was all this
blood and I threw up!

506
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:37,375
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry!

507
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,141
(SOBBING)

508
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:41,471
I'm sorry.

509
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:44,449
Jeremy, who covered her up
with the blanket?

510
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,614
I did.

511
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:51,684
You shouldn't Ieave
someone Iike that.

512
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,321
Can I go home now?

513
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,097
I just want to go home.

514
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:00,094
I want to go home.

515
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:03,365
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

516
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,943
CSU finished
with Zach's house?

517
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:13,003
Top to bottom. No blood.
Must have tossed the clothes
he was wearing.

518
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:14,810
So we've got two kids,
two different stories,

519
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,475
and either one of them
could have killed her.

520
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:18,849
Which means I have
an even bigger problem.

521
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,582
Whether or not to
try Jeremy Brice
as an adult.

522
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:23,146
Zachary Connor is 12.

523
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:26,022
So even if he acted alone,
he's out of my jurisdiction.

524
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:27,618
He is going
to Family Court.

525
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:30,061
And what kind of punishment
is kiddie court handing out

526
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:31,894
for rapists and murderers
these days?

527
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,298
Their mandate is
rehabilitation,
not punishment.

528
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:38,829
So the maximum
sentence is 18 months
in a Iimited secure facility.

529
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:41,000
And Jeremy's Iooking
at Iife in Attica.

530
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:43,942
If the D.A. thinks
he's a danger
to society, yes.

531
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:47,140
Okay, I got to tell you
that I believe Jeremy's
version of the events.

532
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:50,844
You know,
this kid is more of a danger
to himself than anybody else.

533
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,285
Doc, you saw both interviews.
What do you think?

534
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:54,946
I agree with you.

535
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,786
Jeremy is more
easily manipulated.

536
00:25:56,858 --> 00:25:58,951
He's desperate to
fit in at any cost,

537
00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:01,587
whereas Zachary is
far more calculating.

538
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:04,131
I think he wields
a great deal of control
over Jeremy,

539
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:07,599
and I think he
murdered and raped
Susan Oestreicher.

540
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:12,735
So the question is
do we go after Jeremy
because we can't get Zachary?

541
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,267
No.

542
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:19,304
I'II recommend
we remove Jeremy
to family court.

543
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:32,655
The D.A. is seeking
an indictment against
Jeremy Brice.

544
00:26:32,727 --> 00:26:34,820
You've got one day
to prepare for
the grand jury.

545
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:36,523
On what charges?

546
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:38,122
Felony murder
and burglary one.

547
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:40,133
I recommended against it.

548
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:41,463
Well, the D.A. disagreed.

549
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,939
But the evidence clearly
indicates that Jeremy Brice's
involvement was Iimited.

550
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:48,475
The DNA proves
that Zachary Connor
committed the rape.

551
00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:51,706
Jeremy already confessed
to participating
in the burglary.

552
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:52,803
That's the predicate felony.

553
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,905
He knew it was dangerous,
he knew someone
could be killed.

554
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:56,473
No, he didn't.

555
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:59,179
This boy is not mature
enough to understand that.

556
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:01,050
The Iaw says he is.

557
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:04,421
That Iegislation
was passed in 1978

558
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:07,859
as a knee-jerk reaction
to some perceived
youth crime wave.

559
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:10,523
It also says that
we prosecute
juveniles as adults

560
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:13,499
at the discretion of
the district attorney.

561
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:16,002
He made the call.
You do your job.

562
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:19,037
Which should be easy enough
with Jeremy's confession.

563
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,141
A win for the D.A.

564
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,178
So that's what this is about.

565
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:25,974
'Cause I'd Iike to know just
how much of a sycophant

566
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,845
I have to be in this
new administration.

567
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:32,549
Let's say you're right.

568
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,349
Let's say Zachary Connor
did everything.

569
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:37,914
That means every
step of the way,
Jeremy Brice had a choice.

570
00:27:38,593 --> 00:27:40,686
Do the right thing
or do the wrong thing.

571
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:45,594
Watch your friend
rape a defenseless
woman or stop him,

572
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:48,602
run away or
give him the knife
so he can stab her to death.

573
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,402
Do we punish
him for this?

574
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:54,805
Or do we tell him that
there are no consequences
for his actions?

575
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:58,437
We remove him to Family Court
in hopes of rehabilitation.

576
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:02,373
That won't happen if he goes
J.O. and you know it.

577
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,749
You have more faith in
the Juvenile Justice
Department than I do.

578
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:13,087
You're adamantly opposed
to prosecuting this case?

579
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:15,925
Yes. I think it's wrong.

580
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:18,930
AII right.

581
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,459
Then I'II do it.

582
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:25,568
You're second chair.

583
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:34,877
EIizabeth Donnelly
is back trying cases?

584
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:38,146
Or did your new boss
demote you already?

585
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:41,916
Funny comments Iike that,
it's a wonder both
your Iegs aren't broken.

586
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:44,253
You get attacked
by one of your repeat
offenders again?

587
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:47,590
No, actually one of your
esteemed colleagues
knocked me off a curb.

588
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:49,152
There's a
Iaw suit pending.

589
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:53,056
AIexandra Cabot,
Gina Bernardo,
public defender.

590
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:54,158
Nice to meet you.

591
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:58,433
So the D.A. has assembled
a Iegal dream team
to crucify a child.

592
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,838
You know as well as I do
charging Jeremy Brice

593
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:03,103
as an adult is
a gross injustice.

594
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:04,940
Tell that to
Susan Oestreicher's family.

595
00:29:05,012 --> 00:29:08,413
You honestly believe
he deserves to be
charged for murder two?

596
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:10,314
The grand jury did.

597
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:13,319
You can't possibly hold
my client responsible
for something

598
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:16,481
it's impossible for him
to be responsible for.

599
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:19,586
Notification of
affirmative defense.

600
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,857
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

601
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:26,798
What defect?

602
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,235
His 14-year-old brain.

603
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:32,929
DONNELLY: Your Honor,
this is an obvious attempt

604
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:34,531
to backdoor
the defense of infancy.

605
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:38,773
Article 30 clearly states that
defense cannot be used for
juveniles charged with murder.

606
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:42,304
I'm not saying that my
client isn't responsible
because of his age.

607
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:45,648
I am saying he isn't
responsible because
of his diminished capacity.

608
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,814
Dictated by his age.
It's the same thing.

609
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,381
This is a Iegislative issue,
Your Honor, not a matter
for the court.

610
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:55,054
Then why did three
Supreme Court justices
draft a public statement

611
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:57,689
calling for the abolishment
of juvenile executions?

612
00:29:57,765 --> 00:30:01,963
Because it is cruel and
unusual to impose adult
punishment on someone

613
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,901
who isn't capable
of adult thought.

614
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,166
Couldn't one argue then
that certain behavior,

615
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,540
such as the committing
of a violent crime,
proves adult thought?

616
00:30:10,611 --> 00:30:13,978
No. If your 10-year-old
son takes your car
out for a joy ride,

617
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:16,380
do you automatically
hand him
a driver's Iicense?

618
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,042
This is all very interesting,
Ms. Bernardo,

619
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:21,350
but I fail to see
how any of this applies
to an insanity defense.

620
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,185
These are scientific studies

621
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:27,193
proving that an adolescent's
brain is significantly
different than an aduIt's.

622
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:31,129
That, in fact, our brains
aren't fully formed until
we're in our early 20s.

623
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,258
And I can present scientific
studies which prove

624
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,996
my cat is trying
to kill me in my sleep.

625
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,230
Daubert test, Your Honor.

626
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:40,741
Scientific evidence must meet
federal standards of relevance
and reliability.

627
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:44,266
Well, one of the studies was
done by the National Institute
of Mental Health.

628
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:46,677
Is the federal government
reliable enough for you?

629
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:49,944
The reliability
of the studies
isn't in question.

630
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:54,147
My job is to determine
whether or not they have
any material value.

631
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:55,883
I believe they do.

632
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:58,521
And I believe
the jury should hear them.

633
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:06,900
Dr. Hayman, can you
tell us about the study
you recently completed?

634
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:09,733
We used functional magnetic
resonance imaging

635
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:12,774
to map the brains of healthy
adolescents over several years

636
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:15,071
and compared them
to those of healthy adults.

637
00:31:15,143 --> 00:31:17,202
And what did your study find?

638
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,806
For adolescents,
brain activity is much
higher in the amygdala,

639
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:24,011
which guides instincts
Iike fear or anger.

640
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:27,317
In adults, the activity
in the frontal
Iobe is higher,

641
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:30,620
and that's the seat
of reasoning and
good judgment.

642
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:33,661
BERNARDO: So what are
the conclusions of
your findings?

643
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:37,187
Adolescents are
physiologically prone

644
00:31:37,266 --> 00:31:39,530
to impulsive and
irrational behavior.

645
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:46,006
So teenagers are moody
and unpredictable,
and even violent,

646
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:47,974
because they are
wired that way?

647
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:49,772
Objection. Leading.

648
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:51,210
Sustained.

649
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,680
That's all.
No further questions.

650
00:31:56,818 --> 00:32:03,690
So, your study says
that teenagers are
impulsive and irrational.

651
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:09,796
Here's what
I don't understand.

652
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:13,858
If that's true,
how is it that
every single teenager

653
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:16,461
isn't a rapist or a murderer?

654
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:20,372
I believe I said
adolescents were prone
to certain behaviors.

655
00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:24,378
Then some teenagers
are perfectly
reasonable and rational.

656
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,538
Yes.

657
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,510
How many?

658
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:30,442
How many what?

659
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,080
How many teenagers are
rational and how many are
rapists and murderers?

660
00:32:35,123 --> 00:32:36,556
There's no answer
to that question.

661
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,092
I thought you
mapped their brains.

662
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,095
We haven't tested
every single teenager
in the world.

663
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:46,598
Oh. So if you had given MRIs
to every single teenager,

664
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:50,263
you would be able to predict
whether or not they would be
a criminal. Is that it?

665
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:52,136
No.
Well, what?

666
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:55,074
If the irrational
part of the brain
is overactive,

667
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:57,373
that proves that
they'II be violent,
doesn't it?

668
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:59,311
It doesn't
prove anything.

669
00:32:59,381 --> 00:33:01,474
This research is
in its infancy.

670
00:33:02,384 --> 00:33:04,443
Your study doesn't
prove anything?

671
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,180
Not what you're
asking for, but...

672
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:09,087
Then it's a theory,
an unproven theory.

673
00:33:09,157 --> 00:33:11,625
This research is
a huge step forward

674
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:13,285
in understanding
how the brain works.

675
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:17,093
Which is just another way
of saying we really don't
understand the brain at all.

676
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:21,760
Nothing further.

677
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,468
BERNARDO: Jeremy, do you know
the difference between
what's right and what's wrong?

678
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:31,403
Yes.

679
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,041
Was it wrong to break
into Susan Oestreicher's
apartment?

680
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:37,711
Yes.

681
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,585
Then why did you do it?

682
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:43,152
Zach said he
wanted some money.

683
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:45,022
Do you always do
what Zach wants?

684
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:47,991
He's my best friend.

685
00:33:48,063 --> 00:33:51,089
Jeremy, did you know
that Zach was planning
to kill that woman?

686
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:53,258
JEREMY: No.

687
00:33:53,702 --> 00:33:56,136
And if you thought
even for one moment

688
00:33:56,204 --> 00:33:57,899
that that's what
he wanted to do,

689
00:33:57,973 --> 00:33:59,531
would you have gone
with him to the apartment,

690
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:01,735
even though he's
your best friend?

691
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,936
No.

692
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,072
I don't want
anyone to get killed.

693
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:08,048
BERNARDO: Jeremy,
what is more wrong?

694
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:12,382
Watching someone do something
terrible or telling on your
only friend?

695
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:18,492
I don't know.

696
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,262
So, maybe, you don't
know right from wrong
as much as you think.

697
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:28,129
Thank you, Jeremy.

698
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,470
Who hit Susan Oestreicher
over the head?

699
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,302
Zach.

700
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:39,507
Hard enough so she
was knocked out, right?

701
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:40,605
Yeah.

702
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:43,207
Then Zach told you
to get the knife.

703
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:47,246
He... He said to
Iook in the kitchen.

704
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:49,017
Did you think he
was going to stab her?

705
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:50,750
No.

706
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:52,817
What did you think
he was going to do?

707
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:57,055
Scare her.
He didn't want
her to yell.

708
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:59,930
But she wasn't awake.
How would she yell?

709
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,265
I don't know.

710
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:05,636
What do people do
with knives, Jeremy?

711
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:09,441
Cut things.

712
00:35:09,978 --> 00:35:13,379
So you walked
into the kitchen
and you got the knife.

713
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:14,506
Yes.

714
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,375
You said you were
afraid of Zach. Why?

715
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:18,851
He was yelling at me.

716
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,320
Why didn't you
walk out the door?

717
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,794
I don't know.

718
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:32,857
So, you got the knife.

719
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,832
You walked back to Zach,

720
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:38,873
and you were holding
the knife in your hands.

721
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,100
Yes.

722
00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:41,904
Why did you
give it to him?

723
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:44,138
Was it because you were
afraid or because you

724
00:35:44,212 --> 00:35:46,806
wanted to be
cool for your friend?

725
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:47,940
I don't know!

726
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:50,109
You knew what he
was going to do,

727
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:52,551
and you helped him do it.
Isn't that why?

728
00:35:54,122 --> 00:35:55,589
I'm sorry!

729
00:35:56,192 --> 00:35:58,319
I'm so sorry.

730
00:35:58,394 --> 00:35:59,884
I'm so sorry.

731
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:01,793
I'm sorry.

732
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:03,863
I'm sorry.

733
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:07,892
(JEREMY SOBBING)

734
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:13,666
Nothing further.

735
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,507
I'm so sorry.

736
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:27,951
AIex.

737
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:31,750
Well, guess you got
what you wanted.

738
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:36,763
Destroying a child on
the stand is not quite
the highlight of my career.

739
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,458
You did your job.

740
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:40,627
Careful, AIex.

741
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:44,799
You're beginning to sound
Iike me, disillusioned
before your time.

742
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:48,636
I need you to subpoena
a rebuttal witness.

743
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:49,973
Who?
Zachary Connor.

744
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,138
Why?

745
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:53,512
As of today,
he's been adjudicated
by Family Court.

746
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:57,144
Any testimony he gives
won't be tainted
by his co-conspirator status.

747
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,710
If you put Zachary Connor
on the stand,

748
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:01,757
he's going to say that
Jeremy did everything and
I believe that's a Iie.

749
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,657
I'm not putting him
on the stand. You are.

750
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:07,491
Jury already thinks
I make Iittle kids cry.

751
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:09,428
No. I won't
suborn perjury.

752
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:12,365
Then I guess you
better make sure
he tells the truth.

753
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:23,404
CABOT: Zachary,
who killed Susan Oestreicher?

754
00:37:24,513 --> 00:37:25,878
Jeremy did.

755
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:28,311
So he stabbed
her with a knife?

756
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:29,681
Yes.

757
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,277
That must have been
very frightening for you.

758
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:34,186
Yes. I was scared.

759
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:35,986
What were you scared of?

760
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:37,252
Jeremy.

761
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:38,851
Why?

762
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:41,158
Because he's bigger.

763
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:44,090
Was Jeremy
afraid of anything?

764
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,224
Yes.

765
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:46,760
What?

766
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:49,470
He was just afraid.
He didn't want to get caught.

767
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:51,096
But you did get caught.

768
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:52,663
Miss Oestreicher came home.

769
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:55,575
That was Jeremy's fault.
He got it wrong.

770
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:58,276
You must have been really
scared when she walked in
that door?

771
00:37:58,347 --> 00:37:59,814
No, I wasn't.

772
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:00,940
Okay.

773
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:04,849
Zachary, when did
you throw up?

774
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:06,847
That was Jeremy.

775
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:09,288
I thought you
were afraid, Zachary.

776
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,384
I thought you threw up
because you couldn't
Iook at the blood.

777
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:14,929
I could, too.
Jeremy couldn't.

778
00:38:14,997 --> 00:38:16,760
He was being a baby
and crying.

779
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,164
When? Before or after
she was killed?

780
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:20,395
The whole time.

781
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:22,699
And you weren't crying?
Not even just a Iittle?

782
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:23,864
No.

783
00:38:23,939 --> 00:38:25,372
But I thought you
were afraid, Zachary.

784
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:27,705
I thought you were
afraid of Jeremy.

785
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:28,971
No, I wasn't.

786
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:32,208
And you were also afraid
of that woman because she
was going to call the police.

787
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:33,339
She was afraid of me.

788
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,884
And you wanted to show
them both that you were a man,

789
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:37,350
and that's why you
had sex with her.

790
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,480
Well, that was her fault
because she wouldn't tell
me where the money was.

791
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:43,787
Jeremy was crying!
He wouldn't do anything
so I had to do it!

792
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:47,226
If she had just told me where
the money was, I wouldn't have
had to hurt her!

793
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:51,958
Nothing further.

794
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:03,805
Five to 10 years.

795
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,540
He wouldn't get out
until he was 24?

796
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:09,743
It's the minimum sentence.
With good behavior,
he's out in five.

797
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:12,913
But if they say not guilty,
he won't go to jail at all.

798
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:17,448
The jury will not say that.
The Iaw is very clear.

799
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:19,494
Jeremy already admitted
to being in the apartment

800
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:22,463
with the intent to burglarize
it and someone was killed.

801
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:25,866
He can still be found
guilty of felony murder.

802
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:28,529
You want me to tell you
to send my son to jail.

803
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:31,368
Why don't we take a day
to think about this?

804
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,465
No. I don't need
to think about it.

805
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,739
The answer is no.
He didn't hurt anyone.

806
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:42,250
Mrs. Brice, if Jeremy is
convicted, he is facing
a possible Iife sentence.

807
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:48,787
Miss Bernardo, please tell
your client's mother how
rare jury nullification is.

808
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:50,485
We should take the deal.

809
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,524
I don't Iike taking
chances with the jury.

810
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:55,354
They heard that other boy.

811
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:59,094
They know Jeremy is good,
and they won't
send him to jail.

812
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:00,965
No.

813
00:40:01,537 --> 00:40:02,765
No deal.

814
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:14,478
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

815
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,313

817

We find the defendant guilty.

818
00:40:23,392 --> 00:40:24,859
No!

819
00:40:28,097 --> 00:40:31,897
RIDENOUR: On the second count,
burglary in the first degree,
how do you find?

We find
the defendant guilty.

821
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:40,432
Poll the jury, Your Honor.

822
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:43,205

827

829
00:40:56,492 --> 00:40:57,584

831
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:00,521

Juror number six?

833
00:41:01,964 --> 00:41:03,226
Guilty.

834
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:05,392
Juror number seven?

835
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:06,696
Guilty.
