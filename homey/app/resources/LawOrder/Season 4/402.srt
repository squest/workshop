1
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:07,170
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:10,870
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,139
In New York City,

4
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:15,011
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,609
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,711
These are their stories.

7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,818
So what kinds of things
do you Iike to draw, Chloe?

8
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:25,984
Cats.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,550
Cats?
I Iike cats.

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:33,462
You know, your teacher
showed me a really
great picture that you drew.

11
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,627
Is that your family?
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,341
Are you
in this picture?

13
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,270
That's me
and that's Mommy
and Kyle.

14
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,005
You Iook sad
in this picture.
Are those tears?

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,347
Why are you crying?

16
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,884
Kyle is your brother?

17
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,891
He's my half-brother.

18
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,052
Oh, 'cause
you guys have
different moms, right?

19
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,187
We have the same daddy.
Daddy?

20
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,698
There's no daddy
in this picture.
Where's he?

21
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:06,960
He's out of town.

22
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,501
Is that
why you're sad?

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,695
No.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,397
Okay. Chloe,

25
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,708
are you sad
'cause someone's
hurting you?

26
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,870
I don't know.

27
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,948
Usually Chloe's
very happy, outgoing,

28
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:25,883
but Iately
she's been withdrawn.

29
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,716
And I've noticed
some bruises
on her Iegs.

30
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,949
Okay, once
Detective Benson's
finished talking with her

31
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,219
we'II need to take her
to the hospital
for an exam.

32
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,727
The father's
a Iittle high-strung.
What do I tell him?

33
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,286
We'II send an officer
here to meet him,
bring him to the hospital.

34
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,422
What do you mean,
high-strung?

35
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:42,265
A yeller. You know,
corporate mogul type,
Lawrence Fuller.

36
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,330
Fuller Telecom?
Yeah.

37
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,463
Guy's name
is on my cable bill.

38
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,737
Well, you should probably
also know that Chloe's
mother is GIoria Stanfield.

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,143
The actress.
She did a few movies
about 10 years ago.

40
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,476
So you're asking
for discretion.

41
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,278
No, I'm just giving you
fair warning.
They're both a handful.

42
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:02,118
Chloe, your mom
and Kyle Iook
really happy here, huh?

43
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,392
How come you're
the only one
that's sad?

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,156
Because Mommy
Ioves Kyle
more than me.

45
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,695
I bet she Ioves you
both the same.

46
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:16,793
She reads him stories
all the time,
but not to me.

47
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,406
Where does she
read Kyle stories?

48
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,941
In his room.

49
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,402
They close the door
and I'm not allowed.

50
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,412
You never
went in there?
Not one time?

51
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,650
It was because
I heard noises.

52
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,583
I thought
Mommy was crying.

53
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,390
What were they doing?

54
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,825
They were
playing in bed.

55
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:50,895
They didn't have
any clothes on.

56
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,117
The colposcopic exam
didn't reveal any signs
of sexual abuse.

57
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,286
Anything that indicates
straight physical abuse?

58
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,761
Some bruises
on her shins.

59
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,991
Pretty typical
for a five-year-old.

60
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,261
Scan showed healed wrist
and tibia fractures,

61
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,065
but she doesn't remember
how she got them.

62
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,126
You talk
to the parents yet?

63
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,469
Actually, we're gonna wait
till we speak with Chloe.

64
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,944
Yeah, well, I think that's
her father, and he Iooks
Iike he wants to go.

65
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,213
Are you the detectives
who brought my daughter here?

66
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,012
Is she all right?
She's fine, Mr. Fuller.

67
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,315
Why don't we go someplace
where we can discuss it
more privately?

68
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,252
School tells me
I have to go
to the hospital.

69
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,586
No one tells me why.
Is Chloe hurt?

70
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,149
No. No, but there was
some concern
at her school.

71
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,626
Concern about what?

72
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:25,187
She said some things
that might indicate
problems at home.

73
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,358
What kind of problems?

74
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,527
Actually, we were hoping
that you could help us
with that.

75
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,333
When did Chloe
break her wrist
and her Ieg?

76
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:36,536
When she was three.
She fell off a slide
in a playground.

77
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,738
Is that what this is about?
It was an accident.

78
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,838
You dragged her
to a hospital for that?

79
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,407
We brought her here
based on a picture
she drew at school

80
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,387
and statements
she made to
Detective Benson

81
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,319
which seemed to

82
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:56,294
describe a sexual
relationship between
your wife and your son.

83
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,295
What are you
talking about?
What kind of picture?

84
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:03,962
Your daughter said
she'd seen them sleeping
in the same bed together.

85
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,836
Are you out of your mind?
She's his mother.

86
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,398
BENSON: Do you think that
Chloe made it up?

87
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:11,871
She had to. I...

88
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,470
Where's your wife
now, Mr. Fuller?

89
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,573
Our house in the Hamptons,
antique shopping.

90
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,381
Have you ever seen
any behavior that
confirms Chloe's story?

91
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,382
I don't think so.

92
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,157
But you damn well better believe
I'II be finding out.

93
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,319
Sir, it's really
best if you allow us
to investigate.

94
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,694
You investigate all you Iike.
I'm taking Chloe home.

95
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:38,171
Kyle Fuller's school
records describe a normal,
well-adjusted kid,

96
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,832
till the second grade
when his mother was
killed in a car accident.

97
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,603
Not surprising
he had a tough time.

98
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,166
In the fifth grade
his behavior got worse.

99
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:47,475
Loss of appetite,
sudden outbursts,
fighting.

100
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,743
That was the same year
his father married
GIoria Stanfield.

101
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,648
Well, it could be
adjusting to a stepmother.

102
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:54,586
Or the stepmother
pulled a Woody AIIen
way back then.

103
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,624
Proving that's the only way
we're gonna charge her
with statutory rape.

104
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,818
It's not illegal to have
sex with a 17-year-old.

105
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,417
He turned 17 Iast month.

106
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,020
You don't think
it's Iikely that the abuse
started Iong before that?

107
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,532
Doesn't matter what
I think if they're not
breaking the Iaw.

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,037
Even if the abuse started
yesterday, she's still
essentially his mother.

109
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,369
She's taking advantage
of her control over him.

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,069
Unless he's a normal teenager
who's just happy to be
banging an actress.

111
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,509
Look, if nothing else,

112
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,809
that environment
is unhealthy
for that Iittle girl.

113
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,679
Well, this all depends
on whether we believe
what she's saying is true.

114
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,775
BENSON: And I do.

115
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:28,151
Kids her age
don't usually make up
things Iike this.

116
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,585
When is the mother
due back in town?

117
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,354
Anytime, if she gets word
we're Iooking at her.

118
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,362
She's gonna want to circle
the family wagons.

119
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,422
Well, I'd Iike to know
if we have a complaining
witness before that happens.

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,832
Fin, you and John
go talk to Kyle.

121
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,837
If he is a victim, he may
want to know there's something
he can do to stop it.

122
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,204
You know, a family
Iike this probably has
plenty of hired help.

123
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,470
Something's going on
in that house,
they'd know about it.

124
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,034
AII right, discretion,
everybody.

125
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,774
The Ionger we keep this
out of the papers,
the better.

126
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,084
Kyle Fuller.
Can we talk to you
alone for a minute?

127
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,547
I'II see you guys Iater.
Yeah.

128
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,753
What's this about?

129
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,728
You talk to
your father today?

130
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,766
No, I won't see him
till tonight. Why,
did something happen?

131
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,802
He's fine.
How things going
for you at home?

132
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,136
Okay. Why?

133
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,431
Get along with
your mother?

134
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,168
My stepmother?

135
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,938
She's all right.
Why are you asking
about her?

136
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,606
One of our detectives
talked to your sister Chloe.

137
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,410
We're with the
Special Victims Unit.

138
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,646
One of the things
we investigate
is child abuse.

139
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,146
You think Chloe's
being abused?

140
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,019
FIN: No, not Chloe. You.

141
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,351
She told you that?

142
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:43,021
She said you and your
stepmother sleep
in the same bed. Is that true?

143
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,793
Okay, wait.

144
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,995
Wait. If you think
that we're sleeping together,

145
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:54,098
Iike, having sex,
that's just sick.

146
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,541
I mean, GIoria's been
my stepmom since I was,
Iike, 10.

147
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,478
And you don't wanna
get her into trouble.
We understand that.

148
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,574
No. It's just that
there's no way that
we're sleeping together

149
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,243
or having sex
or anything.

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,689
I mean, if that's
what Chloe told you,
Iook, I'm sorry, I really am.

151
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,225
I'm sorry you came down here
and wasted your time,

152
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,454
but it's just not true.

153
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,124
Okay?

154
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,795
Detectives,
I've told you three times,

155
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,468
my employment contract
includes a
confidentiality clause.

156
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,704
Meaning
you know something,
you just can't say.

157
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,075
That's not what I mean.

158
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,909
Do you get along with
Ms. Stanfield?

159
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,815
She's an excellent employer,
and that's all I will say.

160
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,580
Well, what do they
pay you for
a gig Iike this?

161
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,348
That's none
of your concern.

162
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,413
I'II bet there are
a Iot of under-the-table
cash transactions.

163
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,685
Is that true?

164
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,057
Well, we could find out.
Drop a dime to the IRS,

165
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,564
have them go through
your undeclared cash income
with a fine-toothed comb.

166
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,532
That would jam her up for,
what, about three years?

167
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,794
Minimum.

168
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,231
We find truth in
what Chloe is saying,
your boss is going down.

169
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,742
You'd better
decide right now.
You want to join her?

170
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,806
I saw them together once,
a few weeks ago.

171
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,246
Doing what?

172
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,351
I walked into the room.

173
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,114
She was kissing Kyle.

174
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,381
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

175
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,322
It wasn't the way
a mother kisses her son.

176
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,122
Benson.
It was only a moment.

177
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,491
I hardly saw anything.

178
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,053
It sounds Iike
you saw plenty.

179
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,359
BENSON: Thanks.

180
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,027
GIoria Stanfield's
back in town.
At her Iawyer's office.

181
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,502
Our presence
is kindly requested.

182
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,704
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Detectives.

183
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,646
You must know my client,
GIoria Stanfield.

184
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,839
Heard a Iot about you.

185
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,044
GLORIA: I'II be with you
in a minute.

186
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:50,351
She wanted to clear
this matter up as soon
as she got back to town.

187
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,448
STABLER: How were
the Hamptons?

188
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,617
Dull.

189
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,521
I know the other detectives
already spoke to Kyle.

190
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,689
He told you the truth.

191
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,222
I am not having
a sexual relationship
with my stepson.

192
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,166
What more
can I tell you?

193
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,206
You think Chloe
Iied about it?

194
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,040
I think she
makes up stories.
She's a child.

195
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,341
Well, then,
why do we have
other adult witnesses

196
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:17,474
who describe
a pretty passionate kiss
between you and your stepson?

197
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,644
I kiss everyone,
Detective.

198
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,650
The simple fact
is you're investigating

199
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,920
the misconception of
an imaginative five-year-old.

200
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,596
Where do you think
Chloe got these ideas from?

201
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:33,030
Television, probably.
My old movies,
for that matter.

202
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,995
You know, this is
really ridiculous.

203
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,698
Chloe draws a picture,
and everyone blows it
out of proportion.

204
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,038
I would never do anything
to hurt my stepson.

205
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,875
No complaining witness,
no physical evidence of abuse,

206
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:52,112
no independent verification
other than an
uncooperative housekeeper

207
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,915
who saw a stepmother
kiss her stepson.

208
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,718
And no indictment
based on a
kindergartner's art project.

209
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,986
There's something
going on in that house.

210
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,118
That woman's wrong.

211
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,889
We're gonna need more
than your gut.

212
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,454
I can contact my counterpart
at Children's Services.

213
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,500
At the very Ieast,
they can start
a file on GIoria.

214
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,967
I just got a call
from a patrol
out of the 22

215
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,801
responding to
a domestic disturbance
at the Formby Day School.

216
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:13,999
What happened?

217
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,976
GIoria and her husband
are fighting over
who's taking the daughter.

218
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,672
You Iet me take
my daughter home
right now

219
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,976
or I will slap a Iawsuit
on you so fast...
Don't Iet him near her.

220
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,778
You see
how angry he gets.

221
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,909
Shut up.
She raped my son.

222
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,113
God knows what she did
to my daughter.
Our daughter.

223
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,679
Look, you don't deserve
to be a mother.
You're disgusting.

224
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:31,951
Yeah, make up
some more stories.

225
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,051
Everyone knows it's so you can
get out of child support
when I divorce you!

226
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,291
I'm gonna kill you
if you touch my children!
Mr. Fuller!

227
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,596
I don't want to hear
another threat Iike that.
Now, am I clear?

228
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,102
Yeah.
You say I'm the abuser.

229
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:48,369
He hits me and he hits them.
You should investigate that!

230
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,467
You two
can fight this out
in Family Court.

231
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,876
Until then,
your children will be
in the custody of the state.

232
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,379
What?
You can't do that!

233
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,281
If we think your children
are in imminent danger,
we certainly can.

234
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,979
If they keep at it,
bring them in
for disorderly conduct.

235
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,215
FULLER: Oh, no, no, no.
Chloe, sweetheart.

236
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,279
Wait a minute.

237
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,648
Baby.

238
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,784
FULLER: No.
It's okay.

239
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,259
This is kidnapping!

240
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,764
Munch, I need you to do
an emergency removal
of Kyle Fuller.

241
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,197
Pick him up at his school.

242
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,200
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

243
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:20,105
You guys are friends
of Kyle Fuller, right?

244
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,663
You seen him?

245
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,835
He Ieft already.
What are you guys
investigating?

246
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,675
Kyle get along okay
with his family?
His stepmom?

247
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,181
Yeah, he and GIoria
got along really well.

248
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,477
How do you know?

249
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,575
Well, everybody knows
about GIoria.

250
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,916
She's very open.

251
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,118
What, is she putting out
for all his school buddies?

252
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,023
Not that. She just Iikes
having guys around.

253
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,560
She doesn't mind,
you know,
if you Iook at her.

254
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,324
Yeah, it's Iike she's
wearing clothes, but you can
totally see through them.

255
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,524
And she's always giving
everybody backrubs.

256
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,726
And what does
Kyle think of all this?

257
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,961
He digs it.

258
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,764
It's not his real mom,
so who cares?

259
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,771
It sounds Iike you think
there's more going on

260
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,774
than just backrubs
and peep shows.

261
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:59,778
I don't know
if he's banging her,
but I wouldn't be surprised.

262
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,241
Where's the Iittle one?

263
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,718
ACS placed her
with an aunt
and uncle in the area.

264
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,518
Well, Iet's all hope
insanity isn't
a family trait.

265
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,818
Any Iuck with Kyle?

266
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,291
No. Not at home,
not with friends.

267
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,456
Munch and Fin are still
out Iooking, and your day
isn't over yet.

268
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,639
Doorman called it in.
No witnesses.
Nobody heard a struggle.

269
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,233
Where's the rest
of the Addams family?

270
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,938
MIA.
Forced entry?

271
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,277
Door was ajar,
Iocks intact.

272
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,943
Whoever did this
knew the security code.
There's no apparent robbery.

273
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,283
Bashed in
his skull, Ieft.

274
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,096
BIow to the back of the head's
probably what did it,

275
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,727
but he's got impact
wounds to the torso,
thighs, forearms.

276
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,963
Went down fighting.

277
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,405
Murder weapon Iooks Iike
it's cylindrical, two
or three inches in diameter.

278
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,736
MUNCH: Like a baseball bat?

279
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,174
That'd do it.

280
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,436
I found it
under Kyle's bed.
I'II bag it for prints.

281
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:11,314
Fin's talking to
the doorman to see
if Kyle Ieft in a hurry.

282
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,375
Mr. Fuller came in
around 8:00.

283
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,149
After about 20 minutes,
Ms. Stanfield Ieft,

284
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,691
then Kyle about
15 minutes Iater.

285
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,522
Did you notice
anything unusual
about either of them?

286
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,462
Ms. Stanfield
was in a hurry,
but that's typical.

287
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,967
Kyle. I guess
he seemed a Iittle upset.

288
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,292
Where are
the other entrances?

289
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,394
Back and side doors,

290
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,996
but they're all Iocked
and hooked up
to the alarm system.

291
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,702
And no one enters
without signing in.

292
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,007
Pretty quiet today.
Nobody out of the ordinary.

293
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,775
Just guests of the tenants.

294
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,578
Okay. I'm gonna
get this back to you, okay?

295
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,218
What's going on?

296
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,916
Your father was killed.

297
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:55,425
Somebody attacked him
in your apartment.
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,926
Where's GIoria?

299
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,968
Well, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

300
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,663
You're taking
your father's death
kind of well, though.

301
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,103
Come on.

302
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,605
It's my day off.

303
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,199
I stopped by
to check on
Ms. Stanfield

304
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,438
and the front door was open.

305
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,481
I came in,
found Mr. Fuller.

306
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,743
Why were you
checking on
Ms. Stanfield?

307
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,012
She called
after you took Chloe.

308
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,749
She was so upset.
I wanted to make sure
she was all right.

309
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,489
You know where
she was calling from?

310
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,321
I assumed here.

311
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:30,227
There was no one else
in the apartment.

312
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,960
She couldn't have done this,
Detective. It's not possible.

313
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,226
MUNCH: How'd you get
that shiner?

314
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:38,703
At school, in Phys Ed.

315
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,296
It Iooks Iike
you got punched.

316
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,465
Thought it might be
your dad.

317
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,565
MUNCH: Is that what happened?

318
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,371
He started to hit you
and you defended yourself?

319
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,502
No.

320
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,874
I didn't kill him.

321
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,313
Any idea who did?

322
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,651
Where'd you go tonight?

323
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,577
For a walk.

324
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:57,680
MUNCH: Why?

325
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:58,122
Because I felt Iike it.

326
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,422
Your dad and stepmom
were home
before you Ieft.

327
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:04,055
That's gotta be a pretty
contentious relationship
these days, huh?

328
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,792
I don't know anything
about it.

329
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:09,063
Okay, you went out
for a walk.
Where'd GIoria go?

330
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:10,932
She didn't kill him.

331
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:14,099
FIN: Well, how do you know?
You went out for a walk.

332
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:17,266
I just know.

333
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:19,575
How many school uniforms
do you have?

334
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:23,642
About six.
Where's the one
you wore today?

335
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:25,049
I changed when I got home.

336
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:28,577
BIood stains kind of clash
with the school colors, huh?

337
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,852
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

338
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,257
Detectives.

339
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,269
Hold off
on the questions
for a minute.

340
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,328
Why?
Kid Iawyered up.

341
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:51,868
Mr. Schaefer,
if you'II follow me
to interrogation.

342
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:55,575
You're not worried about
a conflict of interest there,
Counselor?

343
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,549
Ms. Stanfield
is a suspect also.

344
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,553
If charges are filed,
Kyle obtains new counsel.

345
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,385
Until then,
no conflict.

346
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:04,890
Who's representing you?

347
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,484
I'II answer any questions
you have without
my attorney present.

348
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,290
I'm gonna advise you
against that.

349
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,730
No. Really, it's okay.
I haven't got anything
to hide.

350
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,324
Right this way.

351
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:19,236
I have no idea what happened.
I went to a hotel tonight.

352
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:20,466
STABLER: Why?

353
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,168
You saw my husband
at the school.

354
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:25,337
Do you honestly think
I wanted to be anywhere
near that man?

355
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,643
BENSON: Well, then
why go home at all?

356
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:30,548
Well, Detective Benson,
to get my things.

357
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,444
My stepson was there.

358
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,489
I tried to explain to him
what was happening.

359
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:37,957
Kyle got so angry,

360
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,016
and then Lawrence walked in.

361
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,755
They started fighting.

362
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:44,889
Lawrence got physical,
as usual, pushed him.

363
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,126
I couldn't stand it
anymore so I Ieft.

364
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:50,568
You Ieft your husband
to push around your stepson?

365
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:52,469
How would I stop him?

366
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:56,302
Believe me, I've tried.
It only makes things worse.

367
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:59,278
Will the hotel
confirm your story?

368
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,474
The Sienna.
They'II tell you
when I checked in.

369
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,074
Is that all?

370
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,277
One more thing.

371
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:09,347
Was your husband
still breathing
when you Ieft?

372
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,653
I didn't kill him.

373
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:15,420
I have no reason.

374
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,623
Well, actually,
I could think of a couple.

375
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,825
Custody of the kids.
Inheriting his money.

376
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,767
Lawrence made me sign
a prenuptial agreement.

377
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:26,432
He always believed
that I was a gold digger
at heart.

378
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:32,446
The money goes to
Kyle and Chloe in trusts that
I am not allowed to touch.

379
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:36,108
So when you Ieft
Kyle and his father
were still fighting?

380
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,182
Kyle didn't do this.

381
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,982
But you'd already Ieft,
so you don't know
that for sure.

382
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:43,853
Look, I will answer
any questions
that you have about me,

383
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:46,859
but I just Iost my husband
and my daughter.

384
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:50,293
I'm not gonna help you
frame my stepson.

385
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:53,666
CABOT: Anyone Iook good
for the arrest?

386
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:57,101
Well, one's covering
for the other.
I'm just not sure who.

387
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:59,264
The murder weapon was found
under the boy's bed.

388
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,865
I'm guessing GIoria Stanfield
doesn't have a baseball bat.

389
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,001
Well, doesn't mean
she didn't borrow it.

390
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,602
Kyle came back
to the crime scene.

391
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,670
If he killed the guy,
why the hell
didn't he stay away?

392
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:11,741
Maybe to pick up
the murder weapon.
Only one set of prints on it.

393
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,611
Kyle Fuller's.

394
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:17,155
Arrest him.

395
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:22,255
We have been more than
cooperative, so if you're not
planning on arresting Kyle...

396
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,921
Stand up.
Why?

397
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,363
Because we're planning
on arresting you.

398
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,127
For what?
The murder
of Lawrence Fuller.

399
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:29,999
Come on, Iet's not
make this any harder.

400
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:32,031
You have the right
to an attorney.

401
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:34,438
You want my advice,
don't take one that's
on your mother's payroll.

402
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,806
You're making a mistake.
My son is innocent.

403
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:38,276
You're the only
other suspect,

404
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,813
so if you got a confession,
now's the time to give it.

405
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:42,542
I'II have him out
by morning.

406
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:43,605
Kyle, don't say
anything.

407
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,708
I won't.

408
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,980
I'm getting you a Iawyer.
I'II take care of everything.

409
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:49,215
Don't tell them
anything.

Not guilty.

I'II hear the People
on bail.

416
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,702
The defendant has
unlimited financial means
at his disposal

417
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:12,007
and no business
or familial responsibilities.

418
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,014
We consider him to be
a flight risk and request
remand, Your Honor.

419
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:17,141
He is a 17-year-old boy

00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:19,743
with strong ties
to his stepmother
and his five-year-old sister.

he's not a flight risk,
Your Honor.

424

CABOT: The defendant
is charged with
viciously beating

his father to death
with a baseball bat.

426
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:33,894
This is a first arrest.
He is no hardened criminal.

427

Bail is set at $1,000,000,

and we'II also hold onto
Mr. Fuller's passport

of the trial.

Take him
all of five seconds

434
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:51,213
He didn't pull
this off alone.

435
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:55,619
Find me some evidence and
I will charge GIoria Stanfield
as a co-conspirator.

436
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,589
First place
I'd Iike to Iook
is her hotel room.

437
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,489
I can't send you
on a fishing expedition.

438
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,460
The judge is going to
want to know
what you're Iooking for.

439
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,359
Kyle's school uniform.

440
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,059
If he was wearing it
when he killed Fuller, it's
gotta have blood all over it.

441
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,728
He had to stash it
somewhere.

442
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:11,600
I'II get a warrant.

443
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:21,207
GIoria Stanfield's room,
please.

444
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:22,647
I'm sorry,
I can't give
that out.

445
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,775
This says
you can.

446
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:29,845
I can give you the room,
but she's not in right now.

447
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:31,720
Well, do you know
where she went?

448
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:35,353
DESK CLERK: I arranged for
a car to JFK. They didn't say
where they were going.

449
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,364
They? She had
her son with her?

450
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,900
He was young,
but I'm sure
he wasn't her son.

451
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,198
Not the way
they were acting.

452
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:46,203
Anything from
the passenger manifests?

453
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:49,674
We're calling on domestic
flights. There are over 70
airlines that fly out of JFK.

454
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,267
Well, there's no activity
on her credit card,

455
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:54,246
so if they flew,
they must've paid cash
for the tickets.

456
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:58,217
Departed on FIight 1647
to Dulles, 11:00 this morning.

457
00:21:58,285 --> 00:21:59,650
DC? What the hell
they doing there?

458
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,984
Thanks.
They're already back.

459
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:04,490
They Ianded at JFK
two hours ago.

460
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:07,353
The other officers
have already searched
the room.

461
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:08,918
How many times
do you need to see it?

462
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,827
Till we find
what we're Iooking for.

463
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:12,593
Don't worry about it.
The warrant's
still valid.

464
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,224
The guests may be inside.

465
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:16,826
You know what?
Let's surprise them.

466
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,473
BENSON: NYPD.
Come on out, Kyle.

467
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:24,841
KYLE: Don't come in here!

468
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,843
We got a warrant to search
this room, and we're going
to start with the bed.

469
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:33,648
Hey, you forget that
Iittle detail about
not Ieaving this jurisdiction?

470
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:35,484
You blew it, buddy.

471
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:37,551
We didn't do
anything wrong.

472
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,057
BENSON: Yeah, you did.

473
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,787
So get up, get dressed,

474
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,489
and have your Iawyer meet you
down at the station.

475
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:47,728
We don't have to say
anything to you.
We're married now.

476
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:00,738
Where's Kyle?

477
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:04,272
In a cell at the courthouse,
waiting for a judge
to revoke his bail,

478
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:05,648
send his ass to Rikers.

479
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,744
Explain this to me.

480
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:12,554
You're questioning my client
because she was in bed
with her husband?

481
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:15,459
Who, up until yesterday,
was her stepson.

482
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,225
You want to tell us again
how you never abused him,
GIoria?

483
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:20,423
SCHAEFER: He's 17 years old.
It's not abuse.

484
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:24,130
You expect us to believe
that she waited until it was
Iegal to sleep with him?

485
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:27,662
Well, unless you have evidence
to the contrary,
you have to believe it.

486
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,538
I never abused him.

487
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,268
We're in Iove.

488
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:35,907
You're in Iove with a boy
you've raised since
he was 10 years old?

489
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:38,816
Sweetheart,
that's not Iove,
that's pedophilia.

490
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:42,049
Nothing happened
until after he was 17.

491
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:43,555
A month ago.

492
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:48,061
You must've given him
one hell of a
birthday present, GIoria.

493
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,391
I'II take
the blame for it.

494
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,290
I was Ionely.

495
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:58,327
My husband was never home.
He hadn't touched me
in over a year.

496
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:00,903
Kyle knew I was hurt.

497
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:06,612
He only wants me to be happy,
and I want the same thing
for him.

498
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,308
What happened between us
may be wrong in your eyes,

499
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:11,442
but we can't help
the way we feel.

500
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:15,010
The detectives will explain
to you that you've done
nothing wrong at all.

501
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:18,285
You're not blood-related.
There's no crime.

502
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:20,920
So the widow Stanfield
marries her stepson

503
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:23,053
right in the middle
of a murder investigation.

504
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,691
Now neither one of them
has to testify against
each other in a court.

505
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,064
It's a huge coincidence.

506
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:32,003
Spousal privilege protects
the sanctity of marriage,
Detectives.

507
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:37,237
Well, it also protects them
from telling the truth about
who killed Lawrence Fuller.

508
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,477
During the course
of their investigation,

509
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:47,714
SVU detectives discovered
the defendant
Ieft his jurisdiction,

510
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:49,619
violating the conditions
of his bail agreement.

511
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,352
This was obviously
not an attempt to skip bail,
Your Honor,

512
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:55,554
as evidenced by the fact
that my client was on his way
back to New York

513
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:57,494
before the detectives
knew he was gone.

514
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,499
The sole purpose
of this trip was to travel
to the state of Virginia,

515
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,797
which allows non-residents
to obtain marriage Iicenses

516
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,600
without waiting periods
or blood tests.

517
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,371
He skipped town
to get married?

518
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:09,808
Virginia also allows
a person
under the age of 18

519
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:11,846
to marry with the permission
of a Iegal guardian,

520
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:15,440
despite the fact that
the defendant was, in fact,
marrying his Iegal guardian,

521
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:17,314
his stepmother,
GIoria Stanfield,

522
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:19,785
currently under investigation
for child abuse and murder.

523
00:25:19,854 --> 00:25:22,379
None of this is relevant
to the matter of bail,
Your Honor.

524
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:25,017
But it is relevant
to the defendant's trial.

525
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,618
This marriage is an attempt
to abuse spousal privilege

526
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:31,096
and circumvent the very
investigation which may Iand
the defendant in jail.

527
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:34,623
Whether or not the defendant
intended to avoid prosecution,

528
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:37,034
he violated
his bail agreement.

529
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:39,539
Bail is revoked.
Defendant is remanded.

530
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:42,599
Congratulations
on your nuptials,
young man.

531
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,749
CABOT: Get anything
from the blushing bride?

532
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:50,408
She's sticking
to her story.

533
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:53,147
Nothing happened
until after
he turned 17.

534
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:55,985
Cut her Ioose.
We sure the marriage
is valid?

535
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:57,991
According to the
Virginia State Attorney's
office.

536
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,994
There is nothing on the books
preventing a minor
from marrying a stepparent.

537
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:02,222
It's perfectly Iegal.

538
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:04,521
And newsworthy.

539
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:09,762
Did GIoria Stanfield
abuse her children?

540
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:12,305
Is the district attorney
planning to indict her
for her husband's murder?

541
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:13,362
CABOT: We have no comment.

542
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,908
Hey, does GIoria Stanfield's
pregnancy

543
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:16,568
have any effect on
the child abuse allegations?

544
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:17,668
Who told you that?

545
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,007
I'm not
at Iiberty to say.

546
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,377
Let me talk to you
a second.
Hey, hey, hey...

547
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,575
Right over here.
I won't reveal my sources.

548
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:26,313
You know what?
Don't give me
this intimidation crap.

549
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:28,651
First Amendment, kids.
I'm a journalist.

550
00:26:28,723 --> 00:26:31,624
For the National Probe.
That's a real
respectable publication.

551
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:34,093
You guys are just pissed
because I got the goods
before you.

552
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:35,959
What'd you do?
Stake out her
doctor's office?

553
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,827
Bribe some receptionist
for her medical records?

554
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,367
AII I'm saying is,
she's knocked up.
Three months along.

555
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:42,198
And that stepson of hers
is the father.

556
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,396
How do you know that?

557
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,769
Because she brought him
with her to the appointment.

558
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,401
Use your brains, honey.
Why else would
she marry the kid?

559
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,614
Heard you're gonna be
a daddy. That true?

560
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:01,416
Don't answer that.
Why the hell not?

561
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:04,390
Whatever his answer is,
it doesn't incriminate him,
just his mother.

562
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:05,756
GIoria is my wife.

563
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:07,920
Look at him.
Know what that is?

564
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:09,054
Fatherly pride.

565
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,256
FIN: Kid's yours, then?

566
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:14,734
My client has no way
of knowing the paternity
of GIoria Stanfield's child.

567
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:16,667
But it's possible,
right?

568
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:20,196
Ask him something
he can actually answer
or we're done.

569
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:25,035
Did she tell you
that was your baby?
Is that why you got married?

570
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:31,318
Anything GIoria told me was
after we were married.

571
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:34,616
That means
I don't have to
answer your question.

572
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:44,025
Thank you, Detective Benson.
And they say chivalry's dead.

573
00:27:44,632 --> 00:27:48,033
You shopping for
your husband's funeral
or maternity clothes?

574
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,296
Little bit of both.

575
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,304
We wanted to offer
our congratulations
to you.

576
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,862
And you're bringing me
a present.

577
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,398
Yep. Paternity test
paid for by the state.

578
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:58,501
Why?

579
00:27:58,579 --> 00:27:59,944
I think
you can guess.

580
00:28:00,014 --> 00:28:02,881
So you can prove
I had sex with Kyle
before he was 17.

581
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,008
Do I have a choice?

582
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:05,677
You can wait
until the baby is born.

583
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:06,742
We can get a court order,

584
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:08,652
but that means you have
six more months of visits

585
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:11,317
to Iook forward to
from Detective Benson
and myself

586
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,882
just to make sure
you don't get Iost.

587
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,485
Contact my attorney.
He'II set up the test.

588
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:23,194
Congratulations.
It's a boy.

589
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:24,898
Not what we
wanted to know.

590
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:26,667
Makes the paternity testing
a Iot easier.

591
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:28,834
Only have to compare
the Y-chromosomes.

592
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,673
Got Lawrence Fuller's
DNA from the morgue.

593
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:32,542
He and Kyle
have the same Y.

594
00:28:32,613 --> 00:28:33,807
Then so should
the baby.

595
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,849
No. Chromosomes
don't match.

596
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,111
Benson.

597
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,185
Somebody else
is the father.

598
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:41,346
Thanks.

599
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:45,715
You're not gonna
believe this.

600
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:49,559
GIoria Stanfield
is in the hospital.
She's been raped.

601
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:54,165
DOCTOR: Came in by ambulance
about an hour ago.

602
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,533
Contusions to her thighs
and upper arms.

603
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,265
Rape kit
was positive
for fluids.

604
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,863
She Iose
consciousness?

605
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:02,375
Awake for the whole thing.
He hit her hard.

606
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:04,274
Bruising's pretty severe.

607
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:06,506
No sign of trauma
to the baby.

608
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,606
We're keeping her overnight
for observation.

609
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:09,877
Thanks.

610
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:23,419
Who did this to you,
GIoria?

611
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:25,125
I don't know.

612
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:31,299
You gonna tell us
some stranger just crawled in
through your window?

613
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:34,936
Forget it, GIoria.

614
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:39,503
You know who did it
because you were
sleeping with him.

615
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,208
Every word
out of your mouth
has been a Iie.

616
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:44,183
Now, you want our help,
you give us his name

617
00:29:44,252 --> 00:29:46,311
and you give it to us now.

618
00:29:52,794 --> 00:29:56,457
Frank Barbarossa. I did...
I had a stupid fling with him.

619
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:57,589
I ended it months ago.

620
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:58,927
I thought he was over it,

621
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,902
and all this time
he was just thinking up
ways to hurt me.

622
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,131
He the father of your baby?

623
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:07,496
Mmm-hmm.

624
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:15,847
When he found out
that I married Kyle,
he went crazy.

625
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:21,915
I really did think that Kyle
killed his father. I was just
trying to protect him.

626
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,617
But now you think differently.
You think this

627
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,058
Frank murdered
your husband.

628
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:29,391
Yes.

629
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:33,089
He said it was my fault.

630
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:35,499
That if I keep
playing games with people,

631
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,698
sooner or Iater
that I was going to
have to pay.

632
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,934
And that
if I couldn't understand that,

633
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:44,910
that he would
do the same thing to me
that he did to Lawrence.

634
00:30:58,594 --> 00:30:59,754
Frank Barbarossa?

635
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:00,920
Who are you?

636
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:03,191
Police, Frankie.
You're under arrest.

637
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:04,289
What are you
arresting me for?

638
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:05,594
Raping GIoria Stanfield.

639
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,101
Rape? Wait a minute.
She was raped?

640
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,194
And beaten, tough guy.

641
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:11,171
That why you pump iron?
So you can mess up women?

642
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,401
No, no,
you guys are making a mistake,
you're making a mistake.

643
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:15,568
I didn't... I didn't rape her.
I didn't rape her.

644
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:19,637
Then I'm glad we got
your DNA so we can clear
your good name.

645
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,180
FIN: No record.
The guy's a personal trainer.

646
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:26,119
Three of his clients Iive in
GIoria Stanfield's building.

647
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:27,348
She one of them?
No.

648
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:28,855
But he was there
the night of the murder.

649
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:31,552
Doorman didn't mention it
because Barbarossa's
in the building all the time.

650
00:31:31,627 --> 00:31:33,891
He checked in at 7:30,
out by 9:10.

651
00:31:34,263 --> 00:31:35,457
To see who?

652
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,794
According to this,
one of his clients,
Greta Zabor.

653
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:39,993
But she says
the training session
ended in an hour.

654
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,969
Which Ieaves half an hour
unaccounted for.

655
00:31:48,343 --> 00:31:49,332
What happened to GIoria?

656
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:51,572
Ah, one of those guys
who Iikes to relive it.

657
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:53,080
Yeah. AII right.

658
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:55,446
Legs, arms.

659
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:56,541
Didn't touch
the face, though,

660
00:31:56,618 --> 00:32:00,418
because what fun is it
to rape a movie star if you
can't recognize her, right?

661
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:04,788
Oh, my God.
What's the matter, Frankie?

662
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,886
You can't stand
the sight of
your own work?

663
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:09,328
No, I didn't do this.

664
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:11,366
I Iove her, okay?
I would never Iay
a hand on her.

665
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:12,559
Where were you
Iast night?

666
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,862
FRANK: I was home.

667
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:15,028
Anyone confirm that?

668
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:16,866
No, no. I Iive alone.

669
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:19,806
Look, why do you guys think
this was me?

670
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,570
Because she fingered you.
FRANK: What?

671
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:22,667
MUNCH: She said that
you raped her

672
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:24,371
then threatened to kill her
Iike you killed her husband.

673
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,470
No, that's a Iie.

674
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:27,447
Read her statement, Frank.
We got you.

675
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:29,575
FIN: And we got your DNA
to match to the rape kit.

676
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:34,384
That alone will get you
12-and-a-half to 25 years of
personal training at Attica.

677
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:37,892
No, man. It ain't gonna match,
because I didn't rape her.

678
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,259
Of course
there's a murder conviction.
That's another 25-to-Iife.

679
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,231
Your parole officer
hasn't even been born yet.

680
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,233
Look, I'm telling you guys,
I didn't kill anybody.

681
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:47,598
Think about this,
Frankie.

682
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:50,433
The jury sees you,
the schmuck trainer
to the rich and famous.

683
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,939
You're jealous,
you want what they have.

684
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:55,772
So you knock up the actress,
kill the husband
and set up the son.

685
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:57,709
We got officers going through
your place right now.

686
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:58,871
You think they're gonna
find anything?

687
00:32:58,947 --> 00:33:00,244
Did you throw away
those shoes
you were wearing

688
00:33:00,315 --> 00:33:01,680
when you killed
that guy?

689
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,617
I hope so, because
blood is really
hard to rub off.

690
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:06,517
FIN: Damn near impossible.

691
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:10,650
That Iying bitch.

692
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:12,125
Tell me about it.

693
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,498
That bitch!
I'm gonna kill her!
Sit down!

694
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:22,299
No. No, you get me a Iawyer.
You get me a Iawyer.
I don't say anything.

695
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,098
Legal Aid's backed up.

696
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:28,074
Frankie won't have
representation
until tonight.

697
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:31,340
It doesn't matter. Once the
DNA comes back, no Iawyer's
gonna get him out of this.

698
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:34,644
Got the LUDs
on Barbarossa's cell.
Something interesting.

699
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:38,379
He got a call the night
of Fuller's murder at 8:40.

700
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:41,513
There's a missing half hour.
He's still someplace
inside that building.

701
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,217
Where was the call from?

702
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,521
BENSON: Pay phone
in the deli across the street.

703
00:33:45,594 --> 00:33:48,085
Odds are it's one
of two people,
GIoria or Kyle.

704
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:49,653
They were both out of
the apartment by then.

705
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:52,894
I doubt Kyle's gonna call
his wife's boyfriend.
It was her.

706
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:56,631
She calls Barbarossa
minutes before
he kills her husband.

707
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:57,763
Why?

708
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:00,105
Find out.

709
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,173
FIN: You know this woman?

710
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:07,078
Yeah, yeah. Seen her
in the neighborhood.

711
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:08,548
Real diva, that one.

712
00:34:08,617 --> 00:34:10,482
She ever been in here?

713
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:11,985
A few nights ago.

714
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:14,818
I asked her for
an autograph, she acted
Iike I was stalking her.

715
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,654
Screw her.
She's not that good
of an actress anyway.

716
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:20,092
What'd she come
in here for?

717
00:34:20,162 --> 00:34:22,756
Made a phone call
on the payphone,

718
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:24,924
then she watched out
the window
for a few minutes,

719
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,524
made one more call,
then Ieft.

720
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,863
What was going on
out the window?

721
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,426
I think she was waiting
for somebody

722
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,199
to come out of the building
across the street.

723
00:34:31,273 --> 00:34:33,138
You happen to eavesdrop
on those phone conversations?

724
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,005
No, man.
And I tried.

725
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:37,440
Thanks.

726
00:34:38,346 --> 00:34:39,506
We got your message.

727
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:41,742
There's something wrong
with our DNA sample?

728
00:34:41,817 --> 00:34:43,182
What did you do
to my sperm?

729
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,650
BENSON: Not a thing.

730
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,383
Somebody did, because
there's no way it came off
a rape victim. Look at this.

731
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:53,056
See how the tail
of each sperm is
bent at the tip?

732
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:54,595
Yeah. What does
that tell you?

733
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:56,187
This sperm was frozen.

734
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:57,993
So, unless your guy
was shooting
through ice cubes,

735
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:00,159
there's no way this semen
could have come from a rape.

736
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:01,327
Do we know
whose sperm it is?

737
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:02,495
Oh, it's your guy.

738
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:05,404
Frozen or not, the DNA
from the rape kit matched
the DNA from his towel

739
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:07,965
which matched
the paternity test.

740
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:09,806
There's another thing.

741
00:35:09,878 --> 00:35:13,109
The presence of spermicide
from the rape kit sample.

742
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:14,808
Like from a condom.

743
00:35:14,883 --> 00:35:18,614
That GIoria saved
after she had sex
with Frank Barbarossa.

744
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:22,646
She freezes it,
she plants it on herself
to set him up for rape.

745
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,824
And murder.

746
00:35:26,128 --> 00:35:27,288
You drop the rape charges,

747
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:30,559
he'II plead to murder two,
minimum sentencing
recommendation.

748
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:31,792
Why should we do that?

749
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:34,836
Because he's gonna give you
GIoria Stanfield.

750
00:35:36,538 --> 00:35:39,837
He agrees to testify
against her, assuming
we can corroborate his story,

751
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:41,842
and you've got a deal.

752
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:45,576
Go ahead.

753
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:48,043
The bitch set me up.

754
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:50,414
Frankie, just tell her
what you know, okay?

755
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:56,620
I'd have done
anything for her.

756
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:59,627
I didn't care about
the money and all that.

757
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,094
I killed the husband,
but I did it because
GIoria told me to.

758
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:07,432
CABOT: How did she
set up the murder?

759
00:36:08,738 --> 00:36:12,174
She called me that night,
and she said he was crazy,

760
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:15,938
and that if I didn't do it
right then, that he was
going to kill her.

761
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,309
Did she pay you?

762
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,575
That's not why I did it.

763
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:21,879
She said she was afraid
for her Iife.

764
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:24,784
He used to knock her
and those kids around
all the time.

765
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:27,516
If he was out of the way,
that we could be together,

766
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,716
but he'd never Iet her go.

767
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:33,251
Telling you about her
abusive husband doesn't mean
she asked you to kill him.

768
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,160
Well, how the hell you think
I got in the apartment?

769
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:36,459
She gave me
the security code.

770
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:37,863
That doesn't
prove anything.

771
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:38,958
Why the hell not?

772
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:40,297
Because you were
screwing her,

773
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,961
so she could have
given it to you
at any time.

774
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,699
Yeah, but she made up
a rape to frame me.

775
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:46,765
That proves that
she's a Iiar,
not a murderer.

776
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:47,866
The kid's baseball bat.

777
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:51,038
She told me where it was
and she told me what to do
with it when I was done.

778
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:53,172
It was her idea
to set him up, too.

779
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:55,774
Mr. Barbarossa,
with your statement
you are the only person

780
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:57,409
going to jail for this murder.

781
00:36:57,486 --> 00:36:59,716
I need something
I can prove.

782
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:13,232
Well, I guess she's gonna
get away with it.

783
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:18,339
We arresting her?

784
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:21,535
Nothing he said definitively
points to GIoria.

785
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,670
This might.
Dumped the payphone
from the deli.

786
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:26,476
That other call
that GIoria made
went to Kyle Fuller's cell.

787
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,278
Wonder what that
conversation entailed.

788
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:31,081
"Honey, get out of the house.
Your father's about
to get murdered."

789
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:33,587
Would explain
why he's sitting in Rikers.

790
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:35,419
He thinks she did it,
he's protecting her.

791
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:36,924
You get Kyle
to testify to that,

792
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:40,156
we've got corroboration
and an indictment
against GIoria.

793
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:41,753
When's Kyle
getting released?

794
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:44,459
I'm bringing Barbarossa's
confession before a judge
tomorrow morning

795
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:46,467
to formally drop the charges.

796
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,059
Kyle's a free man by noon.

797
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:49,468
And a dead man.

798
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:50,698
He cashes in that trust,

799
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:54,038
GIoria's got no reason
to keep him around anymore.

800
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:58,304
My client's being released
within the hour, Detective,

801
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:00,849
so I'm not quite sure
what we're doing here.

802
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:02,543
You know why
they're dropping
the charges?

803
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:03,676
Because I didn't
kill my father.

804
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:04,913
They tell you
who did?

805
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:07,547
Some guy that worked
in my apartment building.

806
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:09,250
No, not some guy.

807
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:12,253
Your stepmother's
boyfriend.

808
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:16,555
You think you can just
make up these Iies
and I'm gonna believe you?

809
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,293
You've been
sitting in prison
for one reason,

810
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:21,029
your stepmother
set you up for murder.

811
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:23,070
That's not true.

812
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,300
Kyle, think about it.

813
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:30,236
The weapon was
your baseball bat,
hidden under your bed.

814
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:32,304
And whose idea
was that?

815
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:34,179
It was your
stepmother's.

816
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,877
GIoria is my wife.

817
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:38,317
Who's having
another guy's baby.

818
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:49,995
STABLER: Results of
her paternity test.
See for yourself.

819
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,304
Kyle, there's no reason
to protect her anymore.

820
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:02,344
She doesn't deserve it.

821
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:09,875
It's not true.

822
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:15,086
Can't argue with DNA.

823
00:39:22,798 --> 00:39:26,234
BENSON: She had
her boyfriend
kill your father.

824
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:33,064
And he did it because GIoria
told him that they would
Iive happily ever after.

825
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:36,577
She said the same thing
to you, didn't she?

826
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:42,780
But you couldn't kill him,
and so she got someone else
to do it.

827
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,481
But she wanted
to get married to me.

828
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:48,682
It was her idea.

829
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:51,056
So you wouldn't testify
against her.

830
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:55,887
But I would have
protected her.
She didn't have to Iie.

831
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,600
She called you that night
before you Ieft the apartment.

832
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:01,568
What'd she say to you?

833
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,604
She told me to Ieave.

834
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:12,246
That she was gonna take care
of everything, and that after
that night we'd be together.

835
00:40:17,887 --> 00:40:19,912
She told me she Ioved me.

836
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,464
Hey, can I have
your autograph?

837
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:34,830
What, are you
following me?

838
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:36,235
We heard you made
an appointment.

839
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:40,831
Family planning services.
You're getting rid
of the baby, too.

840
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,810
Guess nobody's safe
around you.

841
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,185
Hey.

842
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:00,961
What are you doing?

843
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,295
Sweetheart, I told you
why I can't have the baby.

844
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:06,857
We agreed that this was
the best thing for us.

845
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:08,096
Right.

846
00:41:08,537 --> 00:41:10,300
KYLE: But you said
it was mine.

847
00:41:10,372 --> 00:41:13,569
Which proves
we were having sex
before I was 17.

848
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,611
Kyle, this is for us.

849
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,113
No, it's not.

850
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:22,876
Look, I know
the baby isn't mine.

851
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:27,412
So if you wanna kill it,
go ahead.
I don't care anymore.

852
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,650
Kyle, please.

853
00:41:28,724 --> 00:41:30,157
Just tell me something.

854
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:35,186
This whole time
we were together,
this whole year,

855
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,799
was it all
part of your plan?

856
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,360
Make me Iove you
so I would do
whatever you wanted?

857
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:43,700
Absolutely not.

858
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:47,469
Because if it was,
you didn't have to do that.

859
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,912
You didn't have to pretend.

860
00:41:51,947 --> 00:41:54,108
I already Ioved you, GIoria.

861
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:58,251
I can't remember
when I didn't.

862
00:41:58,621 --> 00:42:00,418
I do Iove you, Kyle.

863
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:02,648
We're married.

864
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:05,922
That's why I don't wanna have
another man's baby.

865
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:10,659
Look, I only Iied to you

866
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:14,567
because I thought you were
too young to understand.
It was my mistake.

867
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:17,071
I will not Iet that
happen again.

868
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,273
I had my Iawyer do this.

869
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,011
It's for you.
BENSON: Petition
for divorce, GIoria.

870
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:31,313
You're gonna be
a free woman.

871
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:34,754
Not for Iong, though.
You're under arrest
for murder.

872
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,214
You don't know
what you're doing, Kyle.

873
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:38,351
No.

874
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:42,295
I know exactly
what I'm doing,

875
00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:44,692
Mom.
