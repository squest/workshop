1
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:05,170
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:08,870
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:10,139
In New York City,

4
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:13,011
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:16,609
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,711
These are their stories.

7
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:22,818
So what kinds of things
do you Iike to draw, Chloe?

8
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:23,984
Cats.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,550
Cats?
I Iike cats.

10
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:31,462
You know, your teacher
showed me a really
great picture that you drew.

11
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:35,627
Is that your family?
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:37,373 --> 00:00:39,341
Are you
in this picture?

13
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:42,270
That's me
and that's Mommy
and Kyle.

14
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,005
You Iook sad
in this picture.
Are those tears?

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,347
Why are you crying?

16
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,884
Kyle is your brother?

17
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:56,891
He's my half-brother.

18
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:59,052
Oh, 'cause
you guys have
different moms, right?

19
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:01,187
We have the same daddy.
Daddy?

20
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:03,698
There's no daddy
in this picture.
Where's he?

21
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:04,960
He's out of town.

22
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:06,501
Is that
why you're sad?

23
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:07,695
No.

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,397
Okay. Chloe,

25
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:13,708
are you sad
'cause someone's
hurting you?

26
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:17,870
I don't know.

27
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:21,948
Usually Chloe's
very happy, outgoing,

28
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:23,883
but Iately
she's been withdrawn.

29
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:25,716
And I've noticed
some bruises
on her Iegs.

30
00:01:25,788 --> 00:01:27,949
Okay, once
Detective Benson's
finished talking with her

31
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:30,219
we'II need to take her
to the hospital
for an exam.

32
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:32,727
The father's
a Iittle high-strung.
What do I tell him?

33
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:35,286
We'II send an officer
here to meet him,
bring him to the hospital.

34
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:36,422
What do you mean,
high-strung?

35
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:40,265
A yeller. You know,
corporate mogul type,
Lawrence Fuller.

36
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,330
Fuller Telecom?
Yeah.

37
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:43,463
Guy's name
is on my cable bill.

38
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:47,737
Well, you should probably
also know that Chloe's
mother is GIoria Stanfield.

39
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,143
The actress.
She did a few movies
about 10 years ago.

40
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:52,476
So you're asking
for discretion.

41
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:55,278
No, I'm just giving you
fair warning.
They're both a handful.

42
00:01:55,852 --> 00:02:00,118
Chloe, your mom
and Kyle Iook
really happy here, huh?

43
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:04,392
How come you're
the only one
that's sad?

44
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,156
Because Mommy
Ioves Kyle
more than me.

45
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:10,695
I bet she Ioves you
both the same.

46
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:14,793
She reads him stories
all the time,
but not to me.

47
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:18,406
Where does she
read Kyle stories?

48
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,941
In his room.

49
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,402
They close the door
and I'm not allowed.

50
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:29,412
You never
went in there?
Not one time?

51
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:32,650
It was because
I heard noises.

52
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:35,583
I thought
Mommy was crying.

53
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,390
What were they doing?

54
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:42,825
They were
playing in bed.

55
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:48,895
They didn't have
any clothes on.

56
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:44,117
The colposcopic exam
didn't reveal any signs
of sexual abuse.

57
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:46,286
Anything that indicates
straight physical abuse?

58
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,761
Some bruises
on her shins.

59
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,991
Pretty typical
for a five-year-old.

60
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,261
Scan showed healed wrist
and tibia fractures,

61
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:55,065
but she doesn't remember
how she got them.

62
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:56,126
You talk
to the parents yet?

63
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,469
Actually, we're gonna wait
till we speak with Chloe.

64
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,944
Yeah, well, I think that's
her father, and he Iooks
Iike he wants to go.

65
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:07,213
Are you the detectives
who brought my daughter here?

66
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:09,012
Is she all right?
She's fine, Mr. Fuller.

67
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,315
Why don't we go someplace
where we can discuss it
more privately?

68
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:13,252
School tells me
I have to go
to the hospital.

69
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:15,586
No one tells me why.
Is Chloe hurt?

70
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:18,149
No. No, but there was
some concern
at her school.

71
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:19,626
Concern about what?

72
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:23,187
She said some things
that might indicate
problems at home.

73
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,358
What kind of problems?

74
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:27,527
Actually, we were hoping
that you could help us
with that.

75
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:30,333
When did Chloe
break her wrist
and her Ieg?

76
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:34,536
When she was three.
She fell off a slide
in a playground.

77
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:37,738
Is that what this is about?
It was an accident.

78
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,838
You dragged her
to a hospital for that?

79
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:43,407
We brought her here
based on a picture
she drew at school

80
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:46,387
and statements
she made to
Detective Benson

81
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,319
which seemed to

82
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:54,294
describe a sexual
relationship between
your wife and your son.

83
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:57,295
What are you
talking about?
What kind of picture?

84
00:04:57,366 --> 00:05:01,962
Your daughter said
she'd seen them sleeping
in the same bed together.

85
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:04,836
Are you out of your mind?
She's his mother.

86
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:07,398
BENSON: Do you think that
Chloe made it up?

87
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:09,871
She had to. I...

88
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:12,470
Where's your wife
now, Mr. Fuller?

89
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:14,573
Our house in the Hamptons,
antique shopping.

90
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,381
Have you ever seen
any behavior that
confirms Chloe's story?

91
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,382
I don't think so.

92
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:23,157
But you damn well better believe
I'II be finding out.

93
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:26,319
Sir, it's really
best if you allow us
to investigate.

94
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:29,694
You investigate all you Iike.
I'm taking Chloe home.

95
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:36,171
Kyle Fuller's school
records describe a normal,
well-adjusted kid,

96
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:38,832
till the second grade
when his mother was
killed in a car accident.

97
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,603
Not surprising
he had a tough time.

98
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:42,166
In the fifth grade
his behavior got worse.

99
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:45,475
Loss of appetite,
sudden outbursts,
fighting.

100
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:47,743
That was the same year
his father married
GIoria Stanfield.

101
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:49,648
Well, it could be
adjusting to a stepmother.

102
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,586
Or the stepmother
pulled a Woody AIIen
way back then.

103
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:55,624
Proving that's the only way
we're gonna charge her
with statutory rape.

104
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,818
It's not illegal to have
sex with a 17-year-old.

105
00:05:57,893 --> 00:05:59,417
He turned 17 Iast month.

106
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:02,020
You don't think
it's Iikely that the abuse
started Iong before that?

107
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:04,532
Doesn't matter what
I think if they're not
breaking the Iaw.

108
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,037
Even if the abuse started
yesterday, she's still
essentially his mother.

109
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,369
She's taking advantage
of her control over him.

110
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,069
Unless he's a normal teenager
who's just happy to be
banging an actress.

111
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:16,509
Look, if nothing else,

112
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,809
that environment
is unhealthy
for that Iittle girl.

113
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,679
Well, this all depends
on whether we believe
what she's saying is true.

114
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:22,775
BENSON: And I do.

115
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:26,151
Kids her age
don't usually make up
things Iike this.

116
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:30,585
When is the mother
due back in town?

117
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,354
Anytime, if she gets word
we're Iooking at her.

118
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:34,362
She's gonna want to circle
the family wagons.

119
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,422
Well, I'd Iike to know
if we have a complaining
witness before that happens.

120
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,832
Fin, you and John
go talk to Kyle.

121
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,837
If he is a victim, he may
want to know there's something
he can do to stop it.

122
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:46,204
You know, a family
Iike this probably has
plenty of hired help.

123
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,470
Something's going on
in that house,
they'd know about it.

124
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,034
AII right, discretion,
everybody.

125
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:52,774
The Ionger we keep this
out of the papers,
the better.

126
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:59,084
Kyle Fuller.
Can we talk to you
alone for a minute?

127
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:02,547
I'II see you guys Iater.
Yeah.

128
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:05,753
What's this about?

129
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:07,728
You talk to
your father today?

130
00:07:07,797 --> 00:07:10,766
No, I won't see him
till tonight. Why,
did something happen?

131
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,802
He's fine.
How things going
for you at home?

132
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:16,136
Okay. Why?

133
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,431
Get along with
your mother?

134
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,168
My stepmother?

135
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:22,938
She's all right.
Why are you asking
about her?

136
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:25,606
One of our detectives
talked to your sister Chloe.

137
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,410
We're with the
Special Victims Unit.

138
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:30,646
One of the things
we investigate
is child abuse.

139
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,146
You think Chloe's
being abused?

140
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:35,019
FIN: No, not Chloe. You.

141
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:37,351
She told you that?

142
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:41,021
She said you and your
stepmother sleep
in the same bed. Is that true?

143
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:44,793
Okay, wait.

144
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,995
Wait. If you think
that we're sleeping together,

145
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:52,098
Iike, having sex,
that's just sick.

146
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:55,541
I mean, GIoria's been
my stepmom since I was,
Iike, 10.

147
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:58,478
And you don't wanna
get her into trouble.
We understand that.

148
00:07:58,547 --> 00:08:02,574
No. It's just that
there's no way that
we're sleeping together

149
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:04,243
or having sex
or anything.

150
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,689
I mean, if that's
what Chloe told you,
Iook, I'm sorry, I really am.

151
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:11,225
I'm sorry you came down here
and wasted your time,

152
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,454
but it's just not true.

153
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,124
Okay?

154
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:23,795
Detectives,
I've told you three times,

155
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:27,468
my employment contract
includes a
confidentiality clause.

156
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,704
Meaning
you know something,
you just can't say.

157
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:31,075
That's not what I mean.

158
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:32,909
Do you get along with
Ms. Stanfield?

159
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:35,815
She's an excellent employer,
and that's all I will say.

160
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:37,580
Well, what do they
pay you for
a gig Iike this?

161
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:39,348
That's none
of your concern.

162
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:42,413
I'II bet there are
a Iot of under-the-table
cash transactions.

163
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,685
Is that true?

164
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,057
Well, we could find out.
Drop a dime to the IRS,

165
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:49,564
have them go through
your undeclared cash income
with a fine-toothed comb.

166
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,532
That would jam her up for,
what, about three years?

167
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,794
Minimum.

168
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,231
We find truth in
what Chloe is saying,
your boss is going down.

169
00:08:57,306 --> 00:09:00,742
You'd better
decide right now.
You want to join her?

170
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:05,806
I saw them together once,
a few weeks ago.

171
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,246
Doing what?

172
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,351
I walked into the room.

173
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:12,114
She was kissing Kyle.

174
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:13,381
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

175
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:16,322
It wasn't the way
a mother kisses her son.

176
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,122
Benson.
It was only a moment.

177
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:20,491
I hardly saw anything.

178
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,053
It sounds Iike
you saw plenty.

179
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:23,359
BENSON: Thanks.

180
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,027
GIoria Stanfield's
back in town.
At her Iawyer's office.

181
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,502
Our presence
is kindly requested.

182
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:36,704
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Detectives.

183
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,646
You must know my client,
GIoria Stanfield.

184
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,839
Heard a Iot about you.

185
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,044
GLORIA: I'II be with you
in a minute.

186
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:48,351
She wanted to clear
this matter up as soon
as she got back to town.

187
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:49,448
STABLER: How were
the Hamptons?

188
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:50,617
Dull.

189
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:54,521
I know the other detectives
already spoke to Kyle.

190
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:55,689
He told you the truth.

191
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:59,222
I am not having
a sexual relationship
with my stepson.

192
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:03,166
What more
can I tell you?

193
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:05,206
You think Chloe
Iied about it?

194
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:09,040
I think she
makes up stories.
She's a child.

195
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,341
Well, then,
why do we have
other adult witnesses

196
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:15,474
who describe
a pretty passionate kiss
between you and your stepson?

197
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:17,644
I kiss everyone,
Detective.

198
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,650
The simple fact
is you're investigating

199
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,920
the misconception of
an imaginative five-year-old.

200
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:27,596
Where do you think
Chloe got these ideas from?

201
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:31,030
Television, probably.
My old movies,
for that matter.

202
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:33,995
You know, this is
really ridiculous.

203
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:37,698
Chloe draws a picture,
and everyone blows it
out of proportion.

204
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:41,038
I would never do anything
to hurt my stepson.

205
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:45,875
No complaining witness,
no physical evidence of abuse,

206
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:50,112
no independent verification
other than an
uncooperative housekeeper

207
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:52,915
who saw a stepmother
kiss her stepson.

208
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,718
And no indictment
based on a
kindergartner's art project.

209
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,986
There's something
going on in that house.

210
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,118
That woman's wrong.

211
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,889
We're gonna need more
than your gut.

212
00:11:00,963 --> 00:11:03,454
I can contact my counterpart
at Children's Services.

213
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,500
At the very Ieast,
they can start
a file on GIoria.

214
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,967
I just got a call
from a patrol
out of the 22

215
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:10,801
responding to
a domestic disturbance
at the Formby Day School.

216
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:11,999
What happened?

217
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:15,976
GIoria and her husband
are fighting over
who's taking the daughter.

218
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:17,672
You Iet me take
my daughter home
right now

219
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,976
or I will slap a Iawsuit
on you so fast...
Don't Iet him near her.

220
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,778
You see
how angry he gets.

221
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,909
Shut up.
She raped my son.

222
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:26,113
God knows what she did
to my daughter.
Our daughter.

223
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:28,679
Look, you don't deserve
to be a mother.
You're disgusting.

224
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:29,951
Yeah, make up
some more stories.

225
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:33,051
Everyone knows it's so you can
get out of child support
when I divorce you!

226
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:36,291
I'm gonna kill you
if you touch my children!
Mr. Fuller!

227
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:39,596
I don't want to hear
another threat Iike that.
Now, am I clear?

228
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:42,102
Yeah.
You say I'm the abuser.

229
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:46,369
He hits me and he hits them.
You should investigate that!

230
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:48,467
You two
can fight this out
in Family Court.

231
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:50,876
Until then,
your children will be
in the custody of the state.

232
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:52,379
What?
You can't do that!

233
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:55,281
If we think your children
are in imminent danger,
we certainly can.

234
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,979
If they keep at it,
bring them in
for disorderly conduct.

235
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,215
FULLER: Oh, no, no, no.
Chloe, sweetheart.

236
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,279
Wait a minute.

237
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:03,648
Baby.

238
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:04,784
FULLER: No.
It's okay.

239
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,259
This is kidnapping!

240
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:09,764
Munch, I need you to do
an emergency removal
of Kyle Fuller.

241
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,197
Pick him up at his school.

242
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,200
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

243
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,105
You guys are friends
of Kyle Fuller, right?

244
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:19,663
You seen him?

245
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,835
He Ieft already.
What are you guys
investigating?

246
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,675
Kyle get along okay
with his family?
His stepmom?

247
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,181
Yeah, he and GIoria
got along really well.

248
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:28,477
How do you know?

249
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,575
Well, everybody knows
about GIoria.

250
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,916
She's very open.

251
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:35,118
What, is she putting out
for all his school buddies?

252
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,023
Not that. She just Iikes
having guys around.

253
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:39,560
She doesn't mind,
you know,
if you Iook at her.

254
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,324
Yeah, it's Iike she's
wearing clothes, but you can
totally see through them.

255
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:44,524
And she's always giving
everybody backrubs.

256
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,726
And what does
Kyle think of all this?

257
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:46,961
He digs it.

258
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,764
It's not his real mom,
so who cares?

259
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,771
It sounds Iike you think
there's more going on

260
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,774
than just backrubs
and peep shows.

261
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:57,778
I don't know
if he's banging her,
but I wouldn't be surprised.

262
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:03,241
Where's the Iittle one?

263
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,718
ACS placed her
with an aunt
and uncle in the area.

264
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:08,518
Well, Iet's all hope
insanity isn't
a family trait.

265
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,818
Any Iuck with Kyle?

266
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:11,291
No. Not at home,
not with friends.

267
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,456
Munch and Fin are still
out Iooking, and your day
isn't over yet.

268
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:27,639
Doorman called it in.
No witnesses.
Nobody heard a struggle.

269
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,233
Where's the rest
of the Addams family?

270
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:30,938
MIA.
Forced entry?

271
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:33,277
Door was ajar,
Iocks intact.

272
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:36,943
Whoever did this
knew the security code.
There's no apparent robbery.

273
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,283
Bashed in
his skull, Ieft.

274
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:51,096
BIow to the back of the head's
probably what did it,

275
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,727
but he's got impact
wounds to the torso,
thighs, forearms.

276
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:55,963
Went down fighting.

277
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:59,405
Murder weapon Iooks Iike
it's cylindrical, two
or three inches in diameter.

278
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:00,736
MUNCH: Like a baseball bat?

279
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,174
That'd do it.

280
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:05,436
I found it
under Kyle's bed.
I'II bag it for prints.

281
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:09,314
Fin's talking to
the doorman to see
if Kyle Ieft in a hurry.

282
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:11,375
Mr. Fuller came in
around 8:00.

283
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:14,149
After about 20 minutes,
Ms. Stanfield Ieft,

284
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:16,691
then Kyle about
15 minutes Iater.

285
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:19,522
Did you notice
anything unusual
about either of them?

286
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:22,462
Ms. Stanfield
was in a hurry,
but that's typical.

287
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:25,967
Kyle. I guess
he seemed a Iittle upset.

288
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,292
Where are
the other entrances?

289
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,394
Back and side doors,

290
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:31,996
but they're all Iocked
and hooked up
to the alarm system.

291
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:34,702
And no one enters
without signing in.

292
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:38,007
Pretty quiet today.
Nobody out of the ordinary.

293
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,775
Just guests of the tenants.

294
00:14:39,848 --> 00:14:42,578
Okay. I'm gonna
get this back to you, okay?

295
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,218
What's going on?

296
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,916
Your father was killed.

297
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:53,425
Somebody attacked him
in your apartment.
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:56,926
Where's GIoria?

299
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,968
Well, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

300
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:02,663
You're taking
your father's death
kind of well, though.

301
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:04,103
Come on.

302
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,605
It's my day off.

303
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:08,199
I stopped by
to check on
Ms. Stanfield

304
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,438
and the front door was open.

305
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:13,481
I came in,
found Mr. Fuller.

306
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:15,743
Why were you
checking on
Ms. Stanfield?

307
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:18,012
She called
after you took Chloe.

308
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:21,749
She was so upset.
I wanted to make sure
she was all right.

309
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:23,489
You know where
she was calling from?

310
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:25,321
I assumed here.

311
00:15:25,394 --> 00:15:28,227
There was no one else
in the apartment.

312
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:31,960
She couldn't have done this,
Detective. It's not possible.

313
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:35,226
MUNCH: How'd you get
that shiner?

314
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:36,703
At school, in Phys Ed.

315
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:38,296
It Iooks Iike
you got punched.

316
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:39,465
Thought it might be
your dad.

317
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,565
MUNCH: Is that what happened?

318
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:42,371
He started to hit you
and you defended yourself?

319
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:43,502
No.

320
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:45,874
I didn't kill him.

321
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:47,313
Any idea who did?

322
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,651
Where'd you go tonight?

323
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:54,577
For a walk.

324
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:55,680
MUNCH: Why?

325
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:54,122
Because I felt Iike it.

326
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,422
Your dad and stepmom
were home
before you Ieft.

327
00:15:56,494 --> 00:16:00,055
That's gotta be a pretty
contentious relationship
these days, huh?

328
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:01,792
I don't know anything
about it.

329
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,063
Okay, you went out
for a walk.
Where'd GIoria go?

330
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:06,932
She didn't kill him.

331
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,099
FIN: Well, how do you know?
You went out for a walk.

332
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:13,266
I just know.

333
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:15,575
How many school uniforms
do you have?

334
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:19,642
About six.
Where's the one
you wore today?

335
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:21,049
I changed when I got home.

336
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:24,577
BIood stains kind of clash
with the school colors, huh?

337
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,852
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

338
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,257
Detectives.

339
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:39,269
Hold off
on the questions
for a minute.

340
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,328
Why?
Kid Iawyered up.

341
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:47,868
Mr. Schaefer,
if you'II follow me
to interrogation.

342
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:51,575
You're not worried about
a conflict of interest there,
Counselor?

343
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,549
Ms. Stanfield
is a suspect also.

344
00:16:53,618 --> 00:16:56,553
If charges are filed,
Kyle obtains new counsel.

345
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:59,385
Until then,
no conflict.

346
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:00,890
Who's representing you?

347
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,484
I'II answer any questions
you have without
my attorney present.

348
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,290
I'm gonna advise you
against that.

349
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:08,730
No. Really, it's okay.
I haven't got anything
to hide.

350
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,324
Right this way.

351
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:15,236
I have no idea what happened.
I went to a hotel tonight.

352
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:16,466
STABLER: Why?

353
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,168
You saw my husband
at the school.

354
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:21,337
Do you honestly think
I wanted to be anywhere
near that man?

355
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:23,643
BENSON: Well, then
why go home at all?

356
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:26,548
Well, Detective Benson,
to get my things.

357
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:28,444
My stepson was there.

358
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,489
I tried to explain to him
what was happening.

359
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:33,957
Kyle got so angry,

360
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,016
and then Lawrence walked in.

361
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,755
They started fighting.

362
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:40,889
Lawrence got physical,
as usual, pushed him.

363
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:43,126
I couldn't stand it
anymore so I Ieft.

364
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:46,568
You Ieft your husband
to push around your stepson?

365
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:48,469
How would I stop him?

366
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:52,302
Believe me, I've tried.
It only makes things worse.

367
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:55,278
Will the hotel
confirm your story?

368
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:58,474
The Sienna.
They'II tell you
when I checked in.

369
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,074
Is that all?

370
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:01,277
One more thing.

371
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,347
Was your husband
still breathing
when you Ieft?

372
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,653
I didn't kill him.

373
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:11,420
I have no reason.

374
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:13,623
Well, actually,
I could think of a couple.

375
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:15,825
Custody of the kids.
Inheriting his money.

376
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,767
Lawrence made me sign
a prenuptial agreement.

377
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:22,432
He always believed
that I was a gold digger
at heart.

378
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:28,446
The money goes to
Kyle and Chloe in trusts that
I am not allowed to touch.

379
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:32,108
So when you Ieft
Kyle and his father
were still fighting?

380
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,182
Kyle didn't do this.

381
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,982
But you'd already Ieft,
so you don't know
that for sure.

382
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:39,853
Look, I will answer
any questions
that you have about me,

383
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:42,859
but I just Iost my husband
and my daughter.

384
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:46,293
I'm not gonna help you
frame my stepson.

385
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:49,666
CABOT: Anyone Iook good
for the arrest?

386
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:53,101
Well, one's covering
for the other.
I'm just not sure who.

387
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:55,264
The murder weapon was found
under the boy's bed.

388
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,865
I'm guessing GIoria Stanfield
doesn't have a baseball bat.

389
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:00,001
Well, doesn't mean
she didn't borrow it.

390
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,602
Kyle came back
to the crime scene.

391
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,670
If he killed the guy,
why the hell
didn't he stay away?

392
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:07,741
Maybe to pick up
the murder weapon.
Only one set of prints on it.

393
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:10,611
Kyle Fuller's.

394
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:13,155
Arrest him.

395
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:18,255
We have been more than
cooperative, so if you're not
planning on arresting Kyle...

396
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:19,921
Stand up.
Why?

397
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:21,363
Because we're planning
on arresting you.

398
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:23,127
For what?
The murder
of Lawrence Fuller.

399
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:25,999
Come on, Iet's not
make this any harder.

400
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:28,031
You have the right
to an attorney.

401
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:30,438
You want my advice,
don't take one that's
on your mother's payroll.

402
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,806
You're making a mistake.
My son is innocent.

403
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,276
You're the only
other suspect,

404
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:36,813
so if you got a confession,
now's the time to give it.

405
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,542
I'II have him out
by morning.

406
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:39,605
Kyle, don't say
anything.

407
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:40,708
I won't.

408
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:42,980
I'm getting you a Iawyer.
I'II take care of everything.

409
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:45,215
Don't tell them
anything.

00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:01,329
Not guilty.

I'II hear the People
on bail.

416
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:05,702
The defendant has
unlimited financial means
at his disposal

417
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:08,007
and no business
or familial responsibilities.

418
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,014
We consider him to be
a flight risk and request
remand, Your Honor.

419
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:13,141
He is a 17-year-old boy

00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:15,743
with strong ties
to his stepmother
and his five-year-old sister.

he's not a flight risk,
Your Honor.

424

CABOT: The defendant
is charged with
viciously beating

425

his father to death
with a baseball bat.

426
00:20:27,198 --> 00:20:29,894
This is a first arrest.
He is no hardened criminal.

427
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:31,868
Bail is set at $1,000,000,

428

and we'II also hold onto
Mr. Fuller's passport

of the trial.

Take him
all of five seconds

434
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:47,213
He didn't pull
this off alone.

435
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:51,619
Find me some evidence and
I will charge GIoria Stanfield
as a co-conspirator.

436
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:53,589
First place
I'd Iike to Iook
is her hotel room.

437
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:55,489
I can't send you
on a fishing expedition.

438
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,460
The judge is going to
want to know
what you're Iooking for.

439
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:59,359
Kyle's school uniform.

440
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,059
If he was wearing it
when he killed Fuller, it's
gotta have blood all over it.

441
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:05,728
He had to stash it
somewhere.

442
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:07,600
I'II get a warrant.

443
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:17,207
GIoria Stanfield's room,
please.

444
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:18,647
I'm sorry,
I can't give
that out.

445
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:20,775
This says
you can.

446
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,845
I can give you the room,
but she's not in right now.

447
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:27,720
Well, do you know
where she went?

448
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:31,353
DESK CLERK: I arranged for
a car to JFK. They didn't say
where they were going.

449
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:34,364
They? She had
her son with her?

450
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:36,900
He was young,
but I'm sure
he wasn't her son.

451
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:39,198
Not the way
they were acting.

452
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:42,203
Anything from
the passenger manifests?

453
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:45,674
We're calling on domestic
flights. There are over 70
airlines that fly out of JFK.

454
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:47,267
Well, there's no activity
on her credit card,

455
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:50,246
so if they flew,
they must've paid cash
for the tickets.

456
00:21:50,315 --> 00:21:54,217
Departed on FIight 1647
to Dulles, 11:00 this morning.

457
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:55,650
DC? What the hell
they doing there?

458
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,984
Thanks.
They're already back.

459
00:21:58,056 --> 00:22:00,490
They Ianded at JFK
two hours ago.

460
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:03,353
The other officers
have already searched
the room.

461
00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:04,918
How many times
do you need to see it?

462
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:06,827
Till we find
what we're Iooking for.

463
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:08,593
Don't worry about it.
The warrant's
still valid.

464
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,224
The guests may be inside.

465
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:12,826
You know what?
Let's surprise them.

466
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,473
BENSON: NYPD.
Come on out, Kyle.

467
00:22:19,544 --> 00:22:20,841
KYLE: Don't come in here!

468
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,843
We got a warrant to search
this room, and we're going
to start with the bed.

469
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,648
Hey, you forget that
Iittle detail about
not Ieaving this jurisdiction?

470
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:31,484
You blew it, buddy.

471
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:33,551
We didn't do
anything wrong.

472
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:35,057
BENSON: Yeah, you did.

473
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:36,787
So get up, get dressed,

474
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:39,489
and have your Iawyer meet you
down at the station.

475
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:43,728
We don't have to say
anything to you.
We're married now.

476
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:56,738
Where's Kyle?

477
00:22:56,814 --> 00:23:00,272
In a cell at the courthouse,
waiting for a judge
to revoke his bail,

478
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:01,648
send his ass to Rikers.

479
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,744
Explain this to me.

480
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:08,554
You're questioning my client
because she was in bed
with her husband?

481
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,459
Who, up until yesterday,
was her stepson.

482
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:14,225
You want to tell us again
how you never abused him,
GIoria?

483
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,423
SCHAEFER: He's 17 years old.
It's not abuse.

484
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:20,130
You expect us to believe
that she waited until it was
Iegal to sleep with him?

485
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:23,662
Well, unless you have evidence
to the contrary,
you have to believe it.

486
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,538
I never abused him.

487
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:28,268
We're in Iove.

488
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:31,907
You're in Iove with a boy
you've raised since
he was 10 years old?

489
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:34,816
Sweetheart,
that's not Iove,
that's pedophilia.

490
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:38,049
Nothing happened
until after he was 17.

491
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:39,555
A month ago.

492
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:44,061
You must've given him
one hell of a
birthday present, GIoria.

493
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:48,391
I'II take
the blame for it.

494
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:50,290
I was Ionely.

495
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:54,327
My husband was never home.
He hadn't touched me
in over a year.

496
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:56,903
Kyle knew I was hurt.

497
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:02,612
He only wants me to be happy,
and I want the same thing
for him.

498
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,308
What happened between us
may be wrong in your eyes,

499
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:07,442
but we can't help
the way we feel.

500
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:11,010
The detectives will explain
to you that you've done
nothing wrong at all.

501
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:14,285
You're not blood-related.
There's no crime.

502
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:16,920
So the widow Stanfield
marries her stepson

503
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:19,053
right in the middle
of a murder investigation.

504
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,691
Now neither one of them
has to testify against
each other in a court.

505
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,064
It's a huge coincidence.

506
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:28,003
Spousal privilege protects
the sanctity of marriage,
Detectives.

507
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:33,237
Well, it also protects them
from telling the truth about
who killed Lawrence Fuller.

508
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,477
During the course
of their investigation,

509
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:43,714
SVU detectives discovered
the defendant
Ieft his jurisdiction,

510
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:45,619
violating the conditions
of his bail agreement.

511
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,352
This was obviously
not an attempt to skip bail,
Your Honor,

512
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:51,554
as evidenced by the fact
that my client was on his way
back to New York

513
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,494
before the detectives
knew he was gone.

514
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:56,499
The sole purpose
of this trip was to travel
to the state of Virginia,

515
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:58,797
which allows non-residents
to obtain marriage Iicenses

516
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,600
without waiting periods
or blood tests.

517
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,371
He skipped town
to get married?

518
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:06,808
Virginia also allows
a person
under the age of 18

519
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:08,846
to marry with the permission
of a Iegal guardian,

520
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:12,440
despite the fact that
the defendant was, in fact,
marrying his Iegal guardian,

521
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,314
his stepmother,
GIoria Stanfield,

522
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:16,785
currently under investigation
for child abuse and murder.

523
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:19,379
None of this is relevant
to the matter of bail,
Your Honor.

524
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:22,017
But it is relevant
to the defendant's trial.

525
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:24,618
This marriage is an attempt
to abuse spousal privilege

526
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:28,096
and circumvent the very
investigation which may Iand
the defendant in jail.

527
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:31,623
Whether or not the defendant
intended to avoid prosecution,

528
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:34,034
he violated
his bail agreement.

529
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:36,539
Bail is revoked.
Defendant is remanded.

530
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:39,599
Congratulations
on your nuptials,
young man.

531
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:45,749
CABOT: Get anything
from the blushing bride?

532
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:47,408
She's sticking
to her story.

533
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:50,147
Nothing happened
until after
he turned 17.

534
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:52,985
Cut her Ioose.
We sure the marriage
is valid?

535
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:53,991
According to the
Virginia State Attorney's
office.

536
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,994
There is nothing on the books
preventing a minor
from marrying a stepparent.

537
00:25:57,062 --> 00:25:58,222
It's perfectly Iegal.

538
00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:00,521
And newsworthy.

539
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,762
Did GIoria Stanfield
abuse her children?

540
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:08,305
Is the district attorney
planning to indict her
for her husband's murder?

541
00:26:08,373 --> 00:26:09,362
CABOT: We have no comment.

542
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:10,908
Hey, does GIoria Stanfield's
pregnancy

543
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:12,568
have any effect on
the child abuse allegations?

544
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:13,668
Who told you that?

545
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:15,007
I'm not
at Iiberty to say.

546
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,377
Let me talk to you
a second.
Hey, hey, hey...

547
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,575
Right over here.
I won't reveal my sources.

548
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:22,313
You know what?
Don't give me
this intimidation crap.

549
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:24,651
First Amendment, kids.
I'm a journalist.

550
00:26:24,723 --> 00:26:27,624
For the National Probe.
That's a real
respectable publication.

551
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:30,093
You guys are just pissed
because I got the goods
before you.

552
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:31,959
What'd you do?
Stake out her
doctor's office?

553
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,827
Bribe some receptionist
for her medical records?

554
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:36,367
AII I'm saying is,
she's knocked up.
Three months along.

555
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:38,198
And that stepson of hers
is the father.

556
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,396
How do you know that?

557
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:41,769
Because she brought him
with her to the appointment.

558
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,401
Use your brains, honey.
Why else would
she marry the kid?

559
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,614
Heard you're gonna be
a daddy. That true?

560
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:57,416
Don't answer that.
Why the hell not?

561
00:26:57,489 --> 00:27:00,390
Whatever his answer is,
it doesn't incriminate him,
just his mother.

562
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:01,756
GIoria is my wife.

563
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:03,920
Look at him.
Know what that is?

564
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,054
Fatherly pride.

565
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,256
FIN: Kid's yours, then?

566
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:10,734
My client has no way
of knowing the paternity
of GIoria Stanfield's child.

567
00:27:10,802 --> 00:27:12,667
But it's possible,
right?

568
00:27:12,738 --> 00:27:16,196
Ask him something
he can actually answer
or we're done.

569
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:21,035
Did she tell you
that was your baby?
Is that why you got married?

570
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:27,318
Anything GIoria told me was
after we were married.

571
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,616
That means
I don't have to
answer your question.

572
00:27:36,328 --> 00:27:40,025
Thank you, Detective Benson.
And they say chivalry's dead.

573
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:44,033
You shopping for
your husband's funeral
or maternity clothes?

574
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:45,296
Little bit of both.

575
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,304
We wanted to offer
our congratulations
to you.

576
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:48,862
And you're bringing me
a present.

577
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,398
Yep. Paternity test
paid for by the state.

578
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:54,501
Why?

579
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:55,944
I think
you can guess.

580
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:58,881
So you can prove
I had sex with Kyle
before he was 17.

581
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,008
Do I have a choice?

582
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:01,677
You can wait
until the baby is born.

583
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:02,742
We can get a court order,

584
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:04,652
but that means you have
six more months of visits

585
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:07,317
to Iook forward to
from Detective Benson
and myself

586
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:08,882
just to make sure
you don't get Iost.

587
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,485
Contact my attorney.
He'II set up the test.

588
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:19,194
Congratulations.
It's a boy.

589
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:20,898
Not what we
wanted to know.

590
00:28:20,972 --> 00:28:22,667
Makes the paternity testing
a Iot easier.

591
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:24,834
Only have to compare
the Y-chromosomes.

592
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,673
Got Lawrence Fuller's
DNA from the morgue.

593
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:28,542
He and Kyle
have the same Y.

594
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:29,807
Then so should
the baby.

595
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:31,849
No. Chromosomes
don't match.

596
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,111
Benson.

597
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:36,185
Somebody else
is the father.

598
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:37,346
Thanks.

599
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:41,715
You're not gonna
believe this.

600
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:45,559
GIoria Stanfield
is in the hospital.
She's been raped.

601
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,165
DOCTOR: Came in by ambulance
about an hour ago.

602
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:52,533
Contusions to her thighs
and upper arms.

603
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:54,265
Rape kit
was positive
for fluids.

604
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,863
She Iose
consciousness?

605
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:58,375
Awake for the whole thing.
He hit her hard.

606
00:28:58,443 --> 00:29:00,274
Bruising's pretty severe.

607
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:02,506
No sign of trauma
to the baby.

608
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:04,606
We're keeping her overnight
for observation.

609
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:05,877
Thanks.

610
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:19,419
Who did this to you,
GIoria?

611
00:29:19,498 --> 00:29:21,125
I don't know.

612
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:27,299
You gonna tell us
some stranger just crawled in
through your window?

613
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:30,936
Forget it, GIoria.

614
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:35,503
You know who did it
because you were
sleeping with him.

615
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,208
Every word
out of your mouth
has been a Iie.

616
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:40,183
Now, you want our help,
you give us his name

617
00:29:40,252 --> 00:29:42,311
and you give it to us now.

618
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:52,457
Frank Barbarossa. I did...
I had a stupid fling with him.

619
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:53,589
I ended it months ago.

620
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:54,927
I thought he was over it,

621
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,902
and all this time
he was just thinking up
ways to hurt me.

622
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,131
He the father of your baby?

623
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:03,496
Mmm-hmm.

624
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:11,847
When he found out
that I married Kyle,
he went crazy.

625
00:30:13,285 --> 00:30:17,915
I really did think that Kyle
killed his father. I was just
trying to protect him.

626
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:20,617
But now you think differently.
You think this

627
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,058
Frank murdered
your husband.

628
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:25,391
Yes.

629
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:29,089
He said it was my fault.

630
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:31,499
That if I keep
playing games with people,

631
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,698
sooner or Iater
that I was going to
have to pay.

632
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:36,934
And that
if I couldn't understand that,

633
00:30:37,008 --> 00:30:40,910
that he would
do the same thing to me
that he did to Lawrence.

634
00:30:53,594 --> 00:30:54,754
Frank Barbarossa?

635
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:55,920
Who are you?

636
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:58,191
Police, Frankie.
You're under arrest.

637
00:30:58,265 --> 00:30:59,289
What are you
arresting me for?

638
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:00,594
Raping GIoria Stanfield.

639
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:03,101
Rape? Wait a minute.
She was raped?

640
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,194
And beaten, tough guy.

641
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:06,171
That why you pump iron?
So you can mess up women?

642
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,401
No, no,
you guys are making a mistake,
you're making a mistake.

643
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:10,568
I didn't... I didn't rape her.
I didn't rape her.

644
00:31:10,644 --> 00:31:14,637
Then I'm glad we got
your DNA so we can clear
your good name.

645
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,180
FIN: No record.
The guy's a personal trainer.

646
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:21,119
Three of his clients Iive in
GIoria Stanfield's building.

647
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:22,348
She one of them?
No.

648
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,855
But he was there
the night of the murder.

649
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,552
Doorman didn't mention it
because Barbarossa's
in the building all the time.

650
00:31:26,627 --> 00:31:28,891
He checked in at 7:30,
out by 9:10.

651
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,457
To see who?

652
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,794
According to this,
one of his clients,
Greta Zabor.

653
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:34,993
But she says
the training session
ended in an hour.

654
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:37,969
Which Ieaves half an hour
unaccounted for.

655
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:44,332
What happened to GIoria?

656
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:46,572
Ah, one of those guys
who Iikes to relive it.

657
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,080
Yeah. AII right.

658
00:31:48,148 --> 00:31:50,446
Legs, arms.

659
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,541
Didn't touch
the face, though,

660
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,418
because what fun is it
to rape a movie star if you
can't recognize her, right?

661
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:59,788
Oh, my God.
What's the matter, Frankie?

662
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,886
You can't stand
the sight of
your own work?

663
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,328
No, I didn't do this.

664
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,366
I Iove her, okay?
I would never Iay
a hand on her.

665
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:07,559
Where were you
Iast night?

666
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,862
FRANK: I was home.

667
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:10,028
Anyone confirm that?

668
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:11,866
No, no. I Iive alone.

669
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:14,806
Look, why do you guys think
this was me?

670
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,570
Because she fingered you.
FRANK: What?

671
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,667
MUNCH: She said that
you raped her

672
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:19,371
then threatened to kill her
Iike you killed her husband.

673
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:20,470
No, that's a Iie.

674
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:22,447
Read her statement, Frank.
We got you.

675
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:24,575
FIN: And we got your DNA
to match to the rape kit.

676
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:29,384
That alone will get you
12-and-a-half to 25 years of
personal training at Attica.

677
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:32,892
No, man. It ain't gonna match,
because I didn't rape her.

678
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,259
Of course
there's a murder conviction.
That's another 25-to-Iife.

679
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,231
Your parole officer
hasn't even been born yet.

680
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,233
Look, I'm telling you guys,
I didn't kill anybody.

681
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:42,598
Think about this,
Frankie.

682
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,433
The jury sees you,
the schmuck trainer
to the rich and famous.

683
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,939
You're jealous,
you want what they have.

684
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,772
So you knock up the actress,
kill the husband
and set up the son.

685
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,709
We got officers going through
your place right now.

686
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:53,871
You think they're gonna
find anything?

687
00:32:53,947 --> 00:32:55,244
Did you throw away
those shoes
you were wearing

688
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:56,680
when you killed
that guy?

689
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,617
I hope so, because
blood is really
hard to rub off.

690
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,517
FIN: Damn near impossible.

691
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,650
That Iying bitch.

692
00:33:05,726 --> 00:33:07,125
Tell me about it.

693
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,498
That bitch!
I'm gonna kill her!
Sit down!

694
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:17,299
No. No, you get me a Iawyer.
You get me a Iawyer.
I don't say anything.

695
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,098
Legal Aid's backed up.

696
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:23,074
Frankie won't have
representation
until tonight.

697
00:33:23,143 --> 00:33:26,340
It doesn't matter. Once the
DNA comes back, no Iawyer's
gonna get him out of this.

698
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:29,644
Got the LUDs
on Barbarossa's cell.
Something interesting.

699
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,379
He got a call the night
of Fuller's murder at 8:40.

700
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:36,513
There's a missing half hour.
He's still someplace
inside that building.

701
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,217
Where was the call from?

702
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,521
BENSON: Pay phone
in the deli across the street.

703
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:43,085
Odds are it's one
of two people,
GIoria or Kyle.

704
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:44,653
They were both out of
the apartment by then.

705
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,894
I doubt Kyle's gonna call
his wife's boyfriend.
It was her.

706
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:51,631
She calls Barbarossa
minutes before
he kills her husband.

707
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:52,763
Why?

708
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:55,105
Find out.

709
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:00,173
FIN: You know this woman?

710
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,078
Yeah, yeah. Seen her
in the neighborhood.

711
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:03,548
Real diva, that one.

712
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:05,482
She ever been in here?

713
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:06,985
A few nights ago.

714
00:34:07,054 --> 00:34:09,818
I asked her for
an autograph, she acted
Iike I was stalking her.

715
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,654
Screw her.
She's not that good
of an actress anyway.

716
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:15,092
What'd she come
in here for?

717
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:17,756
Made a phone call
on the payphone,

718
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:19,924
then she watched out
the window
for a few minutes,

719
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,524
made one more call,
then Ieft.

720
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,863
What was going on
out the window?

721
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,426
I think she was waiting
for somebody

722
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:26,199
to come out of the building
across the street.

723
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,138
You happen to eavesdrop
on those phone conversations?

724
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,005
No, man.
And I tried.

725
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,440
Thanks.

726
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:34,506
We got your message.

727
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:36,742
There's something wrong
with our DNA sample?

728
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:38,182
What did you do
to my sperm?

729
00:34:38,251 --> 00:34:39,650
BENSON: Not a thing.

730
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,383
Somebody did, because
there's no way it came off
a rape victim. Look at this.

731
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:48,056
See how the tail
of each sperm is
bent at the tip?

732
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,595
Yeah. What does
that tell you?

733
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,187
This sperm was frozen.

734
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,993
So, unless your guy
was shooting
through ice cubes,

735
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:55,159
there's no way this semen
could have come from a rape.

736
00:34:55,235 --> 00:34:56,327
Do we know
whose sperm it is?

737
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:57,495
Oh, it's your guy.

738
00:34:57,571 --> 00:35:00,404
Frozen or not, the DNA
from the rape kit matched
the DNA from his towel

739
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:02,965
which matched
the paternity test.

740
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:04,806
There's another thing.

741
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:08,109
The presence of spermicide
from the rape kit sample.

742
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:09,808
Like from a condom.

743
00:35:09,883 --> 00:35:13,614
That GIoria saved
after she had sex
with Frank Barbarossa.

744
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:17,646
She freezes it,
she plants it on herself
to set him up for rape.

745
00:35:18,425 --> 00:35:19,824
And murder.

746
00:35:21,128 --> 00:35:22,288
You drop the rape charges,

747
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:25,559
he'II plead to murder two,
minimum sentencing
recommendation.

748
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:26,792
Why should we do that?

749
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:29,836
Because he's gonna give you
GIoria Stanfield.

750
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:34,837
He agrees to testify
against her, assuming
we can corroborate his story,

751
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:36,842
and you've got a deal.

752
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:40,576
Go ahead.

753
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:43,043
The bitch set me up.

754
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:45,414
Frankie, just tell her
what you know, okay?

755
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:50,620
I'd have done
anything for her.

756
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:53,627
I didn't care about
the money and all that.

757
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,094
I killed the husband,
but I did it because
GIoria told me to.

758
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:01,432
CABOT: How did she
set up the murder?

759
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:06,174
She called me that night,
and she said he was crazy,

760
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:09,938
and that if I didn't do it
right then, that he was
going to kill her.

761
00:36:10,012 --> 00:36:11,309
Did she pay you?

762
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,575
That's not why I did it.

763
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:15,879
She said she was afraid
for her Iife.

764
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:18,784
He used to knock her
and those kids around
all the time.

765
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:21,516
If he was out of the way,
that we could be together,

766
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,716
but he'd never Iet her go.

767
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:27,251
Telling you about her
abusive husband doesn't mean
she asked you to kill him.

768
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:29,160
Well, how the hell you think
I got in the apartment?

769
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,459
She gave me
the security code.

770
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:31,863
That doesn't
prove anything.

771
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:32,958
Why the hell not?

772
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:34,297
Because you were
screwing her,

773
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:35,961
so she could have
given it to you
at any time.

774
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:37,699
Yeah, but she made up
a rape to frame me.

775
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:40,765
That proves that
she's a Iiar,
not a murderer.

776
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:41,866
The kid's baseball bat.

777
00:36:41,944 --> 00:36:45,038
She told me where it was
and she told me what to do
with it when I was done.

778
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:47,172
It was her idea
to set him up, too.

779
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,774
Mr. Barbarossa,
with your statement
you are the only person

780
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:51,409
going to jail for this murder.

781
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:53,716
I need something
I can prove.

782
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:07,232
Well, I guess she's gonna
get away with it.

783
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:12,339
We arresting her?

784
00:37:12,407 --> 00:37:15,535
Nothing he said definitively
points to GIoria.

785
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,670
This might.
Dumped the payphone
from the deli.

786
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:20,476
That other call
that GIoria made
went to Kyle Fuller's cell.

787
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:22,278
Wonder what that
conversation entailed.

788
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:25,081
"Honey, get out of the house.
Your father's about
to get murdered."

789
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:27,587
Would explain
why he's sitting in Rikers.

790
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:29,419
He thinks she did it,
he's protecting her.

791
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:30,924
You get Kyle
to testify to that,

792
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:34,156
we've got corroboration
and an indictment
against GIoria.

793
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:35,753
When's Kyle
getting released?

794
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:38,459
I'm bringing Barbarossa's
confession before a judge
tomorrow morning

795
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:40,467
to formally drop the charges.

796
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:42,059
Kyle's a free man by noon.

797
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,468
And a dead man.

798
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:44,698
He cashes in that trust,

799
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:48,038
GIoria's got no reason
to keep him around anymore.

800
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:52,304
My client's being released
within the hour, Detective,

801
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:54,849
so I'm not quite sure
what we're doing here.

802
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,543
You know why
they're dropping
the charges?

803
00:37:56,618 --> 00:37:57,676
Because I didn't
kill my father.

804
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:58,913
They tell you
who did?

805
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:01,547
Some guy that worked
in my apartment building.

806
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:03,250
No, not some guy.

807
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:06,253
Your stepmother's
boyfriend.

808
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:10,555
You think you can just
make up these Iies
and I'm gonna believe you?

809
00:38:10,632 --> 00:38:12,293
You've been
sitting in prison
for one reason,

810
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,029
your stepmother
set you up for murder.

811
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:17,070
That's not true.

812
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:19,300
Kyle, think about it.

813
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:24,236
The weapon was
your baseball bat,
hidden under your bed.

814
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:26,304
And whose idea
was that?

815
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,179
It was your
stepmother's.

816
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,877
GIoria is my wife.

817
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:32,317
Who's having
another guy's baby.

818
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:43,995
STABLER: Results of
her paternity test.
See for yourself.

819
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,304
Kyle, there's no reason
to protect her anymore.

820
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,344
She doesn't deserve it.

821
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:03,875
It's not true.

822
00:39:07,255 --> 00:39:09,086
Can't argue with DNA.

823
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:20,234
BENSON: She had
her boyfriend
kill your father.

824
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:27,064
And he did it because GIoria
told him that they would
Iive happily ever after.

825
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:30,577
She said the same thing
to you, didn't she?

826
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:36,780
But you couldn't kill him,
and so she got someone else
to do it.

827
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:41,481
But she wanted
to get married to me.

828
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:42,682
It was her idea.

829
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:45,056
So you wouldn't testify
against her.

830
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:49,887
But I would have
protected her.
She didn't have to Iie.

831
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,600
She called you that night
before you Ieft the apartment.

832
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:55,568
What'd she say to you?

833
00:39:57,773 --> 00:39:59,604
She told me to Ieave.

834
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:06,246
That she was gonna take care
of everything, and that after
that night we'd be together.

835
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,912
She told me she Ioved me.

836
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,464
Hey, can I have
your autograph?

837
00:40:27,602 --> 00:40:28,830
What, are you
following me?

838
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:30,235
We heard you made
an appointment.

839
00:40:31,373 --> 00:40:34,831
Family planning services.
You're getting rid
of the baby, too.

840
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,810
Guess nobody's safe
around you.

841
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:52,185
Hey.

842
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:54,961
What are you doing?

843
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,295
Sweetheart, I told you
why I can't have the baby.

844
00:40:58,366 --> 00:41:00,857
We agreed that this was
the best thing for us.

845
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:02,096
Right.

846
00:41:02,537 --> 00:41:04,300
KYLE: But you said
it was mine.

847
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:07,569
Which proves
we were having sex
before I was 17.

848
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,611
Kyle, this is for us.

849
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,113
No, it's not.

850
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:16,876
Look, I know
the baby isn't mine.

851
00:41:17,385 --> 00:41:21,412
So if you wanna kill it,
go ahead.
I don't care anymore.

852
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,650
Kyle, please.

853
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:24,157
Just tell me something.

854
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:29,186
This whole time
we were together,
this whole year,

855
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:33,799
was it all
part of your plan?

856
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:36,360
Make me Iove you
so I would do
whatever you wanted?

857
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:37,700
Absolutely not.

858
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:41,469
Because if it was,
you didn't have to do that.

859
00:41:42,978 --> 00:41:44,912
You didn't have to pretend.

860
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:48,108
I already Ioved you, GIoria.

861
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:52,251
I can't remember
when I didn't.

862
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:54,418
I do Iove you, Kyle.

863
00:41:55,624 --> 00:41:56,648
We're married.

864
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:59,922
That's why I don't wanna have
another man's baby.

865
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:04,659
Look, I only Iied to you

866
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:08,567
because I thought you were
too young to understand.
It was my mistake.

867
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:11,071
I will not Iet that
happen again.

868
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,273
I had my Iawyer do this.

869
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,011
It's for you.
BENSON: Petition
for divorce, GIoria.

870
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:25,313
You're gonna be
a free woman.

871
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:28,754
Not for Iong, though.
You're under arrest
for murder.

872
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:31,214
You don't know
what you're doing, Kyle.

873
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:32,351
No.

874
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:36,295
I know exactly
what I'm doing,

875
00:42:37,566 --> 00:42:38,692
Mom.
