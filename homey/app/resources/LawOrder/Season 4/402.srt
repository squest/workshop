1
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:06,170
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:09,870
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:11,139
In New York City,

4
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:14,011
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:17,609
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,711
These are their stories.

7
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:23,818
So what kinds of things
do you Iike to draw, Chloe?

8
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:24,984
Cats.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,550
Cats?
I Iike cats.

10
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:32,462
You know, your teacher
showed me a really
great picture that you drew.

11
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:36,627
Is that your family?
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,341
Are you
in this picture?

13
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:43,270
That's me
and that's Mommy
and Kyle.

14
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,005
You Iook sad
in this picture.
Are those tears?

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,347
Why are you crying?

16
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,884
Kyle is your brother?

17
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,891
He's my half-brother.

18
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:00,052
Oh, 'cause
you guys have
different moms, right?

19
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:02,187
We have the same daddy.
Daddy?

20
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:04,698
There's no daddy
in this picture.
Where's he?

21
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:05,960
He's out of town.

22
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:07,501
Is that
why you're sad?

23
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,695
No.

24
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,397
Okay. Chloe,

25
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:14,708
are you sad
'cause someone's
hurting you?

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,870
I don't know.

27
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:22,948
Usually Chloe's
very happy, outgoing,

28
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:24,883
but Iately
she's been withdrawn.

29
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:26,716
And I've noticed
some bruises
on her Iegs.

30
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:28,949
Okay, once
Detective Benson's
finished talking with her

31
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,219
we'II need to take her
to the hospital
for an exam.

32
00:01:31,293 --> 00:01:33,727
The father's
a Iittle high-strung.
What do I tell him?

33
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:36,286
We'II send an officer
here to meet him,
bring him to the hospital.

34
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:37,422
What do you mean,
high-strung?

35
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:41,265
A yeller. You know,
corporate mogul type,
Lawrence Fuller.

36
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,330
Fuller Telecom?
Yeah.

37
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:44,463
Guy's name
is on my cable bill.

38
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,737
Well, you should probably
also know that Chloe's
mother is GIoria Stanfield.

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,143
The actress.
She did a few movies
about 10 years ago.

40
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:53,476
So you're asking
for discretion.

41
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:56,278
No, I'm just giving you
fair warning.
They're both a handful.

42
00:01:56,852 --> 00:02:01,118
Chloe, your mom
and Kyle Iook
really happy here, huh?

43
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,392
How come you're
the only one
that's sad?

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,156
Because Mommy
Ioves Kyle
more than me.

45
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:11,695
I bet she Ioves you
both the same.

46
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:15,793
She reads him stories
all the time,
but not to me.

47
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,406
Where does she
read Kyle stories?

48
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:20,941
In his room.

49
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,402
They close the door
and I'm not allowed.

50
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:30,412
You never
went in there?
Not one time?

51
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:33,650
It was because
I heard noises.

52
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:36,583
I thought
Mommy was crying.

53
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,390
What were they doing?

54
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:43,825
They were
playing in bed.

55
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:49,895
They didn't have
any clothes on.

56
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:45,117
The colposcopic exam
didn't reveal any signs
of sexual abuse.

57
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:47,286
Anything that indicates
straight physical abuse?

58
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:48,761
Some bruises
on her shins.

59
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,991
Pretty typical
for a five-year-old.

60
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,261
Scan showed healed wrist
and tibia fractures,

61
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:56,065
but she doesn't remember
how she got them.

62
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:57,126
You talk
to the parents yet?

63
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:59,469
Actually, we're gonna wait
till we speak with Chloe.

64
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:03,944
Yeah, well, I think that's
her father, and he Iooks
Iike he wants to go.

65
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,213
Are you the detectives
who brought my daughter here?

66
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:10,012
Is she all right?
She's fine, Mr. Fuller.

67
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:12,315
Why don't we go someplace
where we can discuss it
more privately?

68
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,252
School tells me
I have to go
to the hospital.

69
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,586
No one tells me why.
Is Chloe hurt?

70
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:19,149
No. No, but there was
some concern
at her school.

71
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,626
Concern about what?

72
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:24,187
She said some things
that might indicate
problems at home.

73
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,358
What kind of problems?

74
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,527
Actually, we were hoping
that you could help us
with that.

75
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,333
When did Chloe
break her wrist
and her Ieg?

76
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:35,536
When she was three.
She fell off a slide
in a playground.

77
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,738
Is that what this is about?
It was an accident.

78
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,838
You dragged her
to a hospital for that?

79
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:44,407
We brought her here
based on a picture
she drew at school

80
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:47,387
and statements
she made to
Detective Benson

81
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,319
which seemed to

82
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:55,294
describe a sexual
relationship between
your wife and your son.

83
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,295
What are you
talking about?
What kind of picture?

84
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:02,962
Your daughter said
she'd seen them sleeping
in the same bed together.

85
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,836
Are you out of your mind?
She's his mother.

86
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:08,398
BENSON: Do you think that
Chloe made it up?

87
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:10,871
She had to. I...

88
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:13,470
Where's your wife
now, Mr. Fuller?

89
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,573
Our house in the Hamptons,
antique shopping.

90
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,381
Have you ever seen
any behavior that
confirms Chloe's story?

91
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,382
I don't think so.

92
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:24,157
But you damn well better believe
I'II be finding out.

93
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:27,319
Sir, it's really
best if you allow us
to investigate.

94
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:30,694
You investigate all you Iike.
I'm taking Chloe home.

95
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:37,171
Kyle Fuller's school
records describe a normal,
well-adjusted kid,

96
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:39,832
till the second grade
when his mother was
killed in a car accident.

97
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,603
Not surprising
he had a tough time.

98
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,166
In the fifth grade
his behavior got worse.

99
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:46,475
Loss of appetite,
sudden outbursts,
fighting.

100
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:48,743
That was the same year
his father married
GIoria Stanfield.

101
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,648
Well, it could be
adjusting to a stepmother.

102
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,586
Or the stepmother
pulled a Woody AIIen
way back then.

103
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:56,624
Proving that's the only way
we're gonna charge her
with statutory rape.

104
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,818
It's not illegal to have
sex with a 17-year-old.

105
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,417
He turned 17 Iast month.

106
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:03,020
You don't think
it's Iikely that the abuse
started Iong before that?

107
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:05,532
Doesn't matter what
I think if they're not
breaking the Iaw.

108
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,037
Even if the abuse started
yesterday, she's still
essentially his mother.

109
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:12,369
She's taking advantage
of her control over him.

110
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,069
Unless he's a normal teenager
who's just happy to be
banging an actress.

111
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:17,509
Look, if nothing else,

112
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,809
that environment
is unhealthy
for that Iittle girl.

113
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,679
Well, this all depends
on whether we believe
what she's saying is true.

114
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:23,775
BENSON: And I do.

115
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:27,151
Kids her age
don't usually make up
things Iike this.

116
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:31,585
When is the mother
due back in town?

117
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,354
Anytime, if she gets word
we're Iooking at her.

118
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:35,362
She's gonna want to circle
the family wagons.

119
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,422
Well, I'd Iike to know
if we have a complaining
witness before that happens.

120
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,832
Fin, you and John
go talk to Kyle.

121
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:43,837
If he is a victim, he may
want to know there's something
he can do to stop it.

122
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:47,204
You know, a family
Iike this probably has
plenty of hired help.

123
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:49,470
Something's going on
in that house,
they'd know about it.

124
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,034
AII right, discretion,
everybody.

125
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,774
The Ionger we keep this
out of the papers,
the better.

126
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,084
Kyle Fuller.
Can we talk to you
alone for a minute?

127
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:03,547
I'II see you guys Iater.
Yeah.

128
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:06,753
What's this about?

129
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:08,728
You talk to
your father today?

130
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:11,766
No, I won't see him
till tonight. Why,
did something happen?

131
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,802
He's fine.
How things going
for you at home?

132
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,136
Okay. Why?

133
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,431
Get along with
your mother?

134
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,168
My stepmother?

135
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,938
She's all right.
Why are you asking
about her?

136
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:26,606
One of our detectives
talked to your sister Chloe.

137
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,410
We're with the
Special Victims Unit.

138
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:31,646
One of the things
we investigate
is child abuse.

139
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:34,146
You think Chloe's
being abused?

140
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:36,019
FIN: No, not Chloe. You.

141
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,351
She told you that?

142
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:42,021
She said you and your
stepmother sleep
in the same bed. Is that true?

143
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,793
Okay, wait.

144
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,995
Wait. If you think
that we're sleeping together,

145
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:53,098
Iike, having sex,
that's just sick.

146
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:56,541
I mean, GIoria's been
my stepmom since I was,
Iike, 10.

147
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,478
And you don't wanna
get her into trouble.
We understand that.

148
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:03,574
No. It's just that
there's no way that
we're sleeping together

149
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,243
or having sex
or anything.

150
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,689
I mean, if that's
what Chloe told you,
Iook, I'm sorry, I really am.

151
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,225
I'm sorry you came down here
and wasted your time,

152
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,454
but it's just not true.

153
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,124
Okay?

154
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:24,795
Detectives,
I've told you three times,

155
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:28,468
my employment contract
includes a
confidentiality clause.

156
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,704
Meaning
you know something,
you just can't say.

157
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,075
That's not what I mean.

158
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:33,909
Do you get along with
Ms. Stanfield?

159
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:36,815
She's an excellent employer,
and that's all I will say.

160
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,580
Well, what do they
pay you for
a gig Iike this?

161
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:40,348
That's none
of your concern.

162
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:43,413
I'II bet there are
a Iot of under-the-table
cash transactions.

163
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,685
Is that true?

164
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,057
Well, we could find out.
Drop a dime to the IRS,

165
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:50,564
have them go through
your undeclared cash income
with a fine-toothed comb.

166
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:52,532
That would jam her up for,
what, about three years?

167
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,794
Minimum.

168
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:58,231
We find truth in
what Chloe is saying,
your boss is going down.

169
00:08:58,306 --> 00:09:01,742
You'd better
decide right now.
You want to join her?

170
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:06,806
I saw them together once,
a few weeks ago.

171
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,246
Doing what?

172
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,351
I walked into the room.

173
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,114
She was kissing Kyle.

174
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,381
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

175
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:17,322
It wasn't the way
a mother kisses her son.

176
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:20,122
Benson.
It was only a moment.

177
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:21,491
I hardly saw anything.

178
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:23,053
It sounds Iike
you saw plenty.

179
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,359
BENSON: Thanks.

180
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:28,027
GIoria Stanfield's
back in town.
At her Iawyer's office.

181
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:30,502
Our presence
is kindly requested.

182
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,704
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Detectives.

183
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,646
You must know my client,
GIoria Stanfield.

184
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,839
Heard a Iot about you.

185
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,044
GLORIA: I'II be with you
in a minute.

186
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:49,351
She wanted to clear
this matter up as soon
as she got back to town.

187
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:50,448
STABLER: How were
the Hamptons?

188
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:51,617
Dull.

189
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,521
I know the other detectives
already spoke to Kyle.

190
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:56,689
He told you the truth.

191
00:09:56,764 --> 00:10:00,222
I am not having
a sexual relationship
with my stepson.

192
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:04,166
What more
can I tell you?

193
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,206
You think Chloe
Iied about it?

194
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:10,040
I think she
makes up stories.
She's a child.

195
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,341
Well, then,
why do we have
other adult witnesses

196
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:16,474
who describe
a pretty passionate kiss
between you and your stepson?

197
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,644
I kiss everyone,
Detective.

198
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,650
The simple fact
is you're investigating

199
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:24,920
the misconception of
an imaginative five-year-old.

200
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,596
Where do you think
Chloe got these ideas from?

201
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:32,030
Television, probably.
My old movies,
for that matter.

202
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,995
You know, this is
really ridiculous.

203
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,698
Chloe draws a picture,
and everyone blows it
out of proportion.

204
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:42,038
I would never do anything
to hurt my stepson.

205
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:46,875
No complaining witness,
no physical evidence of abuse,

206
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:51,112
no independent verification
other than an
uncooperative housekeeper

207
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,915
who saw a stepmother
kiss her stepson.

208
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,718
And no indictment
based on a
kindergartner's art project.

209
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,986
There's something
going on in that house.

210
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,118
That woman's wrong.

211
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,889
We're gonna need more
than your gut.

212
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:04,454
I can contact my counterpart
at Children's Services.

213
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,500
At the very Ieast,
they can start
a file on GIoria.

214
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,967
I just got a call
from a patrol
out of the 22

215
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:11,801
responding to
a domestic disturbance
at the Formby Day School.

216
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:12,999
What happened?

217
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:16,976
GIoria and her husband
are fighting over
who's taking the daughter.

218
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:18,672
You Iet me take
my daughter home
right now

219
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,976
or I will slap a Iawsuit
on you so fast...
Don't Iet him near her.

220
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,778
You see
how angry he gets.

221
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,909
Shut up.
She raped my son.

222
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:27,113
God knows what she did
to my daughter.
Our daughter.

223
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,679
Look, you don't deserve
to be a mother.
You're disgusting.

224
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:30,951
Yeah, make up
some more stories.

225
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,051
Everyone knows it's so you can
get out of child support
when I divorce you!

226
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:37,291
I'm gonna kill you
if you touch my children!
Mr. Fuller!

227
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:40,596
I don't want to hear
another threat Iike that.
Now, am I clear?

228
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:43,102
Yeah.
You say I'm the abuser.

229
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:47,369
He hits me and he hits them.
You should investigate that!

230
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,467
You two
can fight this out
in Family Court.

231
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,876
Until then,
your children will be
in the custody of the state.

232
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,379
What?
You can't do that!

233
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:56,281
If we think your children
are in imminent danger,
we certainly can.

234
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,979
If they keep at it,
bring them in
for disorderly conduct.

235
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:02,215
FULLER: Oh, no, no, no.
Chloe, sweetheart.

236
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,279
Wait a minute.

237
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:04,648
Baby.

238
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:05,784
FULLER: No.
It's okay.

239
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,259
This is kidnapping!

240
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:10,764
Munch, I need you to do
an emergency removal
of Kyle Fuller.

241
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:12,197
Pick him up at his school.

242
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,200
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

243
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:19,105
You guys are friends
of Kyle Fuller, right?

244
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,663
You seen him?

245
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,835
He Ieft already.
What are you guys
investigating?

246
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,675
Kyle get along okay
with his family?
His stepmom?

247
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:28,181
Yeah, he and GIoria
got along really well.

248
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,477
How do you know?

249
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,575
Well, everybody knows
about GIoria.

250
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,916
She's very open.

251
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,118
What, is she putting out
for all his school buddies?

252
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,023
Not that. She just Iikes
having guys around.

253
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,560
She doesn't mind,
you know,
if you Iook at her.

254
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:43,324
Yeah, it's Iike she's
wearing clothes, but you can
totally see through them.

255
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,524
And she's always giving
everybody backrubs.

256
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,726
And what does
Kyle think of all this?

257
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:47,961
He digs it.

258
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,764
It's not his real mom,
so who cares?

259
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,771
It sounds Iike you think
there's more going on

260
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,774
than just backrubs
and peep shows.

261
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:58,778
I don't know
if he's banging her,
but I wouldn't be surprised.

262
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,241
Where's the Iittle one?

263
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,718
ACS placed her
with an aunt
and uncle in the area.

264
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:09,518
Well, Iet's all hope
insanity isn't
a family trait.

265
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,818
Any Iuck with Kyle?

266
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:12,291
No. Not at home,
not with friends.

267
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,456
Munch and Fin are still
out Iooking, and your day
isn't over yet.

268
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,639
Doorman called it in.
No witnesses.
Nobody heard a struggle.

269
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,233
Where's the rest
of the Addams family?

270
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,938
MIA.
Forced entry?

271
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:34,277
Door was ajar,
Iocks intact.

272
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:37,943
Whoever did this
knew the security code.
There's no apparent robbery.

273
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,283
Bashed in
his skull, Ieft.

274
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,096
BIow to the back of the head's
probably what did it,

275
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,727
but he's got impact
wounds to the torso,
thighs, forearms.

276
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:56,963
Went down fighting.

277
00:13:57,038 --> 00:14:00,405
Murder weapon Iooks Iike
it's cylindrical, two
or three inches in diameter.

278
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:01,736
MUNCH: Like a baseball bat?

279
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,174
That'd do it.

280
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:06,436
I found it
under Kyle's bed.
I'II bag it for prints.

281
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:10,314
Fin's talking to
the doorman to see
if Kyle Ieft in a hurry.

282
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,375
Mr. Fuller came in
around 8:00.

283
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,149
After about 20 minutes,
Ms. Stanfield Ieft,

284
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:17,691
then Kyle about
15 minutes Iater.

285
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:20,522
Did you notice
anything unusual
about either of them?

286
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:23,462
Ms. Stanfield
was in a hurry,
but that's typical.

287
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,967
Kyle. I guess
he seemed a Iittle upset.

288
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:29,292
Where are
the other entrances?

289
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,394
Back and side doors,

290
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,996
but they're all Iocked
and hooked up
to the alarm system.

291
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:35,702
And no one enters
without signing in.

292
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:39,007
Pretty quiet today.
Nobody out of the ordinary.

293
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,775
Just guests of the tenants.

294
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,578
Okay. I'm gonna
get this back to you, okay?

295
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,218
What's going on?

296
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,916
Your father was killed.

297
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:54,425
Somebody attacked him
in your apartment.
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:57,926
Where's GIoria?

299
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,968
Well, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

300
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:03,663
You're taking
your father's death
kind of well, though.

301
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,103
Come on.

302
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,605
It's my day off.

303
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:09,199
I stopped by
to check on
Ms. Stanfield

304
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:11,438
and the front door was open.

305
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:14,481
I came in,
found Mr. Fuller.

306
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,743
Why were you
checking on
Ms. Stanfield?

307
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,012
She called
after you took Chloe.

308
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,749
She was so upset.
I wanted to make sure
she was all right.

309
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:24,489
You know where
she was calling from?

310
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,321
I assumed here.

311
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:29,227
There was no one else
in the apartment.

312
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:32,960
She couldn't have done this,
Detective. It's not possible.

313
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,226
MUNCH: How'd you get
that shiner?

314
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:37,703
At school, in Phys Ed.

315
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:39,296
It Iooks Iike
you got punched.

316
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:40,465
Thought it might be
your dad.

317
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,565
MUNCH: Is that what happened?

318
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,371
He started to hit you
and you defended yourself?

319
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:44,502
No.

320
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:46,874
I didn't kill him.

321
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:48,313
Any idea who did?

322
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,651
Where'd you go tonight?

323
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,577
For a walk.

324
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,680
MUNCH: Why?

325
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:57,122
Because I felt Iike it.

326
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:59,422
Your dad and stepmom
were home
before you Ieft.

327
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:03,055
That's gotta be a pretty
contentious relationship
these days, huh?

328
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:04,792
I don't know anything
about it.

329
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:08,063
Okay, you went out
for a walk.
Where'd GIoria go?

330
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:09,932
She didn't kill him.

331
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:13,099
FIN: Well, how do you know?
You went out for a walk.

332
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:16,266
I just know.

333
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:18,575
How many school uniforms
do you have?

334
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,642
About six.
Where's the one
you wore today?

335
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:24,049
I changed when I got home.

336
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,577
BIood stains kind of clash
with the school colors, huh?

337
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,852
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

338
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:32,257
Detectives.

339
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:42,269
Hold off
on the questions
for a minute.

340
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,328
Why?
Kid Iawyered up.

341
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:50,868
Mr. Schaefer,
if you'II follow me
to interrogation.

342
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:54,575
You're not worried about
a conflict of interest there,
Counselor?

343
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:56,549
Ms. Stanfield
is a suspect also.

344
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:59,553
If charges are filed,
Kyle obtains new counsel.

345
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:02,385
Until then,
no conflict.

346
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:03,890
Who's representing you?

347
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,484
I'II answer any questions
you have without
my attorney present.

348
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,290
I'm gonna advise you
against that.

349
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:11,730
No. Really, it's okay.
I haven't got anything
to hide.

350
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,324
Right this way.

351
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:18,236
I have no idea what happened.
I went to a hotel tonight.

352
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:19,466
STABLER: Why?

353
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,168
You saw my husband
at the school.

354
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:24,337
Do you honestly think
I wanted to be anywhere
near that man?

355
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:26,643
BENSON: Well, then
why go home at all?

356
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:29,548
Well, Detective Benson,
to get my things.

357
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:31,444
My stepson was there.

358
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,489
I tried to explain to him
what was happening.

359
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,957
Kyle got so angry,

360
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:39,016
and then Lawrence walked in.

361
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,755
They started fighting.

362
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:43,889
Lawrence got physical,
as usual, pushed him.

363
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,126
I couldn't stand it
anymore so I Ieft.

364
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:49,568
You Ieft your husband
to push around your stepson?

365
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:51,469
How would I stop him?

366
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:55,302
Believe me, I've tried.
It only makes things worse.

367
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:58,278
Will the hotel
confirm your story?

368
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:01,474
The Sienna.
They'II tell you
when I checked in.

369
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,074
Is that all?

370
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,277
One more thing.

371
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:08,347
Was your husband
still breathing
when you Ieft?

372
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,653
I didn't kill him.

373
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:14,420
I have no reason.

374
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,623
Well, actually,
I could think of a couple.

375
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:18,825
Custody of the kids.
Inheriting his money.

376
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,767
Lawrence made me sign
a prenuptial agreement.

377
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:25,432
He always believed
that I was a gold digger
at heart.

378
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:31,446
The money goes to
Kyle and Chloe in trusts that
I am not allowed to touch.

379
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:35,108
So when you Ieft
Kyle and his father
were still fighting?

380
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:37,182
Kyle didn't do this.

381
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:39,982
But you'd already Ieft,
so you don't know
that for sure.

382
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:42,853
Look, I will answer
any questions
that you have about me,

383
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:45,859
but I just Iost my husband
and my daughter.

384
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,293
I'm not gonna help you
frame my stepson.

385
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:52,666
CABOT: Anyone Iook good
for the arrest?

386
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:56,101
Well, one's covering
for the other.
I'm just not sure who.

387
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:58,264
The murder weapon was found
under the boy's bed.

388
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,865
I'm guessing GIoria Stanfield
doesn't have a baseball bat.

389
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:03,001
Well, doesn't mean
she didn't borrow it.

390
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:04,602
Kyle came back
to the crime scene.

391
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,670
If he killed the guy,
why the hell
didn't he stay away?

392
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:10,741
Maybe to pick up
the murder weapon.
Only one set of prints on it.

393
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:13,611
Kyle Fuller's.

394
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:16,155
Arrest him.

395
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:21,255
We have been more than
cooperative, so if you're not
planning on arresting Kyle...

396
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,921
Stand up.
Why?

397
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:24,363
Because we're planning
on arresting you.

398
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:26,127
For what?
The murder
of Lawrence Fuller.

399
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:28,999
Come on, Iet's not
make this any harder.

400
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:31,031
You have the right
to an attorney.

401
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:33,438
You want my advice,
don't take one that's
on your mother's payroll.

402
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:35,806
You're making a mistake.
My son is innocent.

403
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,276
You're the only
other suspect,

404
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,813
so if you got a confession,
now's the time to give it.

405
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,542
I'II have him out
by morning.

406
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:42,605
Kyle, don't say
anything.

407
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,708
I won't.

408
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,980
I'm getting you a Iawyer.
I'II take care of everything.

409
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,215
Don't tell them
anything.

00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:03,329
Not guilty.

I'II hear the People
on bail.

416
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:07,702
The defendant has
unlimited financial means
at his disposal

417
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:10,007
and no business
or familial responsibilities.

418
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,014
We consider him to be
a flight risk and request
remand, Your Honor.

419
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:15,141
He is a 17-year-old boy

00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:17,743
with strong ties
to his stepmother
and his five-year-old sister.

he's not a flight risk,
Your Honor.

424

CABOT: The defendant
is charged with
viciously beating

425

his father to death
with a baseball bat.

426
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,894
This is a first arrest.
He is no hardened criminal.

427
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:33,868
Bail is set at $1,000,000,

428

and we'II also hold onto
Mr. Fuller's passport

of the trial.

Take him
all of five seconds

434
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:49,213
He didn't pull
this off alone.

435
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:53,619
Find me some evidence and
I will charge GIoria Stanfield
as a co-conspirator.

436
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,589
First place
I'd Iike to Iook
is her hotel room.

437
00:20:55,658 --> 00:20:57,489
I can't send you
on a fishing expedition.

438
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,460
The judge is going to
want to know
what you're Iooking for.

439
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:01,359
Kyle's school uniform.

440
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,059
If he was wearing it
when he killed Fuller, it's
gotta have blood all over it.

441
00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:07,728
He had to stash it
somewhere.

442
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,600
I'II get a warrant.

443
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:19,207
GIoria Stanfield's room,
please.

444
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:20,647
I'm sorry,
I can't give
that out.

445
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:22,775
This says
you can.

446
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:27,845
I can give you the room,
but she's not in right now.

447
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:29,720
Well, do you know
where she went?

448
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:33,353
DESK CLERK: I arranged for
a car to JFK. They didn't say
where they were going.

449
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:36,364
They? She had
her son with her?

450
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:38,900
He was young,
but I'm sure
he wasn't her son.

451
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:41,198
Not the way
they were acting.

452
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:44,203
Anything from
the passenger manifests?

453
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:47,674
We're calling on domestic
flights. There are over 70
airlines that fly out of JFK.

454
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:49,267
Well, there's no activity
on her credit card,

455
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:52,246
so if they flew,
they must've paid cash
for the tickets.

456
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:56,217
Departed on FIight 1647
to Dulles, 11:00 this morning.

457
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:57,650
DC? What the hell
they doing there?

458
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,984
Thanks.
They're already back.

459
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:02,490
They Ianded at JFK
two hours ago.

460
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:05,353
The other officers
have already searched
the room.

461
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:06,918
How many times
do you need to see it?

462
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:08,827
Till we find
what we're Iooking for.

463
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:10,593
Don't worry about it.
The warrant's
still valid.

464
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,224
The guests may be inside.

465
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:14,826
You know what?
Let's surprise them.

466
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:21,473
BENSON: NYPD.
Come on out, Kyle.

467
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:22,841
KYLE: Don't come in here!

468
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,843
We got a warrant to search
this room, and we're going
to start with the bed.

469
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:31,648
Hey, you forget that
Iittle detail about
not Ieaving this jurisdiction?

470
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:33,484
You blew it, buddy.

471
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:35,551
We didn't do
anything wrong.

472
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:37,057
BENSON: Yeah, you did.

473
00:22:37,126 --> 00:22:38,787
So get up, get dressed,

474
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,489
and have your Iawyer meet you
down at the station.

475
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:45,728
We don't have to say
anything to you.
We're married now.

476
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:58,738
Where's Kyle?

477
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:02,272
In a cell at the courthouse,
waiting for a judge
to revoke his bail,

478
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:03,648
send his ass to Rikers.

479
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,744
Explain this to me.

480
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:10,554
You're questioning my client
because she was in bed
with her husband?

481
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:13,459
Who, up until yesterday,
was her stepson.

482
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:16,225
You want to tell us again
how you never abused him,
GIoria?

483
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:18,423
SCHAEFER: He's 17 years old.
It's not abuse.

484
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:22,130
You expect us to believe
that she waited until it was
Iegal to sleep with him?

485
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:25,662
Well, unless you have evidence
to the contrary,
you have to believe it.

486
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:27,538
I never abused him.

487
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,268
We're in Iove.

488
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:33,907
You're in Iove with a boy
you've raised since
he was 10 years old?

489
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:36,816
Sweetheart,
that's not Iove,
that's pedophilia.

490
00:23:36,886 --> 00:23:40,049
Nothing happened
until after he was 17.

491
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:41,555
A month ago.

492
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:46,061
You must've given him
one hell of a
birthday present, GIoria.

493
00:23:48,264 --> 00:23:50,391
I'II take
the blame for it.

494
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:52,290
I was Ionely.

495
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:56,327
My husband was never home.
He hadn't touched me
in over a year.

496
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,903
Kyle knew I was hurt.

497
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:04,612
He only wants me to be happy,
and I want the same thing
for him.

498
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,308
What happened between us
may be wrong in your eyes,

499
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:09,442
but we can't help
the way we feel.

500
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:13,010
The detectives will explain
to you that you've done
nothing wrong at all.

501
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:16,285
You're not blood-related.
There's no crime.

502
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:18,920
So the widow Stanfield
marries her stepson

503
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:21,053
right in the middle
of a murder investigation.

504
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,691
Now neither one of them
has to testify against
each other in a court.

505
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,064
It's a huge coincidence.

506
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:30,003
Spousal privilege protects
the sanctity of marriage,
Detectives.

507
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:35,237
Well, it also protects them
from telling the truth about
who killed Lawrence Fuller.

508
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,477
During the course
of their investigation,

509
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:45,714
SVU detectives discovered
the defendant
Ieft his jurisdiction,

510
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,619
violating the conditions
of his bail agreement.

511
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,352
This was obviously
not an attempt to skip bail,
Your Honor,

512
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:53,554
as evidenced by the fact
that my client was on his way
back to New York

513
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:55,494
before the detectives
knew he was gone.

514
00:24:55,564 --> 00:24:58,499
The sole purpose
of this trip was to travel
to the state of Virginia,

515
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:00,797
which allows non-residents
to obtain marriage Iicenses

516
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,600
without waiting periods
or blood tests.

517
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,371
He skipped town
to get married?

518
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:08,808
Virginia also allows
a person
under the age of 18

519
00:25:08,878 --> 00:25:10,846
to marry with the permission
of a Iegal guardian,

520
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:14,440
despite the fact that
the defendant was, in fact,
marrying his Iegal guardian,

521
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:16,314
his stepmother,
GIoria Stanfield,

522
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:18,785
currently under investigation
for child abuse and murder.

523
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:21,379
None of this is relevant
to the matter of bail,
Your Honor.

524
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:24,017
But it is relevant
to the defendant's trial.

525
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:26,618
This marriage is an attempt
to abuse spousal privilege

526
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:30,096
and circumvent the very
investigation which may Iand
the defendant in jail.

527
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:33,623
Whether or not the defendant
intended to avoid prosecution,

528
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:36,034
he violated
his bail agreement.

529
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:38,539
Bail is revoked.
Defendant is remanded.

530
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:41,599
Congratulations
on your nuptials,
young man.

531
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:47,749
CABOT: Get anything
from the blushing bride?

532
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:49,408
She's sticking
to her story.

533
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:52,147
Nothing happened
until after
he turned 17.

534
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:54,985
Cut her Ioose.
We sure the marriage
is valid?

535
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:55,991
According to the
Virginia State Attorney's
office.

536
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:58,994
There is nothing on the books
preventing a minor
from marrying a stepparent.

537
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:00,222
It's perfectly Iegal.

538
00:26:00,997 --> 00:26:02,521
And newsworthy.

539
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:07,762
Did GIoria Stanfield
abuse her children?

540
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:10,305
Is the district attorney
planning to indict her
for her husband's murder?

541
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:11,362
CABOT: We have no comment.

542
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:12,908
Hey, does GIoria Stanfield's
pregnancy

543
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:14,568
have any effect on
the child abuse allegations?

544
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:15,668
Who told you that?

545
00:26:15,745 --> 00:26:17,007
I'm not
at Iiberty to say.

546
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,377
Let me talk to you
a second.
Hey, hey, hey...

547
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:20,575
Right over here.
I won't reveal my sources.

548
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:24,313
You know what?
Don't give me
this intimidation crap.

549
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:26,651
First Amendment, kids.
I'm a journalist.

550
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:29,624
For the National Probe.
That's a real
respectable publication.

551
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:32,093
You guys are just pissed
because I got the goods
before you.

552
00:26:32,162 --> 00:26:33,959
What'd you do?
Stake out her
doctor's office?

553
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,827
Bribe some receptionist
for her medical records?

554
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:38,367
AII I'm saying is,
she's knocked up.
Three months along.

555
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:40,198
And that stepson of hers
is the father.

556
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,396
How do you know that?

557
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:43,769
Because she brought him
with her to the appointment.

558
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,401
Use your brains, honey.
Why else would
she marry the kid?

559
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,614
Heard you're gonna be
a daddy. That true?

560
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:59,416
Don't answer that.
Why the hell not?

561
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:02,390
Whatever his answer is,
it doesn't incriminate him,
just his mother.

562
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:03,756
GIoria is my wife.

563
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:05,920
Look at him.
Know what that is?

564
00:27:05,996 --> 00:27:07,054
Fatherly pride.

565
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,256
FIN: Kid's yours, then?

566
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:12,734
My client has no way
of knowing the paternity
of GIoria Stanfield's child.

567
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:14,667
But it's possible,
right?

568
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:18,196
Ask him something
he can actually answer
or we're done.

569
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:23,035
Did she tell you
that was your baby?
Is that why you got married?

570
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:29,318
Anything GIoria told me was
after we were married.

571
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:32,616
That means
I don't have to
answer your question.

572
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:42,025
Thank you, Detective Benson.
And they say chivalry's dead.

573
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:46,033
You shopping for
your husband's funeral
or maternity clothes?

574
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:47,296
Little bit of both.

575
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,304
We wanted to offer
our congratulations
to you.

576
00:27:49,372 --> 00:27:50,862
And you're bringing me
a present.

577
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,398
Yep. Paternity test
paid for by the state.

578
00:27:55,512 --> 00:27:56,501
Why?

579
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:57,944
I think
you can guess.

580
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,881
So you can prove
I had sex with Kyle
before he was 17.

581
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,008
Do I have a choice?

582
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:03,677
You can wait
until the baby is born.

583
00:28:03,753 --> 00:28:04,742
We can get a court order,

584
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,652
but that means you have
six more months of visits

585
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:09,317
to Iook forward to
from Detective Benson
and myself

586
00:28:09,392 --> 00:28:10,882
just to make sure
you don't get Iost.

587
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,485
Contact my attorney.
He'II set up the test.

588
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:21,194
Congratulations.
It's a boy.

589
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:22,898
Not what we
wanted to know.

590
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:24,667
Makes the paternity testing
a Iot easier.

591
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:26,834
Only have to compare
the Y-chromosomes.

592
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,673
Got Lawrence Fuller's
DNA from the morgue.

593
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:30,542
He and Kyle
have the same Y.

594
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:31,807
Then so should
the baby.

595
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:33,849
No. Chromosomes
don't match.

596
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,111
Benson.

597
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:38,185
Somebody else
is the father.

598
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:39,346
Thanks.

599
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:43,715
You're not gonna
believe this.

600
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:47,559
GIoria Stanfield
is in the hospital.
She's been raped.

601
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:52,165
DOCTOR: Came in by ambulance
about an hour ago.

602
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:54,533
Contusions to her thighs
and upper arms.

603
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:56,265
Rape kit
was positive
for fluids.

604
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,863
She Iose
consciousness?

605
00:28:57,941 --> 00:29:00,375
Awake for the whole thing.
He hit her hard.

606
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:02,274
Bruising's pretty severe.

607
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:04,506
No sign of trauma
to the baby.

608
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:06,606
We're keeping her overnight
for observation.

609
00:29:06,683 --> 00:29:07,877
Thanks.

610
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:21,419
Who did this to you,
GIoria?

611
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,125
I don't know.

612
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:29,299
You gonna tell us
some stranger just crawled in
through your window?

613
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,936
Forget it, GIoria.

614
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:37,503
You know who did it
because you were
sleeping with him.

615
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,208
Every word
out of your mouth
has been a Iie.

616
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:42,183
Now, you want our help,
you give us his name

617
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:44,311
and you give it to us now.

618
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:54,457
Frank Barbarossa. I did...
I had a stupid fling with him.

619
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:55,589
I ended it months ago.

620
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:56,927
I thought he was over it,

621
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,902
and all this time
he was just thinking up
ways to hurt me.

622
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,131
He the father of your baby?

623
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:05,496
Mmm-hmm.

624
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:13,847
When he found out
that I married Kyle,
he went crazy.

625
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:19,915
I really did think that Kyle
killed his father. I was just
trying to protect him.

626
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:22,617
But now you think differently.
You think this

627
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,058
Frank murdered
your husband.

628
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:27,391
Yes.

629
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:31,089
He said it was my fault.

630
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:33,499
That if I keep
playing games with people,

631
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,698
sooner or Iater
that I was going to
have to pay.

632
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:38,934
And that
if I couldn't understand that,

633
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:42,910
that he would
do the same thing to me
that he did to Lawrence.

634
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:58,754
Frank Barbarossa?

635
00:30:58,828 --> 00:30:59,920
Who are you?

636
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:02,191
Police, Frankie.
You're under arrest.

637
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:03,289
What are you
arresting me for?

638
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:04,594
Raping GIoria Stanfield.

639
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,101
Rape? Wait a minute.
She was raped?

640
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,194
And beaten, tough guy.

641
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:10,171
That why you pump iron?
So you can mess up women?

642
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,401
No, no,
you guys are making a mistake,
you're making a mistake.

643
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:14,568
I didn't... I didn't rape her.
I didn't rape her.

644
00:31:14,644 --> 00:31:18,637
Then I'm glad we got
your DNA so we can clear
your good name.

645
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,180
FIN: No record.
The guy's a personal trainer.

646
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:25,119
Three of his clients Iive in
GIoria Stanfield's building.

647
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:26,348
She one of them?
No.

648
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:27,855
But he was there
the night of the murder.

649
00:31:27,924 --> 00:31:30,552
Doorman didn't mention it
because Barbarossa's
in the building all the time.

650
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:32,891
He checked in at 7:30,
out by 9:10.

651
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:34,457
To see who?

652
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,794
According to this,
one of his clients,
Greta Zabor.

653
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:38,993
But she says
the training session
ended in an hour.

654
00:31:39,068 --> 00:31:41,969
Which Ieaves half an hour
unaccounted for.

655
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:48,332
What happened to GIoria?

656
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:50,572
Ah, one of those guys
who Iikes to relive it.

657
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,080
Yeah. AII right.

658
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:54,446
Legs, arms.

659
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:55,541
Didn't touch
the face, though,

660
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:59,418
because what fun is it
to rape a movie star if you
can't recognize her, right?

661
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:03,788
Oh, my God.
What's the matter, Frankie?

662
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,886
You can't stand
the sight of
your own work?

663
00:32:06,963 --> 00:32:08,328
No, I didn't do this.

664
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:10,366
I Iove her, okay?
I would never Iay
a hand on her.

665
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:11,559
Where were you
Iast night?

666
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:12,862
FRANK: I was home.

667
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:14,028
Anyone confirm that?

668
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:15,866
No, no. I Iive alone.

669
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:18,806
Look, why do you guys think
this was me?

670
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,570
Because she fingered you.
FRANK: What?

671
00:32:20,643 --> 00:32:21,667
MUNCH: She said that
you raped her

672
00:32:21,744 --> 00:32:23,371
then threatened to kill her
Iike you killed her husband.

673
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:24,470
No, that's a Iie.

674
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:26,447
Read her statement, Frank.
We got you.

675
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:28,575
FIN: And we got your DNA
to match to the rape kit.

676
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:33,384
That alone will get you
12-and-a-half to 25 years of
personal training at Attica.

677
00:32:33,456 --> 00:32:36,892
No, man. It ain't gonna match,
because I didn't rape her.

678
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,259
Of course
there's a murder conviction.
That's another 25-to-Iife.

679
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,231
Your parole officer
hasn't even been born yet.

680
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,233
Look, I'm telling you guys,
I didn't kill anybody.

681
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:46,598
Think about this,
Frankie.

682
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:49,433
The jury sees you,
the schmuck trainer
to the rich and famous.

683
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:51,939
You're jealous,
you want what they have.

684
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,772
So you knock up the actress,
kill the husband
and set up the son.

685
00:32:54,844 --> 00:32:56,709
We got officers going through
your place right now.

686
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:57,871
You think they're gonna
find anything?

687
00:32:57,947 --> 00:32:59,244
Did you throw away
those shoes
you were wearing

688
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:00,680
when you killed
that guy?

689
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,617
I hope so, because
blood is really
hard to rub off.

690
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:05,517
FIN: Damn near impossible.

691
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:09,650
That Iying bitch.

692
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,125
Tell me about it.

693
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,498
That bitch!
I'm gonna kill her!
Sit down!

694
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:21,299
No. No, you get me a Iawyer.
You get me a Iawyer.
I don't say anything.

695
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,098
Legal Aid's backed up.

696
00:33:25,174 --> 00:33:27,074
Frankie won't have
representation
until tonight.

697
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:30,340
It doesn't matter. Once the
DNA comes back, no Iawyer's
gonna get him out of this.

698
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:33,644
Got the LUDs
on Barbarossa's cell.
Something interesting.

699
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:37,379
He got a call the night
of Fuller's murder at 8:40.

700
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:40,513
There's a missing half hour.
He's still someplace
inside that building.

701
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,217
Where was the call from?

702
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,521
BENSON: Pay phone
in the deli across the street.

703
00:33:44,594 --> 00:33:47,085
Odds are it's one
of two people,
GIoria or Kyle.

704
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:48,653
They were both out of
the apartment by then.

705
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:51,894
I doubt Kyle's gonna call
his wife's boyfriend.
It was her.

706
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:55,631
She calls Barbarossa
minutes before
he kills her husband.

707
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:56,763
Why?

708
00:33:57,774 --> 00:33:59,105
Find out.

709
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:04,173
FIN: You know this woman?

710
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:06,078
Yeah, yeah. Seen her
in the neighborhood.

711
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:07,548
Real diva, that one.

712
00:34:07,617 --> 00:34:09,482
She ever been in here?

713
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:10,985
A few nights ago.

714
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:13,818
I asked her for
an autograph, she acted
Iike I was stalking her.

715
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,654
Screw her.
She's not that good
of an actress anyway.

716
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:19,092
What'd she come
in here for?

717
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:21,756
Made a phone call
on the payphone,

718
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:23,924
then she watched out
the window
for a few minutes,

719
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,524
made one more call,
then Ieft.

720
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:26,863
What was going on
out the window?

721
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:28,426
I think she was waiting
for somebody

722
00:34:28,504 --> 00:34:30,199
to come out of the building
across the street.

723
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,138
You happen to eavesdrop
on those phone conversations?

724
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,005
No, man.
And I tried.

725
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:36,440
Thanks.

726
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:38,506
We got your message.

727
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:40,742
There's something wrong
with our DNA sample?

728
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:42,182
What did you do
to my sperm?

729
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,650
BENSON: Not a thing.

730
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:48,383
Somebody did, because
there's no way it came off
a rape victim. Look at this.

731
00:34:49,258 --> 00:34:52,056
See how the tail
of each sperm is
bent at the tip?

732
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:53,595
Yeah. What does
that tell you?

733
00:34:53,663 --> 00:34:55,187
This sperm was frozen.

734
00:34:55,264 --> 00:34:56,993
So, unless your guy
was shooting
through ice cubes,

735
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:59,159
there's no way this semen
could have come from a rape.

736
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:00,327
Do we know
whose sperm it is?

737
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:01,495
Oh, it's your guy.

738
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:04,404
Frozen or not, the DNA
from the rape kit matched
the DNA from his towel

739
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:06,965
which matched
the paternity test.

740
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:08,806
There's another thing.

741
00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:12,109
The presence of spermicide
from the rape kit sample.

742
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:13,808
Like from a condom.

743
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:17,614
That GIoria saved
after she had sex
with Frank Barbarossa.

744
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:21,646
She freezes it,
she plants it on herself
to set him up for rape.

745
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:23,824
And murder.

746
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,288
You drop the rape charges,

747
00:35:26,362 --> 00:35:29,559
he'II plead to murder two,
minimum sentencing
recommendation.

748
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:30,792
Why should we do that?

749
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,836
Because he's gonna give you
GIoria Stanfield.

750
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:38,837
He agrees to testify
against her, assuming
we can corroborate his story,

751
00:35:38,908 --> 00:35:40,842
and you've got a deal.

752
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:44,576
Go ahead.

753
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:47,043
The bitch set me up.

754
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:49,414
Frankie, just tell her
what you know, okay?

755
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:56,620
I'd have done
anything for her.

756
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:59,627
I didn't care about
the money and all that.

757
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,094
I killed the husband,
but I did it because
GIoria told me to.

758
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:07,432
CABOT: How did she
set up the murder?

759
00:36:08,738 --> 00:36:12,174
She called me that night,
and she said he was crazy,

760
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:15,938
and that if I didn't do it
right then, that he was
going to kill her.

761
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,309
Did she pay you?

762
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,575
That's not why I did it.

763
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:21,879
She said she was afraid
for her Iife.

764
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:24,784
He used to knock her
and those kids around
all the time.

765
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:27,516
If he was out of the way,
that we could be together,

766
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,716
but he'd never Iet her go.

767
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:33,251
Telling you about her
abusive husband doesn't mean
she asked you to kill him.

768
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,160
Well, how the hell you think
I got in the apartment?

769
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:36,459
She gave me
the security code.

770
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:37,863
That doesn't
prove anything.

771
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:38,958
Why the hell not?

772
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:40,297
Because you were
screwing her,

773
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,961
so she could have
given it to you
at any time.

774
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,699
Yeah, but she made up
a rape to frame me.

775
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:46,765
That proves that
she's a Iiar,
not a murderer.

776
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:47,866
The kid's baseball bat.

777
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:51,038
She told me where it was
and she told me what to do
with it when I was done.

778
00:36:51,113 --> 00:36:53,172
It was her idea
to set him up, too.

779
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:55,774
Mr. Barbarossa,
with your statement
you are the only person

780
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:57,409
going to jail for this murder.

781
00:36:57,486 --> 00:36:59,716
I need something
I can prove.

782
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:13,232
Well, I guess she's gonna
get away with it.

783
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:18,339
We arresting her?

784
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:21,535
Nothing he said definitively
points to GIoria.

785
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,670
This might.
Dumped the payphone
from the deli.

786
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:26,476
That other call
that GIoria made
went to Kyle Fuller's cell.

787
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,278
Wonder what that
conversation entailed.

788
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:31,081
"Honey, get out of the house.
Your father's about
to get murdered."

789
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:33,587
Would explain
why he's sitting in Rikers.

790
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:35,419
He thinks she did it,
he's protecting her.

791
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:36,924
You get Kyle
to testify to that,

792
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:40,156
we've got corroboration
and an indictment
against GIoria.

793
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:41,753
When's Kyle
getting released?

794
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:44,459
I'm bringing Barbarossa's
confession before a judge
tomorrow morning

795
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:46,467
to formally drop the charges.

796
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,059
Kyle's a free man by noon.

797
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:49,468
And a dead man.

798
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:50,698
He cashes in that trust,

799
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:54,038
GIoria's got no reason
to keep him around anymore.

800
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:58,304
My client's being released
within the hour, Detective,

801
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:00,849
so I'm not quite sure
what we're doing here.

802
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:02,543
You know why
they're dropping
the charges?

803
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:03,676
Because I didn't
kill my father.

804
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:04,913
They tell you
who did?

805
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:07,547
Some guy that worked
in my apartment building.

806
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:09,250
No, not some guy.

807
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:12,253
Your stepmother's
boyfriend.

808
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:16,555
You think you can just
make up these Iies
and I'm gonna believe you?

809
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,293
You've been
sitting in prison
for one reason,

810
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:21,029
your stepmother
set you up for murder.

811
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:23,070
That's not true.

812
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,300
Kyle, think about it.

813
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:30,236
The weapon was
your baseball bat,
hidden under your bed.

814
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:32,304
And whose idea
was that?

815
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:34,179
It was your
stepmother's.

816
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,877
GIoria is my wife.

817
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:38,317
Who's having
another guy's baby.

818
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:49,995
STABLER: Results of
her paternity test.
See for yourself.

819
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,304
Kyle, there's no reason
to protect her anymore.

820
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:02,344
She doesn't deserve it.

821
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:09,875
It's not true.

822
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:15,086
Can't argue with DNA.

823
00:39:22,798 --> 00:39:26,234
BENSON: She had
her boyfriend
kill your father.

824
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:33,064
And he did it because GIoria
told him that they would
Iive happily ever after.

825
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:36,577
She said the same thing
to you, didn't she?

826
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:42,780
But you couldn't kill him,
and so she got someone else
to do it.

827
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,481
But she wanted
to get married to me.

828
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:48,682
It was her idea.

829
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:51,056
So you wouldn't testify
against her.

830
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:55,887
But I would have
protected her.
She didn't have to Iie.

831
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,600
She called you that night
before you Ieft the apartment.

832
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:01,568
What'd she say to you?

833
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,604
She told me to Ieave.

834
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:12,246
That she was gonna take care
of everything, and that after
that night we'd be together.

835
00:40:17,887 --> 00:40:19,912
She told me she Ioved me.

836
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,464
Hey, can I have
your autograph?

837
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:34,830
What, are you
following me?

838
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:36,235
We heard you made
an appointment.

839
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:40,831
Family planning services.
You're getting rid
of the baby, too.

840
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,810
Guess nobody's safe
around you.

841
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,185
Hey.

842
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:00,961
What are you doing?

843
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,295
Sweetheart, I told you
why I can't have the baby.

844
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:06,857
We agreed that this was
the best thing for us.

845
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:08,096
Right.

846
00:41:08,537 --> 00:41:10,300
KYLE: But you said
it was mine.

847
00:41:10,372 --> 00:41:13,569
Which proves
we were having sex
before I was 17.

848
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,611
Kyle, this is for us.

849
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,113
No, it's not.

850
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:22,876
Look, I know
the baby isn't mine.

851
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:27,412
So if you wanna kill it,
go ahead.
I don't care anymore.

852
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,650
Kyle, please.

853
00:41:28,724 --> 00:41:30,157
Just tell me something.

854
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:35,186
This whole time
we were together,
this whole year,

855
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,799
was it all
part of your plan?

856
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,360
Make me Iove you
so I would do
whatever you wanted?

857
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:43,700
Absolutely not.

858
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:47,469
Because if it was,
you didn't have to do that.

859
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,912
You didn't have to pretend.

860
00:41:51,947 --> 00:41:54,108
I already Ioved you, GIoria.

861
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:58,251
I can't remember
when I didn't.

862
00:41:58,621 --> 00:42:00,418
I do Iove you, Kyle.

863
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:02,648
We're married.

864
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:05,922
That's why I don't wanna have
another man's baby.

865
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:10,659
Look, I only Iied to you

866
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:14,567
because I thought you were
too young to understand.
It was my mistake.

867
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:17,071
I will not Iet that
happen again.

868
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,273
I had my Iawyer do this.

869
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,011
It's for you.
BENSON: Petition
for divorce, GIoria.

870
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:31,313
You're gonna be
a free woman.

871
00:42:31,387 --> 00:42:34,754
Not for Iong, though.
You're under arrest
for murder.

872
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,214
You don't know
what you're doing, Kyle.

873
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:38,351
No.

874
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:42,295
I know exactly
what I'm doing,

875
00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:44,692
Mom.
