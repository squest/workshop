1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:00,064
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:04,799
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:06,033
In New York City,

4
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:09,009
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:12,604
are members of
an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:14,649
These are their stories.

7
00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:20,481
Love is all
very nice, darling,
but what does he really want?

8
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:27,018
Your pecan pies
or your nice,
fat bank balance?

9
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:30,261
What on earth?

10
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:32,300
Not you, dear.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,638
I think there's a dead
animal in my wisteria.

12
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:44,009
Now, if AIbert
is only after sex,

13
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,238
you have my blessing.

14
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:50,216
I mean, you're pushing 70.

15
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:54,214
How many more rides are Ieft
on the merry-go-round?

16
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:58,317
(SCREAMING)

17
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:04,832
Home owner's name
is Katerina BIundell.

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,663
Victim dropped in
on her unexpectedly.

19
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:10,227
She's in her 20s.
Wearing a maid's uniform.
No ID.

20
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:12,034
Miss BIundell
have a housekeeper?

21
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,699
No. Lives alone.

22
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:15,675
She recognize the victim
from the neighborhood?

23
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:18,269
I doubt it.
The victim has no face.

24
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,405
From the Iividity,
she's been dead a while.

25
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:21,744
Why'd you call us?

26
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:24,342
WARNER: Looks Iike a suicide,
but somebody worked
her over pretty good.

27
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,887
There's bruising
on her breasts,
buttocks, thighs.

28
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:28,149
Maybe a rape
and toss?

29
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:29,383
Some of these
are old.

30
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,255
This stuff didn't
just happen once.

31
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:32,554
BENSON: Looks Iike
she fell from there.

32
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:34,652
STABLER: Trellacker Tower.
Millionaire heaven.

33
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,357
So she Iands head first,
breaks the glass,

34
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:39,366
falls onto the plants
which hold her for a while

35
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:42,130
until Katerina
goes poking around.

36
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:44,195
She's a maid.
Probably doesn't
speak much English.

37
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:46,331
AIone in a foreign country.
If she was raped,

38
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,501
it's not surprising
she didn't call the cops.

39
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:51,011
So she takes the high dive.

40
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,740
Or she was pushed.

41
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,294
STABLER: Mr. Paysen?
Yeah.

42
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:49,667
SVU. Detective Stabler.
My partner, Detective Benson.

43
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:52,571
Now, the doorman says
that you run security
for the Lamerly family.

44
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:54,233
Yeah. SVU?
What's this about?

45
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:57,642
We've got a jumper.
Looks Iike she fell
from the penthouse.

46
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:58,940
Did you check all
the other apartments?

47
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:02,211
Well, the doorman says that
the windows don't open wide
enough to Iet a child out.

48
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:04,149
Well, why is sex crimes
interested in a suicide?

49
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,517
We believe that
she was assaulted
before she fell.

50
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:08,055
You did some
time on the job?

51
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:10,591
Put in my 20 at the 29.
When'd this happen?

52
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,149
Sometime over
the weekend.

53
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:14,195
No one's been in
the penthouse from
Friday morning

54
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:15,854
till Sunday night when
Mrs. Lamerly came home.

55
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:16,955
From where?
Connecticut.

56
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,624
The rest of the family's
still up there.

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,498
I drove Mrs. L. back early
to take in a concert.

58
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,538
There's no sign
of a break-in.

59
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:26,233
Even so, we'd Iike
to take a Iook around.

60
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:29,243
Like I said, nobody's been
here since Friday morning.

61
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:32,974
Well, we could come back
with a warrant and a couple
of TV crews if you'd Iike.

62
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,183
Just Iet me
warn the old Iady.

63
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,180
Thank you.

64
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:44,425
You think she fell
from our balcony?

65
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,982
BENSON: It seems Iikely.

66
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,529
Oh, the poor soul.
Do you know who she is?

67
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:52,727
We're working on that.
She was wearing
a housekeeper's uniform.

68
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,098
Gray dress,
white apron.

69
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,967
But all our help
had the weekend off.

70
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:59,370
STABLER: We'II need
names and addresses.

71
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,636
Of course.
Tom will get
them for you.

72
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,182
BENSON: There's our
crime scene.

73
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,310
There's no sign of
a struggle here or inside.

74
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:13,411
I still don't
understand how she
could've got out here.

75
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:16,286
We're going to need to take
a Iook at the building
security camera tapes.

76
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,552
Ma'am, please don't
touch the railing.

77
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:20,356
I'm sorry. Is this
where she fell?

78
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,452
Looks Iike it.

79
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,054
We're going to have to have
a Crime Scene Unit come up
here and check things out.

80
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:25,463
Of course.

81
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,070
Lamerly money comes
from Iate Grandpa's
real estate business.

82
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:31,765
He had the cash,
Grandma had the class.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,467
Son Douglas runs
everything now.

84
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,532
Wife Iives in Bermuda
and rarely comes ashore.

85
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,599
Kids?

86
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:39,044
Yeah, one son, Drew,
just back from Europe.

87
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:40,308
And what about Granny?

88
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:43,874
She hosts tea parties
and presides over
a dozen charitable events.

89
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:45,544
Their story hold up?

90
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,248
Doorman said that
the penthouse had
no visitors over the weekend,

91
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:50,723
but he can't see who comes
in through the garage.

92
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,056
FIN: This is off
the penthouse Iobby camera.

93
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:55,096
4:45 p.m. Saturday.

94
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:58,892
She's got her own key.
Any pictures of her face?

95
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:02,095
Now, that would be too easy.
And that's it.

96
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,762
She's the only one who
went into the penthouse

97
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:06,170
till Gran and the chauffeur
come home Sunday evening.

98
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:07,936
Any reports of
missing servants?

99
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,239
AII present and
accounted for.

100
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,609
So who is this woman?

101
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:19,080
I'm running prints,
dental, DNA.

102
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:22,146
There's too much bone damage
to try facial reconstruction.

103
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:24,123
Tested her for
drugs and alcohol.
She's clean.

104
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,454
Did you get anything
from the rape kit?

105
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:26,687
No fluids.

106
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:30,288
But traces of
Iubricant and spermicide.
Her attacker used a condom.

107
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,595
Can you connect the assault
to the time of death?

108
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:36,899
Most of the bruises
and strap marks are old,
but there are petechiae here.

109
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,439
Broken capillaries
that didn't have
time to form bruises.

110
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,975
So she was raped, beaten,
and went up to
the penthouse to die?

111
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:44,807
Or she Iikes rough sex.
None of this proves
she was raped.

112
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,109
Hands around
the throat could be
erotic asphyxiation.

113
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:50,151
The strap marks could be
the badge of an S&M junkie.

114
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,914
Possible. The degree
of violence is pretty
controlled.

115
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,615
Another thing,
CSU only found one shoe.

116
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,282
They're still Iooking
for the second one.

117
00:05:58,326 --> 00:05:59,953
Pretty high-end for a maid.

118
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:04,156
Nice stockings, too.

119
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:07,668
Okay, she's wearing
high heels, fancy underwear,
dresses Iike a maid,

120
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:10,296
and Iets herself into
a rich man's apartment?

121
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:12,704
Sounds Iike an out-call
fantasy to me.

122
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,139
My God.

123
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:18,640
I think it's Anna.

124
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,080
I can't believe
she'd do this.

125
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,140
Who's Anna,
Mr. Lamerly?

126
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,710
Anna Rivera.

127
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,448
She worked
a month for us,

128
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:30,286
and then we Iearned
that she Iied about
her Iegal status.

129
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,916
Last week we
had to Iet her go.

130
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:34,427
Do you always check
the immigration
status of your staff?

131
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:35,929
We Iead public Iives,
Detective.

132
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,624
We have to be able
to withstand scrutiny.

133
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,894
Do you have any idea
why Anna would kill herself?

134
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,464
She was very upset
about Iosing the job.

135
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:45,699
She begged us
not to fire her.

136
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:48,265
But I honestly never
thought she'd do this.

137
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:51,312
The severance
was very generous.
Three months' salary.

138
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,677
That'II put a dent
in the bank account.

139
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,876
Did Anna usually wear
shoes Iike this to work?

140
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:58,475
I have no idea.

141
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,384
I don't inspect
the staff's shoes.

142
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:03,618
She was wearing
stiletto heels
and expensive underwear.

143
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:06,091
I don't think she came up
to polish the credenza.

144
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:07,458
What are you trying
to say, Detective?

145
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,589
Whoever abused Anna
made a habit of it.

146
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,392
Her body showed signs
of repeated, violent sex.

147
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:14,992
Well, what has that
got to do with me?

148
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,334
Anna came to this
apartment to die,
Mr. Lamerly.

149
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,668
Why do you think
she did that?

150
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:22,141
You can't honestly
think I have anything
to do with this.

151
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,939
How well did
your son know her?

152
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:25,673
Where was he
Saturday night?

153
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:28,375
In Connecticut.
We all were.

154
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:33,114
You barge in here,
no warrant, no nothing,
making wild accusations...

155
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,383
Douglas, please.
Don't shout.

156
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,725
Police have to
do their job.

157
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,318
BENSON: Do you know
where Anna used to Iive?

158
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:43,728
My son will get
you the address.

159
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:45,993
LAYTON: Detectives?

160
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:48,825
Something you should see.

161
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:51,429
BENSON: Prints.

162
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:52,871
Took the same prints
on the balcony door.

163
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:54,875
Was she alone?
Far as I can tell.

164
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:56,808
There's only the one set.
What about inside?

165
00:07:56,878 --> 00:08:00,177
Nothing. PIace is immaculate.
But, hey, Granny Iooks
Iike a clean freak.

166
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:03,615
So our victim gets attacked
someplace else but comes here
to kill herself?

167
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:06,677
She came straight out here,
she climbs over the edge,

168
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,016
she holds onto the railing.

169
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,080
Smearing suggests
she didn't Iet go
right away.

170
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:12,251
She changed her mind.
She tried to pull herself up.

171
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:13,521
STABLER: Wasn't strong enough.

172
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:14,857
Anna's address.

173
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,600
BENSON: Mr. Karenn,
when was the Iast
time you saw Anna?

174
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,967
When she paid her rent.
Tuesday.

175
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:25,630
Did she pay you
for the whole month?

176
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,800
Wouldn't be
Iiving here
otherwise.

177
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,338
She ever bring
boyfriends here?

178
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,379
No. Is she in trouble?

179
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,573
That's what we're
trying to find out.

180
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,207
This her?

181
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:37,877
Yeah.

182
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,045
You got any
numbers or addresses
for her family?

183
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:43,022
Said she was from
Guatemala. Try there.

184
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,456
Can't find a note.

185
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:47,451
What was Anna Iike,
Mr. Karenn?

186
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,363
Quiet, clean.
She paid her rent.
Perfect.

187
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:56,168
Then I guess
you'd be real upset
to find out she's dead.

188
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,534
Oh, jeez.

189
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:59,997
What am I going to
do with her stuff?

190
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,008
Why don't you
send it to Guatemala?

191
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:05,307
We'II take these for the M.E.
so she can make a positive ID.

192
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,440
Can't get anything
off of these for DNA.
They're brand new.

193
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:11,883
Oh, well, that figures.
AII right, I'II have CSU
comb the place.

194
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:13,318
Take a Iook
at this first.

195
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,584
Lots of fine cuts,
some healed, some new.

196
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,957
BENSON: From cleaning
a penthouse?

197
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:21,086
I swabbed her hands.

198
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,357
Didn't find any
household cleaners
that a maid would use.

199
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,661
Only an acetone
called Rexton,

200
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,293
exclusively used
in cleaning
motion picture film.

201
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:31,066
Early 20s,
handles Iots of film.

202
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,606
Could be a
film student.

203
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:35,274
The Lamerlys were
definitely in Connecticut.

204
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:37,607
Had some Iocal muckety-mucks
over for dinner.

205
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,978
Son Drew even got his picture
taken up there running a red
Iight in his Iittle Audi.

206
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,516
6:10 p.m.

207
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,983
Anything on
the film schools?

208
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:45,417
Thanks.

209
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,886
Any idea how many
film schools there
are in New York?

210
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,356
PIus a student failing
to show up for class
on Monday morning

211
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,689
is not exactly going
to set off alarms.

212
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,421
Any chance Anna
was taking classes?

213
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:57,430
Well, not unless she
went by the name of
Carmen Trancoso.

214
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:00,797
Carmen was supposed
to screen her first-year
film at the New School.

215
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:04,429
She didn't show. The girl she
made it with said she hasn't
seen her since Saturday.

216
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:11,835
Suzie, you knew her
well. Has Carmen been
upset Iately?

217
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:13,972
Why? Tell me
what's going on.

218
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,310
We're worried
about her.

219
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:17,112
Does she Ieave her
personal stuff here?

220
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:18,846
This is hers.

221
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,419
And this stuff.

222
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,148
Yeah? Where's Carmen from?

223
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,194
Sao Paulo, Brazil.

224
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,661
Well, she have a hard
time adjusting here?

225
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:34,634
She does okay
considering her
English isn't too good.

226
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,260
Is this Carmen?

227
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:39,702
She's a beautiful girl.

228
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:40,866
Does she have
a boyfriend?

229
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:44,844
Used to. They broke up.
Carmen was pretty upset.

230
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,277
BENSON: She talk
to you about it?

231
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,405
Not really.

232
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,382
Well, what'd
she say about it?

233
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,315
That she was going
to make him pay.

234
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,852
Well, do you think Carmen
was upset enough to try
to hurt herself?

235
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,688
What do you mean?
Is that what's happened?

236
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:02,059
We don't know,
but we have to Iook at
all the possibilities.

237
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,995
What's her
boyfriend's name?

238
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:05,862
Drew. Drew Lamerly.

239
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:09,464
M.E. confirms.

240
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:12,199
The DNA off
the Iipstick proves
that the dead girl

241
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,798
is Drew Lamerly's ex,
Carmen Trancoso.

242
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:18,277
So he dumps her, she goes
to his apartment for an
attention-seeking suicide?

243
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:20,041
Dresses as the maid
to get by the doorman.

244
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,844
She uses a key that
either Drew gave her
or she stole it.

245
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,044
What about Anna Rivera?
Vanished.

246
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,553
Customs has no record
of her on any flights
out of New York.

247
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:30,591
And if she's going to go home,
why not take all of her stuff
with her?

248
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,853
Look who's here.
Poster boy.

249
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,152
Hi. Can we help you?

250
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,896
My name is Drew Lamerly.

251
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,327
Suzie called me.

252
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:41,891
I think I should
make a statement.

253
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,204
About what?

254
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:45,534
Carmen Trancoso.

255
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:50,468
It's my fault
she's dead.

256
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:56,875
Carmen and I went
out for about a month.

257
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,179
It was intense.

258
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:01,221
So intense it scared me.
I broke up with her.

259
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,620
When'd you break up?

260
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,284
About ten days ago.
She took it bad.

261
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,259
She kept coming
to the apartment,
following me around.

262
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,023
When was the Iast time
you talked to her, Drew?

263
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:11,759
Saturday. She called me,
begged me to see her.

264
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,825
I said I was with
my family in the country.
She became hysterical.

265
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,234
Said she'd make me sorry
if I didn't come over.

266
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,364
So I told her to get
a Iife and I hung up.

267
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:24,705
If I'd just gone there,
been kind to her,
she might still be alive.

268
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,945
What time did
she call you?

269
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:29,578
Around 5:30, I think.

270
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,550
So Anna Rivera
isn't dead then.

271
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:33,484
No, she's not.

272
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:36,523
One of the other
maids just heard from her.
Turns out she's in Miami.

273
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,889
Why'd she run and Ieave
everything behind?

274
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,488
Well, she didn't.
Her aunt was really sick
and she had to go see her.

275
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:46,055
Aunt is sick.

276
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:48,358
I'm missing something here.

277
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,735
Drew, why did your dad say
the dead girl was Anna?

278
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,673
He got all teary-eyed
and everything.

279
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,709
Well, the girl in the tape
Iooks just Iike Anna.

280
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:57,142
She's wearing
a maid's uniform.

281
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,906
Well, so was Carmen.

282
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,015
Why is that?

283
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,484
She knew she couldn't
get into the building
any other way.

284
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,487
I'd told the doorman
not to Iet her in.

285
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,053
Carmen got by him dressed
as a maid. She get a copy
of your key?

286
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,323
Yes, which she must have
taken from me while I was
sleeping and duped it.

287
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,387
You guys spent
the night together
a Iot, right?

288
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:20,229
Well, I told you,
it was a very
intense relationship.

289
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,534
You call beating
the crap out of
her intense, huh?

290
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,073
You Iittle prick,
you did this to her.

291
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,575
Yes, I did do this,
but she wanted me to.

292
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,339
No. No woman wants this.

293
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,505
Carmen did!
This was her thing.

294
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,776
So you beat and rape her
because it was her thing?

295
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,182
I never raped her.
She Iiked it.

296
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,982
It was never enough, though.
She wanted more.

297
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,920
She wanted more of what?

298
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,458
She... She wanted me to...

299
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,517
She wanted me to choke her
until she blacked out.

300
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:49,426
But I couldn't do that.
I couldn't.

301
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,260
That's when I knew
it was too much.

302
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,766
I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry, okay?

303
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,492
(SIGHS)

304
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,901
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,131
Drew's story checked out.

306
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,733
We got a 10-minute call
from the penthouse
to Connecticut.

307
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,334
5:32 p.m. Saturday.

308
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:05,470
What about the bruising?

309
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,845
M.E. said the violence
was controlled. So it
could have been consensual.

310
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,383
What's your take
on this kid?

311
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,385
He's got answers
for everything.

312
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,388
Fin, you and Munch see
if Drew's got history.
But do it quietly.

313
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:18,323
I don't want the Lamerlys
complaining to the brass
that we're harassing them.

314
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:21,122
You know,
this is Carmen's
date book.

315
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,221
She met with
this Roger Burnbaum
three times Iast week.

316
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,526
There's a number here.

317
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,965
Another boyfriend?

318
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:28,728
Maybe it was Drew
who didn't end it.

319
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:31,294
Maybe Carmen dumped him
for this Roger Burnbaum.

320
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:32,737
Guess who I'm holding for.

321
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:36,368
Roger Burnbaum and DeLisle,
personal injury Iawyers.

322
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:37,775
She was suing someone.

323
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:43,140
We represent Carmen Trancoso,
but I can't say why
without her permission.

324
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,048
She can't give it.
She's dead.

325
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,518
What happened?

326
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:47,918
She committed suicide.

327
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:49,581
So I hope
you're paid up.

328
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,852
We take cases on
a contingency basis.

329
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:53,359
No win, no fee.

330
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,486
That's noble of you.
What was Carmen
hoping to win?

331
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:59,260
A substantial settlement
from her ex-boyfriend
for rape.

332
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,701
Her ex-boyfriend
being Drew Lamerly.

333
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,532
How do you know?
She said she
hadn't told anybody.

334
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,367
Carmen died by
throwing herself 20 floors
from the Lamerly penthouse.

335
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,139
STABLER: She have
a good case against him?

336
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,113
To be honest, no.

337
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:18,344
She told me her sex Iife
with Mr. Lamerly had gotten
increasingly violent.

338
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,319
She tried to break up,
he pursued her.

339
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:22,356
When she resisted,
he raped and beat her.

340
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,118
And how is that
not a good case?

341
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,352
She refused to report
the rape to the police.

342
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,725
Afraid it might
affect her student visa.

343
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,854
BENSON: Did you believe her?

344
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,956
I believe
he hurt her very badly,

345
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,001
but I wasn't
sure he raped her.

346
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:35,467
But you took the case anyway.

347
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:38,027
Yes. I thought they'd settle.

348
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:41,268
If you were the Lamerlys,
would you want this
sort of publicity?

349
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,537
LAMERLY: Detectives,
our attorney, Lorna Scarry.

350
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,845
Funny, we just came from
Carmen Trancoso's attorney.

351
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,317
How is Mr. DeLisle?
Hit by any ambulances Iately?

352
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,650
He's sad that he won't
be trying his case.

353
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,314
Oh, pity.

354
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,553
Just when he thought
the gravy train had
stopped at his station.

355
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:00,686
You see a raped woman
as a gravy train?

356
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:02,320
I swear to you
I never raped her.

357
00:16:02,397 --> 00:16:03,523
Drew.

358
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:06,294
Believe me, officers,
I am sorry for the girl's
death,

359
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,063
but she was unbalanced.

360
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:10,195
She tried emotional blackmail,
she tried the Iaw,

361
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:14,572
and when she realized that
we weren't going to cave in to
her outrageous claims,

362
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:15,769
she killed herself.

363
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:19,678
Well, the marks on
Carmen's body support
those outrageous claims.

364
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:21,306
I told you,
that's what she wanted.

365
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:24,614
Well, that's easy to say,
given she's not here
to defend herself.

366
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:25,983
Can you prove it?

367
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:28,454
It's not our job to prove.
But we can.

368
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:31,826
Affidavits from
three of Carmen's
former boyfriends,

369
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,758
two of whom
she picked up in bars.

370
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,854
They testified that
she was an animal.

371
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,058
The rougher the sex,
the better.

372
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,194
So our victim is now a
gold-digging whore and we are
totally being jerked around.

373
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:45,000
Every time we come
up with something,

374
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:48,167
the Lamerlys are ready
and waiting with some
plausible explanation.

375
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:49,232
What've you got?

376
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:50,903
Facts and figures
on Drew Lamerly.

377
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:54,312
Your typical red-blooded,
all-American boy with an
eight-figure trust fund.

378
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:58,581
Wrapped a few sports cars
around Iampposts,
a few parking tickets,

379
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,780
but no record,
no ex-girlfriends
crying rape.

380
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:02,585
He's popular.
PIayed hockey and tennis.

381
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:04,124
Good enough for any
college varsity team.

382
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:07,093
Except he didn't graduate
high school. He spent three
years at college in Paris.

383
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:09,630
Well, you know what I think?
I think we've got nothing
we can prove

384
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:13,998
and too many cases with real,
Iive victims to waste time
chasing shadows.

385
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,165
Now, see if there's a reason
Drew didn't graduate.
If there isn't, case closed.

386
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:22,471
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

387
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:26,503
I'm afraid the Radleigh School
didn't quite meet
Drew Lamerly's needs.

388
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:27,775
Can you translate
that for me?

389
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:30,283
We expelled him. Pity.
He was a good student.

390
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:31,512
What did he do?

391
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,247
Disrupted our senior prom.

392
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:36,757
He brought a very attractive
older woman as his date.

393
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:40,124
I suspect it was to show off,
but she seemed out of her
element.

394
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:41,662
Kind of girl you
don't bring home
to Mom and Dad.

395
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,788
Precisely.

396
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:45,094
Well, it still doesn't
explain why you kicked
him out.

397
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:50,697
To cut a sordid story short,
they both got drunk,
there was an altercation.

398
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:53,866
The woman called the police
and accused Drew
of assaulting her.

399
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:56,739
Did he?

400
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,712
The police didn't
seem to think so.

401
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,476
And neither,
in the cold Iight of day,
did the young woman.

402
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,643
She dropped the charges.

403
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:07,245
However, school policy
is very clear on
these matters.

404
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:09,620
No alcohol.
He had to go.

405
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:11,318
Do you remember
the young woman's name?

406
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,952
It was five years ago.

407
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:18,621
Radleigh High prom
gives us a date,
May 16th, '97.

408
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,930
We're at the 29 now. Yeah.

409
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:23,163
AII right,
we'II be in touch,
Captain.

410
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:24,730
Anything?

411
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:25,966
There's no 61.

412
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,933
You mean no one
filed a complaint?

413
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,274
Oh, they filed a complaint,
but the 61's disappeared.

414
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:33,871
Looks Iike the Lamerlys
are sweeping up after
Drew again.

415
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:36,474
This time they
missed some dirt.

416
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:39,145
One of the cops
filled out an "Aided" card.

417
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:41,348
They're not kept
in the same place
as the 61s.

418
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:44,483
Nope. Card gives the
assault victim's name
as a Miss Jenny White, 24.

419
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,687
She refused medical
assistance, but she
did give us an address.

420
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,100
I'm Camilla Hartnell.
Can I help you?

421
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:56,501
Yeah. Detective Benson,
this is Detective Stabler,
SVU.

422
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:59,563
We'd Iike to speak
to a Miss Jenny White.

423
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:03,133
Jenny gave this address
in a complaint that
she made to the police.

424
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,303
When?

425
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:07,473
About five years ago.
She was assaulted
at a high school prom.

426
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:08,880
It's taken you
this Iong to respond?

427
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,417
Well, we have some
new information.

428
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:14,114
I'm sorry, I... I've Iived
here for 20 years and I don't
know a Jenny White.

429
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,281
You know him?

430
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:16,415
No.

431
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:20,895
Oh, Frank, hi!
See you tonight
at around 6:00. Bye.

432
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:23,453
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

433
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:24,897
No. Thank you so much.

434
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:26,228
BENSON: It's a dead end.
Maybe.

435
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:28,098
I think we need
to talk to the cops
who took the statement.

436
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,364
STABLER: Wait, check this out.

437
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:31,735
Want to go get
a cup of coffee?
Come on, come on.

438
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:33,205
Yeah, okay.

439
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:37,873
I think one of
Mrs. Hartnell's girls just
decided not to come home.

440
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:39,208
PIace is a brothel.

441
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,504
(KNOCKING)

442
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:46,948
Oh, you're still here.

443
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:50,480
Yeah, and we're going to stay
here until you start telling
us the truth.

444
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,651
I have told
you the truth.

445
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:54,217
Then your memory's
not serving you correctly.

446
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:55,593
Jenny White works for you,

447
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:56,892
and if you don't
tell us where she is,

448
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:57,660
we're going to have
Vice tear this place apart.

449
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,360
Do you really think
I'm afraid of Vice?

450
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:00,834
AII I need to do is
make one phone call...

451
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:02,495
Great. Why don't you go
ahead and do that then?

452
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:04,164
Excuse me,
but where do you
think you're going?

453
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,401
AII right, Iisten up.
NYPD. This is a raid.

454
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:07,737
Everyone up
against this wall.

455
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,902
BENSON: Let's go.
You, all of you out of here.

456
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:10,002
Stand right there.
Come on.

457
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,947
PIease, don't do this. Don't.
I'II tell you, I'II tell you.

458
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:17,209
Jenny White stopped working
here three years ago.

459
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,583
BENSON: Where is she?

460
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:21,851
Married to Angus Rochester,
one of the richest men
in Manhattan.

461
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:25,451
And I think you'II find
she's similarly disinclined
to remember the past.

462
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,887
Excuse me,
Jennifer White?

463
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,566
I'm sorry,
my name's Rochester.

464
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:36,102
Prom night,
Radleigh High School.
Remember?

465
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:38,297
I don't know what
you're talking about.

466
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:41,571
Sure you do. We spoke
to your former employer,
Mrs. Hartnell.

467
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,202
Drew Lamerly ring a bell?

468
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:47,047
We believe he raped
another young woman
who recently killed herself.

469
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:49,743
ANGUS: Jen!

470
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:53,484
Lady, we don't care
who you were or who you are.

471
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,786
Just yes or no,
did Drew Lamerly
rape you?

472
00:20:56,892 --> 00:20:58,359
Yes, he raped me.

473
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:01,760
But if you ask me anything
in front of my husband,
I will deny it.

474
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,095
Oh, who's that?

475
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,067
ANGUS: Hi, hon.
Hi, sweetie.

476
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,161
Stabler. Yeah.

477
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,005
So now Drew gets
away with it again.

478
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:16,669
Maybe Drew's
Iuck just ran out.

479
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:22,115
Something was bugging me
about Carmen's suicide,
the arc of the fall.

480
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:24,118
So I had the boys
set up a simulation.

481
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:26,051
Digital model of
Trellacker Tower.

482
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:28,590
The M.E. gave us
Carmen's weight,
factored in building height,

483
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:31,650
wind speed,
body's acceleration.

484
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:35,163
If Carmen just Iet go of
the railing or simply stepped
off it, this is what happens.

485
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:42,931
BENSON: She falls into
the yard next door.

486
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:45,633
Five yards short
of where she actually
Ianded.

487
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,235
But if she's given some
Iateral propulsion from
the railing, we get this.

488
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:57,545
Lateral propulsion.
She was pushed.

489
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,985
That's right.

490
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:04,015
Wait, but the prints show
that she was over the railing
clinging onto the edge.

491
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:06,357
Yeah, but if she's pushed
back against the railing,

492
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:09,489
she'd be gripping it
in exactly the same way.

493
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,795
So he pushes her
further and further,

494
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,802
she fights, she kicks him,
the shoe comes off,

495
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,170
but his body weight is
against her, she can't
hold anymore, she goes over.

496
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:22,005
Not suicide, murder.

497
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,183
So somebody pushed
Carmen off the roof.

498
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,480
For all the evidence
you've got, it might
as well be a ghost.

499
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:32,384
That ghost is
Drew Lamerly.

500
00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:35,686
Wouldn't be the first rich kid
who thinks he's entitled
to treat women how he wants.

501
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:38,283
You only have
the two rape cases,
Jenny White and Carmen?

502
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:40,056
Well, one can't talk
and the other one won't.

503
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:41,687
We've been Iooking.
Can't find anyone else.

504
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:45,131
But who knows how many others
were bought off or intimidated
into silence?

505
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:46,463
Okay, what's your
next move?

506
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:48,833
Well, Fin's checking
on why the cops buried

507
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:50,929
Jenny White's 61
from five years ago.

508
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:54,203
CSU just found the other shoe
stuck in a tree
nearly half a block away.

509
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:56,107
They're running tests.

510
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:58,043
It's Drew, Captain,
and I'm going to put
him on that balcony.

511
00:22:58,114 --> 00:23:00,309
Well, your first
problem is

512
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:05,252
to explain how he is running
a red Iight in Connecticut
at the time of Carmen's death.

513
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:08,688
What if he's not Drew?
Baseball cap is
covering half his face.

514
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:11,818
Well, it doesn't help us
if it's not a positive ID.

515
00:23:11,894 --> 00:23:14,590
Isn't there some work
you could be doing, John?

516
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:15,823
I am working.

517
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:19,265
The techs checked the security
tape after Carmen entered
the penthouse.

518
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,360
Came up with zip.
I've been Iooking at
it before she arrived.

519
00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:22,563
I think I got something.

520
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:24,538
Look at the second
hand on the clock.

521
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:26,837
It stops and then
it jumps forward.

522
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,638
BENSON: Ten seconds
are missing.

523
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:30,442
Somebody cut it
out of that tape.

524
00:23:30,513 --> 00:23:32,845
The doorman said
that a repairman
from tower security

525
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:35,509
came by Sunday morning
to do a maintenance check.

526
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:37,643
So at 4:15,
half an hour
before Carmen arrived,

527
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,153
we've got someone
entering that penthouse.

528
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:40,449
He was waiting for her.

529
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:45,253
That call from the penthouse
to Connecticut at 5:30 wasn't
from Carmen,

530
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:47,955
it was from Drew,
calling home
to say what happened.

531
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,830
Dad jumps into Drew's car,
runs a red Iight,
it's an instant alibi.

532
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:55,393
So Drew kills Carmen
but Ieaves no trace of
himself on her or the balcony

533
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:58,804
and he's clever enough to make
sure that Carmen's prints
are Ieft on the railing?

534
00:23:58,874 --> 00:24:00,307
This kid had to have help.

535
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:04,608
He did.
Guess which cop interviewed
Jenny White five years ago?

536
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,274
Tom Paysen,
the Lamerlys' Mr. Fix-it.

537
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:12,712
PIot's starting to unravel,
Tom. We know about Jenny,
the camera...

538
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:13,812
I don't follow you.

539
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:16,722
Drew calls Carmen,
tells her to come
over to his penthouse.

540
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,157
"Let's try to
work things out."

541
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:20,991
Then he tells her to dress
as a maid so the doorman
doesn't recognize her.

542
00:24:21,063 --> 00:24:24,555
Yeah, and Carmen comes over,
she still Ioves Drew,
but they fight.

543
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,965
So he rapes her
and pushes her
off the balcony.

544
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:28,731
That's when
the cover-ups begin.

545
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:32,472
Word from the Iocal precinct
is the jumper has no face.

546
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:36,877
Cover up number one,
girl's in a maid's uniform,
why not call her Anna Rivera?

547
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:41,576
FIN: Anna gets moved out,
place gets cleaned so the DNA
doesn't mess up the story.

548
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,413
But the dumb old cops
figure out
it's Carmen anyway.

549
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:44,976
Cover up number two,

550
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:49,252
Carmen's a nut and a whore
who offs herself because
she Ioses her rich boyfriend.

551
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:50,656
But who could have
fixed all this?

552
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:54,321
Somebody who knows
how the police think,
how they work.

553
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:56,089
You.

554
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:02,831
I got to hand it
to you guys. SVU.

555
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:05,840
I thought you were
just the panty police,
but you're right up there.

556
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:07,000
Up where?

557
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:11,172
Dreamland.
Carmen was a mixed-up kid
who committed suicide.

558
00:25:11,247 --> 00:25:13,215
Look at the evidence,
you dumb bastards.

559
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:16,718
Evidence you manufactured.
You cut 10 seconds
off that security tape.

560
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:18,582
How many more cover-ups
you think this clown's got?

561
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:19,678
I don't have to
Iisten to this.

562
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:21,848
You've been off
the job so Iong
you forgot the Iaw.

563
00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:22,982
Yeah, what Iaw?

564
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:27,051
The ones you broke, hindering
a police investigation,
tampering with evidence.

565
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:28,994
Make yourself at home.

566
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,364
I'm sorry
to have kept you
waiting, Detectives.

567
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:39,133
I was getting changed.

568
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:43,304
My son isn't back from
the city yet and I'm afraid
I have to go out.

569
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:44,778
Yet another
charity dinner.

570
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,815
Mrs. Lamerly, we need
to speak with your grandson.

571
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:49,407
But that's not possible,
Drew's my escort tonight.

572
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:51,077
Detectives, what is it?

573
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:53,053
We know that you were
in the penthouse with Carmen.

574
00:25:53,122 --> 00:25:54,384
So what'd you do
to her up there?

575
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:55,923
What are you
talking about?

576
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:57,688
He was with us that night.
Tell them, Drew.

577
00:25:57,761 --> 00:26:00,161
Look, can we do
this somewhere else?
My grandmother's not well.

578
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,720
Drew, we know
about the cover-up.

579
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,699
Are you saying
Drew hurt that girl?
That's not possible.

580
00:26:04,768 --> 00:26:06,133
He couldn't do
such a thing.

581
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:08,193
Oh, yeah?
Jenny White.

582
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,200
That name mean
anything to you?

583
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,766
(SIGHS)

584
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:16,878
I knew this would
come out eventually.

585
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:19,245
I told you,
I told your father.
He wouldn't Iisten.

586
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,145
You told him what?

587
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:25,177
That Drew should
take his punishment
for hurting Jenny.

588
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:26,884
So you admit
that he did it?

589
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:31,489
Well, why didn't you speak up
then instead of shipping him
off to Paris?

590
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:34,496
One's instinct is to protect
one's children, Detective.

591
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:36,690
But I insisted
Drew get help.

592
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,030
Six months in
a psychiatric hospital.

593
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:41,297
He was a child then.
He's grown up now.

594
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:42,599
And become a murderer.

595
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:47,032
Drew didn't do
anything to Carmen.

596
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,841
Test him.

597
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:51,278
You have Iie detectors,
don't you? Test him.

598
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:53,179
If he didn't kill Carmen,
who did?

599
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,283
Tom Paysen,
our security man.

600
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:00,380
He was obsessed with Carmen.
He wasn't here on Saturday
night.

601
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,324
How can I make
you believe me?

602
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:08,020
Take the polygraph test.

603
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,129
HUANG: How would you
describe your childhood?
Was it happy or unhappy?

604
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:16,962
Pretty happy.

605
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:19,569
Did you get along
with your parents?

606
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:23,475
It's...
Am I being tested yet?

607
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,641
This is
the pre-test interview.

608
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:29,080
I asked you about
your relationship
with your parents.

609
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:35,185
Well, I mean,
it's okay, I guess.

610
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,521
My mom is not well.
Hasn't been for a while.

611
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:42,597
Dad's working
all the time.

612
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,759
So I guess you could say
we're mutually indifferent.

613
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,227
MAN: We're set.

614
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:48,634
I'm going to
show you some cards

615
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:50,332
and I'm going
to try to guess
what each one of them is.

616
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:53,838
You must answer no
even if I guess correctly.

617
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:57,944
Is it the four of hearts?

618
00:27:58,014 --> 00:27:59,106
No.

619
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:03,910
Is it the king of spades?

620
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:05,181
No.

621
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:09,224
Is it the eight of diamonds?

622
00:28:10,193 --> 00:28:11,785
No.

623
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,053
It is the eight, isn't it?

624
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:21,732
HUANG: The graph clearly
registers the Iie.

625
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,565
No way out then, huh?

626
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:29,705
Are you ready?

627
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:33,375
Is your name Drew Lamerly?

628
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,542
Yes.

629
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:36,414
Have you ever
stolen from a friend?

630
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:38,914
No.

631
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:41,550
Have you ever forced a woman
to have sex with you?

632
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:46,287
Yes.

633
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,199
Was that woman
Jenny White?

634
00:28:53,136 --> 00:28:54,603
Yes.

635
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,439
Did you force Carmen Trancoso
to have sex with you?

636
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:02,435
No.

637
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:08,640
Did you murder
Carmen Trancoso?

638
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:12,913
No.

639
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:21,863
The polygraph says
he's being truthful.

640
00:29:22,832 --> 00:29:24,094
But I think he's Iying.

641
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,566
What, he's using
countermeasures?

642
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:27,865
Yeah, Iike a pebble
in the shoe,
breathing control.

643
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:30,405
Anything to manipulate
his body's
physiological response.

644
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:31,838
Well, how do you know
that from the test?

645
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,239
I ran a Control
Questions Test

646
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:35,402
which means that I included
non-relevant questions

647
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:37,537
which could still
provoke a guilty response.

648
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:38,876
Like, "Have you ever
stolen from a friend?"

649
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:40,006
HUANG: Right.

650
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,880
Drew was taught
how to spot
the control questions

651
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:44,476
and how to adjust
his body's response
accordingly.

652
00:29:45,188 --> 00:29:49,386
The polygraph shows a guilty
response for, "Have you ever
stolen from a friend?"

653
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:55,196
But almost no response
for the relevant question,

654
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:57,256
"Did you murder
Carmen Trancoso?"

655
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,591
Well, couldn't that
mean he is innocent?

656
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:02,103
It could, but I think
he fooled the machine.

657
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:04,606
He ramped up
his body's response
to the control questions

658
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:06,608
to cover up his Iies
about killing Carmen.

659
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:08,974
He wanted to take the test.
He knew he'd pass.

660
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:10,307
HUANG: Exactly.

661
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:12,336
Captain.

662
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:14,280
You get anything
out of Tom Paysen?

663
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,978
He denies murdering
the girl and won't
roll over on the kid.

664
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:18,714
Even though
the Lamerlys
gave him up.

665
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:20,551
He's a cop.
He knows we have
no case against him.

666
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:23,353
Even if you get him for
tampering, the most he'II
get is a couple of years.

667
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:25,155
And one hell of
a Christmas bonus.

668
00:30:25,228 --> 00:30:28,789
If we can't put Drew on that
balcony with Carmen,
we got no case against him.

669
00:30:28,865 --> 00:30:30,127
Thanks.

670
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,101
Maybe we do.
CSU found something.

671
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,633
There are traces of suede
in the abrasions on
the heel of Carmen's shoe.

672
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:39,904
BIue-dyed calfskin,
pretty nice material.

673
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:42,740
So it Iooks Iike something
caught in the heel,
Iike a blue suede jacket.

674
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:44,211
Is that enough
for a warrant?

675
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,407
How many suede jackets are
running around Manhattan?

676
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:49,383
This suede was produced
by a toxic tanning process.

677
00:30:49,452 --> 00:30:50,476
For starters,

678
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:53,681
they used a hexavalent
instead of a polyvalent
chrome to clean the Ieather.

679
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:54,848
Okay, which means?

680
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:58,360
Not made in the U.S.
Probably comes from
one of your Baltic states.

681
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:00,794
If your perp has the jacket,
I can match it.

682
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:06,561
What's going on?

683
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:08,126
We have a warrant to
search Drew's room.

684
00:31:08,204 --> 00:31:09,933
What on earth for?

685
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:17,811
Kid's got taste.

686
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:19,314
Detectives,
can I help you?

687
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:21,009
We're helping ourselves,
thanks.

688
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:22,244
EIIiot.

689
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:27,423
Heel made
an impression.

690
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:32,288
Drew Lamerly,
turn around. Turn around.

691
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:35,426
You're under arrest
for the murder of
Carmen Trancoso.

692
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:38,491
You have the right
to remain silent.
If you give up that right,

693
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:41,696
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court
of Iaw.

694
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:43,466
You have the right
to an attorney...

695
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:48,139
Okay, want to deal?

696
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:50,641
Getting cold feet,
Lorna?

697
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:51,839
Hardly.

698
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:55,248
Man two. He does five years
in a psychiatric institution.

699
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:58,950
Your client inflicts
a terrifying death
on a young woman

700
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:01,013
and you want him
to get counseling?

701
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,524
No. Murder two.
He does 25 years.

702
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:04,821
No, thanks.

703
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:06,589
The results of
Drew's psych eval.

704
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,290
Here's your notice.

705
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:11,197
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

706
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:16,531
Diminished capacity
caused by brutalization
at the hands of his father?

707
00:32:16,606 --> 00:32:18,198
You've got to be joking.

708
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:19,605
See if the jury Iaughs.

709
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:23,637
Well, it's an
impressive tactic.

710
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:27,911
Brutalization is part of
criminologist Lonnie Athens'
violentization theory.

711
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:30,214
Another Iame excuse
for criminal behavior?

712
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:31,344
Not necessarily.

713
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:33,889
Athens believes that
violent environment
and example

714
00:32:33,957 --> 00:32:35,618
are the cause of all
violent criminal acts.

715
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:38,024
What, no interest in genetics
or brain chemistry?

716
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:39,152
No.

717
00:32:39,228 --> 00:32:41,719
Athens interviewed a hundred
convicted violent criminals

718
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:43,595
and found that they were
all abused as children.

719
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,258
AII saw family
members brutalized

720
00:32:45,335 --> 00:32:47,132
and were all taught
to use extreme violence

721
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:49,763
in response to stressful
and threatening situations.

722
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,535
We found nothing
that even hints
Drew was abused.

723
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:53,939
How am I going
to fight this?

724
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,500
By using Drew's
own words.

725
00:32:56,312 --> 00:32:58,507
Defense claims
that Drew's
father abused him.

726
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:00,549
But in his polygraph
interview with me,

727
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,243
Drew said that his
relationship with his father

728
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:04,047
was one of mutual
indifference.

729
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,920
SCARRY: Was Drew's
childhood happy?

730
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:13,919
It was comfortable,
not happy.

731
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:15,362
Why not?

732
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:16,728
He always had to succeed.

733
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:19,826
At school,
at sports,
at everything.

734
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:21,164
And if he didn't?

735
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:23,361
He was punished.

736
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,770
By whom?

737
00:33:26,776 --> 00:33:28,869
By whom,
Mrs. Lamerly?

738
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,449
His father.
My son, Douglas.

739
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:36,683
Did his mother
not protect him?

740
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:39,847
Grace tried,
but she was
terrified of Douglas.

741
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:42,186
That's why
she turned to alcohol.

742
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:45,819
Several years ago
she checked herself
into a clinic in Bermuda

743
00:33:45,895 --> 00:33:48,022
and Drew hasn't
seen her since.

744
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:50,361
Did Douglas
ever beat Drew?

745
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:51,798
Yes.

746
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:54,598
After a flunked
test or a Iost game.

747
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,369
Douglas said failure reflected
badly on the family,
made Drew Iess of a man.

748
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:05,110
Your Honor,
I am showing the witness
Defense Exhibit Three.

749
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:09,684
Mrs. Lamerly,
do you recognize
this x-ray?

750
00:34:09,752 --> 00:34:11,845
Drew's broken arm.

751
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:14,446
He got in a fight
at a hockey game,

752
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:17,618
and when he came home,
Douglas threw him
down the stairs.

753
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,593
Because he had
been in a fight?

754
00:34:19,662 --> 00:34:22,028
Because he didn't
win the fight.

755
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:25,090
What happened
the next fight
that Drew was in?

756
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:29,832
He had to be pulled
off the other boy.
He nearly killed him.

757
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:32,898
So he had Iearned
the violent Iesson
his father had taught him?

758
00:34:32,975 --> 00:34:34,374
Yes.

759
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:35,604
Thank you.

760
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:43,311
Mrs. Lamerly, you don't seem
to have a problem exposing
your own son in court.

761
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:45,911
I am mortified.

762
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:49,253
Douglas is my only son.
I failed him.

763
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:52,453
Don't mock me for
trying to redeem
myself with my grandson.

764
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,262
You say that your son
often abused Drew,

765
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:59,733
but in his interviews
with the police,
Drew never mentioned that.

766
00:34:59,802 --> 00:35:01,099
In fact, Drew said...

767
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,606
Your Honor, the interview
to which the A.D.A. refers
was with a psychiatrist.

768
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:05,834
It's privileged.

769
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:08,638
Mr. Lamerly volunteered to do
the interview, Your Honor.

770
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:11,509
He was talking to
an FBI psychiatrist
in a police precinct.

771
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:14,175
A psychiatrist
is a psychiatrist.

772
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,718
My client had
the expectation
of privacy.

773
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:19,721
I'm sorry, Miss Cabot,
the interview is out.

774
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,992
You say that Douglas
taught Drew violence.

775
00:35:26,395 --> 00:35:27,919
Did he also
teach him to rape?

776
00:35:27,997 --> 00:35:30,090
He showed him
how to abuse women.

777
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,895
Drew's mother
will testify to that.

778
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,731
Unfortunately,
she's in Bermuda.

779
00:35:33,803 --> 00:35:35,600
So do you have
some other examples?

780
00:35:38,307 --> 00:35:40,832
He taught him to think
that women can be bought.

781
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,174
So does the advertising
industry.

782
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:46,647
The fact is that
Douglas didn't teach
Drew to rape, did he?

783
00:35:46,716 --> 00:35:48,775
Drew Iearned
that all on his own.

784
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:50,079
No.

785
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:52,916
From the age of 13,

786
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:57,659
Douglas took my grandson
to have sexual encounters
with prostitutes.

787
00:35:57,727 --> 00:35:59,991
Buy a woman,
you can do anything
you want with her.

788
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:09,194
Mrs. Lamerly assassinates
her son and turns her
grandson into the victim.

789
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:10,705
I couldn't put
a dent in her.

790
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:12,798
Jury's buying this
brutalization crap, huh?

791
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,070
Well, so far
the evidence
supports it.

792
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:17,578
Drew got into fights,
he beat up Jenny White.

793
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:19,205
Maybe his dad
did brutalize him.

794
00:36:19,282 --> 00:36:20,476
BENSON: You don't
believe that.

795
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,951
If Drew was a gang kid
with no dad and a mother
who was on crack,

796
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,113
we wouldn't blame them
for using an environment
defense.

797
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:27,713
I do blame
his environment.

798
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,782
He's a spoiled rich kid
whose family helps him get
away with rape and murder.

799
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,088
What can we do, AIex?

800
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:34,220
Well, the defense is going
to use violentization to say

801
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:36,458
that Drew was not
responsible for
his actions.

802
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:39,592
Carmen threatens him
and Drew's Iearned
response is violence.

803
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:42,035
So in a rush of rage,
he pushes her off the roof.

804
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,303
If we could prove
that there were
other cases

805
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:48,172
where Drew acted
violently without
provocation,

806
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:50,144
then we might
have a chance.

807
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:52,505
But who'II testify
against him?

808
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:59,453
Jennifer, we really
need you to testify.

809
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:00,648
No. I can't.

810
00:37:00,723 --> 00:37:03,317
You're going to Iet
Drew Lamerly get away
with rape and murder.

811
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:04,859
Very much,
will you
please just go?

812
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:06,360
I understand what
you have to Iose.

813
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,624
We've got to stop this guy,
and we can't do it
without you.

814
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:09,926
What's going on, Jen?

815
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:13,059
I can't. It's nothing.
Misunderstanding.

816
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:15,228
Who are you?
What do you want?

817
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:16,601
Police, Special Victims.

818
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,072
We were hoping we could speak
to your wife about something
that happened to her.

819
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:20,267
What?

820
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:21,537
It was before
you knew her.

821
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,010
It's not important,
Angus.

822
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:25,438
I know about
Jenny's past.

823
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,288
Well, maybe you don't
know the whole story.

824
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:35,620
She's my wife. Try me.

825
00:37:37,193 --> 00:37:38,717
Drew said he
needed a date.

826
00:37:40,062 --> 00:37:43,122
He bought me a dress,
picked me up in his car.

827
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:46,566
For a while it was
as if I really was...

828
00:37:46,636 --> 00:37:47,898
His prom date.

829
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:49,831
Yeah.

830
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,401
But Drew had been drinking.

831
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:58,174
He pulled me into a room,
started to have sex.

832
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:01,580
I went along with it.

833
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:05,951
After all,
that's how
I made my Iiving.

834
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:12,085
But suddenly he
slaps me and says,

835
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:15,756
"I'm not paying you
to enjoy it, bitch."

836
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:19,863
He ripped my dress.

837
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:22,369
He hit me
again and again.

838
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,069
And he raped me.

839
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:30,968
He treat any of the other
girls the same way?

840
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,515
A couple said
he'd hit them.

841
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:36,415
But he was easier
to handle then.

842
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:39,113
He was 13, 14.

843
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:41,816
When his father
first brought him?

844
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:44,689
No, that was the sickest
thing about Drew.

845
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,489
He came with
his grandmother.

846
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:48,427
She'd pick
his girls for him.

847
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:00,805
I told Carmen
that it was over.

848
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:04,334
She got really upset,
ran out on the balcony.

849
00:39:05,414 --> 00:39:09,612
And I tried to calm her,
but she screamed at me,
hit me.

850
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,314
And then something
inside just snapped.

851
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,584
You... You saw red?

852
00:39:15,658 --> 00:39:16,852
Yes.

853
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,057
She kept on screaming
and kicking at me

854
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:24,265
and I pushed her
against the railing

855
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:28,626
and I just pushed
her and pushed her
until she fell.

856
00:39:28,704 --> 00:39:31,696
SCARRY: Drew, did you
mean to kill her?

857
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:35,103
No, God, no.

858
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:37,736
Thank you.

859
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:48,814
Remind us again, Mr. Lamerly,
how did you break your arm?

860
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:57,555
I told you, my dad did it.

861
00:39:58,567 --> 00:39:59,795
CABOT: Really?

862
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:03,265
Because I have affidavits
from your former headmaster

863
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:04,966
and the teacher
who took you to the ER,

864
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,100
and they could swear
that you did break
your arm playing hockey.

865
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:10,771
They remember because
they were afraid your parents
were going to sue.

866
00:40:10,846 --> 00:40:12,336
Your Honor, we haven't
seen any of these.

867
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:15,873
It's the People's 23,
People's 24.

868
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:17,919
Go on, Miss Cabot.

869
00:40:17,987 --> 00:40:20,478
So tell us again, Mr. Lamerly,
how did you break your arm?

870
00:40:21,924 --> 00:40:23,084
Your father didn't do it.

871
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:25,192
He didn't touch you, did he?

872
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:29,228
Yes. Yes, he did.

873
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,831
Mr. Lamerly,
do you recognize
this woman?

874
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:39,272
No, I don't.

875
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:41,172
Her name is Jennifer White

876
00:40:41,243 --> 00:40:45,771
and I have a sworn
affidavit from her
as well, the People's 25,

877
00:40:45,848 --> 00:40:48,510
that states that you
attacked and raped her
without provocation...

878
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:49,482
Your Honor...

879
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:52,180
...which
expressly contradicts
your violentization defense.

880
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:53,414
Your Honor!

881
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:55,650
The jury will disregard
the Iast statement.

882
00:40:55,724 --> 00:40:57,419
Miss Cabot,
watch your step.

883
00:40:57,493 --> 00:40:58,858
Your Honor, I'm trying
to establish that

884
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,987
Mr. Lamerly's entire
defense is a Iie.

885
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:02,792
Then stick to
the facts in evidence.

886
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:05,095
Do not try to
introduce new material.

887
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:11,328
You testified that
your father took you
to a brothel. Is that true?

888
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:12,499
Yes.

889
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:15,567
May I remind you
that you are under oath.

890
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:17,475
I told you, it was him.

891
00:41:17,546 --> 00:41:19,275
Who took you, Mr. Lamerly?

892
00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:21,680
Stop it! Enough!
That's enough!

893
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,910
(GROANING)

894
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:25,184
SCARRY: Your Honor,
we need a doctor!

895
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:26,915
Order! Order in the court!

896
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:30,015
How could you do
such a thing, you bitch?
It's all your fault!

897
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:32,185
You're going to pay for this!
You're going to pay for this!

898
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:34,752
You can trust me on that!
Get off of me! Get off of me!

899
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,762
Get him out of here.
Settle down!

900
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:37,492
Grandma!

901
00:41:45,674 --> 00:41:47,574
Mother, it's the police.

902
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:49,110
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Lamerly?

903
00:41:49,178 --> 00:41:50,236
I'II survive.

904
00:41:50,312 --> 00:41:51,506
I hope so.

905
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,014
Long enough for you
to stand trial, anyway.

906
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,448
What are you
talking about?

907
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:58,612
Conspiracy, perjury, hindering
a prosecution. Do you want me
to go on?

908
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:00,279
You can't prove
a damn thing.

909
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:03,189
We can. Douglas told
us everything

910
00:42:04,627 --> 00:42:06,527
and now you'II be
joining Drew in prison.

911
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:09,328
What have you done?

912
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:12,431
I Iet you turn my son
into a monster.

913
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:14,093
You are nothing.

914
00:42:14,169 --> 00:42:16,603
I built this family,
I kept it strong.

915
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:19,835
You never Ioved
Drew Iike I did.
I made him a man.

916
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:21,672
I made him a man.

917
00:42:22,411 --> 00:42:23,639
You are nothing!

918
00:42:23,712 --> 00:42:26,203
You never were anything!
You're nothing!
