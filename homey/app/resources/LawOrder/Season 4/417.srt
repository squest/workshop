1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:00,064
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:03,799
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,033
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:08,009
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:11,604
are members of
an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,649
These are their stories.

7
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:19,481
Love is all
very nice, darling,
but what does he really want?

8
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:26,018
Your pecan pies
or your nice,
fat bank balance?

9
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:29,261
What on earth?

10
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:31,300
Not you, dear.

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,638
I think there's a dead
animal in my wisteria.

12
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:43,009
Now, if AIbert
is only after sex,

13
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:46,238
you have my blessing.

14
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:49,216
I mean, you're pushing 70.

15
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,214
How many more rides are Ieft
on the merry-go-round?

16
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,317
(SCREAMING)

17
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:03,832
Home owner's name
is Katerina BIundell.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,663
Victim dropped in
on her unexpectedly.

19
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:09,227
She's in her 20s.
Wearing a maid's uniform.
No ID.

20
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:11,034
Miss BIundell
have a housekeeper?

21
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:12,699
No. Lives alone.

22
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:14,675
She recognize the victim
from the neighborhood?

23
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:17,269
I doubt it.
The victim has no face.

24
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:19,405
From the Iividity,
she's been dead a while.

25
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:20,744
Why'd you call us?

26
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:23,342
WARNER: Looks Iike a suicide,
but somebody worked
her over pretty good.

27
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:25,887
There's bruising
on her breasts,
buttocks, thighs.

28
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:27,149
Maybe a rape
and toss?

29
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:28,383
Some of these
are old.

30
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,255
This stuff didn't
just happen once.

31
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:31,554
BENSON: Looks Iike
she fell from there.

32
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,652
STABLER: Trellacker Tower.
Millionaire heaven.

33
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:36,357
So she Iands head first,
breaks the glass,

34
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:38,366
falls onto the plants
which hold her for a while

35
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:41,130
until Katerina
goes poking around.

36
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:43,195
She's a maid.
Probably doesn't
speak much English.

37
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:45,331
AIone in a foreign country.
If she was raped,

38
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:47,501
it's not surprising
she didn't call the cops.

39
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:50,011
So she takes the high dive.

40
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,740
Or she was pushed.

41
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,294
STABLER: Mr. Paysen?
Yeah.

42
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:48,667
SVU. Detective Stabler.
My partner, Detective Benson.

43
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:51,571
Now, the doorman says
that you run security
for the Lamerly family.

44
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:53,233
Yeah. SVU?
What's this about?

45
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:56,642
We've got a jumper.
Looks Iike she fell
from the penthouse.

46
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:57,940
Did you check all
the other apartments?

47
00:02:58,014 --> 00:03:01,211
Well, the doorman says that
the windows don't open wide
enough to Iet a child out.

48
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:03,149
Well, why is sex crimes
interested in a suicide?

49
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,517
We believe that
she was assaulted
before she fell.

50
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:07,055
You did some
time on the job?

51
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:09,591
Put in my 20 at the 29.
When'd this happen?

52
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,149
Sometime over
the weekend.

53
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,195
No one's been in
the penthouse from
Friday morning

54
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:14,854
till Sunday night when
Mrs. Lamerly came home.

55
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:15,955
From where?
Connecticut.

56
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:17,624
The rest of the family's
still up there.

57
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,498
I drove Mrs. L. back early
to take in a concert.

58
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,538
There's no sign
of a break-in.

59
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:25,233
Even so, we'd Iike
to take a Iook around.

60
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:28,243
Like I said, nobody's been
here since Friday morning.

61
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:31,974
Well, we could come back
with a warrant and a couple
of TV crews if you'd Iike.

62
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:35,183
Just Iet me
warn the old Iady.

63
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:37,180
Thank you.

64
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,425
You think she fell
from our balcony?

65
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:44,982
BENSON: It seems Iikely.

66
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:47,529
Oh, the poor soul.
Do you know who she is?

67
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:51,727
We're working on that.
She was wearing
a housekeeper's uniform.

68
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:53,098
Gray dress,
white apron.

69
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,967
But all our help
had the weekend off.

70
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:58,370
STABLER: We'II need
names and addresses.

71
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:01,636
Of course.
Tom will get
them for you.

72
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:08,182
BENSON: There's our
crime scene.

73
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:10,310
There's no sign of
a struggle here or inside.

74
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:12,411
I still don't
understand how she
could've got out here.

75
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:15,286
We're going to need to take
a Iook at the building
security camera tapes.

76
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:16,552
Ma'am, please don't
touch the railing.

77
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:19,356
I'm sorry. Is this
where she fell?

78
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:20,452
Looks Iike it.

79
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,054
We're going to have to have
a Crime Scene Unit come up
here and check things out.

80
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,463
Of course.

81
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:29,070
Lamerly money comes
from Iate Grandpa's
real estate business.

82
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,765
He had the cash,
Grandma had the class.

83
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,467
Son Douglas runs
everything now.

84
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,532
Wife Iives in Bermuda
and rarely comes ashore.

85
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,599
Kids?

86
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:38,044
Yeah, one son, Drew,
just back from Europe.

87
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:39,308
And what about Granny?

88
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:42,874
She hosts tea parties
and presides over
a dozen charitable events.

89
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,544
Their story hold up?

90
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,248
Doorman said that
the penthouse had
no visitors over the weekend,

91
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:49,723
but he can't see who comes
in through the garage.

92
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,056
FIN: This is off
the penthouse Iobby camera.

93
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,096
4:45 p.m. Saturday.

94
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:57,892
She's got her own key.
Any pictures of her face?

95
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:01,095
Now, that would be too easy.
And that's it.

96
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,762
She's the only one who
went into the penthouse

97
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,170
till Gran and the chauffeur
come home Sunday evening.

98
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:06,936
Any reports of
missing servants?

99
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,239
AII present and
accounted for.

100
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:11,609
So who is this woman?

101
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:18,080
I'm running prints,
dental, DNA.

102
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:21,146
There's too much bone damage
to try facial reconstruction.

103
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:23,123
Tested her for
drugs and alcohol.
She's clean.

104
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,454
Did you get anything
from the rape kit?

105
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:25,687
No fluids.

106
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:29,288
But traces of
Iubricant and spermicide.
Her attacker used a condom.

107
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:31,595
Can you connect the assault
to the time of death?

108
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:35,899
Most of the bruises
and strap marks are old,
but there are petechiae here.

109
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:38,439
Broken capillaries
that didn't have
time to form bruises.

110
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:40,975
So she was raped, beaten,
and went up to
the penthouse to die?

111
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,807
Or she Iikes rough sex.
None of this proves
she was raped.

112
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,109
Hands around
the throat could be
erotic asphyxiation.

113
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:49,151
The strap marks could be
the badge of an S&M junkie.

114
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:51,914
Possible. The degree
of violence is pretty
controlled.

115
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:54,615
Another thing,
CSU only found one shoe.

116
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,282
They're still Iooking
for the second one.

117
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:58,953
Pretty high-end for a maid.

118
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:03,156
Nice stockings, too.

119
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:06,668
Okay, she's wearing
high heels, fancy underwear,
dresses Iike a maid,

120
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:09,296
and Iets herself into
a rich man's apartment?

121
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,704
Sounds Iike an out-call
fantasy to me.

122
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:14,139
My God.

123
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:17,640
I think it's Anna.

124
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,080
I can't believe
she'd do this.

125
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,140
Who's Anna,
Mr. Lamerly?

126
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:24,710
Anna Rivera.

127
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,448
She worked
a month for us,

128
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:29,286
and then we Iearned
that she Iied about
her Iegal status.

129
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:30,916
Last week we
had to Iet her go.

130
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:33,427
Do you always check
the immigration
status of your staff?

131
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,929
We Iead public Iives,
Detective.

132
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:36,624
We have to be able
to withstand scrutiny.

133
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,894
Do you have any idea
why Anna would kill herself?

134
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,464
She was very upset
about Iosing the job.

135
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,699
She begged us
not to fire her.

136
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:47,265
But I honestly never
thought she'd do this.

137
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:50,312
The severance
was very generous.
Three months' salary.

138
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,677
That'II put a dent
in the bank account.

139
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:55,876
Did Anna usually wear
shoes Iike this to work?

140
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,475
I have no idea.

141
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,384
I don't inspect
the staff's shoes.

142
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:02,618
She was wearing
stiletto heels
and expensive underwear.

143
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,091
I don't think she came up
to polish the credenza.

144
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:06,458
What are you trying
to say, Detective?

145
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,589
Whoever abused Anna
made a habit of it.

146
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,392
Her body showed signs
of repeated, violent sex.

147
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:13,992
Well, what has that
got to do with me?

148
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,334
Anna came to this
apartment to die,
Mr. Lamerly.

149
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:18,668
Why do you think
she did that?

150
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:21,141
You can't honestly
think I have anything
to do with this.

151
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,939
How well did
your son know her?

152
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:24,673
Where was he
Saturday night?

153
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:27,375
In Connecticut.
We all were.

154
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,114
You barge in here,
no warrant, no nothing,
making wild accusations...

155
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:34,383
Douglas, please.
Don't shout.

156
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:37,725
Police have to
do their job.

157
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:40,318
BENSON: Do you know
where Anna used to Iive?

158
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:42,728
My son will get
you the address.

159
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,993
LAYTON: Detectives?

160
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:47,825
Something you should see.

161
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:50,429
BENSON: Prints.

162
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:51,871
Took the same prints
on the balcony door.

163
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:53,875
Was she alone?
Far as I can tell.

164
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,808
There's only the one set.
What about inside?

165
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:59,177
Nothing. PIace is immaculate.
But, hey, Granny Iooks
Iike a clean freak.

166
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:02,615
So our victim gets attacked
someplace else but comes here
to kill herself?

167
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:05,677
She came straight out here,
she climbs over the edge,

168
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:07,016
she holds onto the railing.

169
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:09,080
Smearing suggests
she didn't Iet go
right away.

170
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:11,251
She changed her mind.
She tried to pull herself up.

171
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,521
STABLER: Wasn't strong enough.

172
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:13,857
Anna's address.

173
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,600
BENSON: Mr. Karenn,
when was the Iast
time you saw Anna?

174
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,967
When she paid her rent.
Tuesday.

175
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:24,630
Did she pay you
for the whole month?

176
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:26,800
Wouldn't be
Iiving here
otherwise.

177
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,338
She ever bring
boyfriends here?

178
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,379
No. Is she in trouble?

179
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:33,573
That's what we're
trying to find out.

180
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,207
This her?

181
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:36,877
Yeah.

182
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:39,045
You got any
numbers or addresses
for her family?

183
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:42,022
Said she was from
Guatemala. Try there.

184
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:43,456
Can't find a note.

185
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:46,451
What was Anna Iike,
Mr. Karenn?

186
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,363
Quiet, clean.
She paid her rent.
Perfect.

187
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:55,168
Then I guess
you'd be real upset
to find out she's dead.

188
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:56,534
Oh, jeez.

189
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,997
What am I going to
do with her stuff?

190
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:01,008
Why don't you
send it to Guatemala?

191
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:04,307
We'II take these for the M.E.
so she can make a positive ID.

192
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,440
Can't get anything
off of these for DNA.
They're brand new.

193
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:10,883
Oh, well, that figures.
AII right, I'II have CSU
comb the place.

194
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,318
Take a Iook
at this first.

195
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,584
Lots of fine cuts,
some healed, some new.

196
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,957
BENSON: From cleaning
a penthouse?

197
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:20,086
I swabbed her hands.

198
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,357
Didn't find any
household cleaners
that a maid would use.

199
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,661
Only an acetone
called Rexton,

200
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:27,293
exclusively used
in cleaning
motion picture film.

201
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:30,066
Early 20s,
handles Iots of film.

202
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,606
Could be a
film student.

203
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:34,274
The Lamerlys were
definitely in Connecticut.

204
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:36,607
Had some Iocal muckety-mucks
over for dinner.

205
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,978
Son Drew even got his picture
taken up there running a red
Iight in his Iittle Audi.

206
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,516
6:10 p.m.

207
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:42,983
Anything on
the film schools?

208
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:44,417
Thanks.

209
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:46,886
Any idea how many
film schools there
are in New York?

210
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:49,356
PIus a student failing
to show up for class
on Monday morning

211
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,689
is not exactly going
to set off alarms.

212
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,421
Any chance Anna
was taking classes?

213
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:56,430
Well, not unless she
went by the name of
Carmen Trancoso.

214
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:59,797
Carmen was supposed
to screen her first-year
film at the New School.

215
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:03,429
She didn't show. The girl she
made it with said she hasn't
seen her since Saturday.

216
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:10,835
Suzie, you knew her
well. Has Carmen been
upset Iately?

217
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,972
Why? Tell me
what's going on.

218
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:14,310
We're worried
about her.

219
00:10:14,383 --> 00:10:16,112
Does she Ieave her
personal stuff here?

220
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,846
This is hers.

221
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:21,419
And this stuff.

222
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:24,148
Yeah? Where's Carmen from?

223
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:26,194
Sao Paulo, Brazil.

224
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,661
Well, she have a hard
time adjusting here?

225
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:33,634
She does okay
considering her
English isn't too good.

226
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:35,260
Is this Carmen?

227
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,702
She's a beautiful girl.

228
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:39,866
Does she have
a boyfriend?

229
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:43,844
Used to. They broke up.
Carmen was pretty upset.

230
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,277
BENSON: She talk
to you about it?

231
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:46,405
Not really.

232
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:48,382
Well, what'd
she say about it?

233
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,315
That she was going
to make him pay.

234
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:55,852
Well, do you think Carmen
was upset enough to try
to hurt herself?

235
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:58,688
What do you mean?
Is that what's happened?

236
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,059
We don't know,
but we have to Iook at
all the possibilities.

237
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,995
What's her
boyfriend's name?

238
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:04,862
Drew. Drew Lamerly.

239
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:08,464
M.E. confirms.

240
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:11,199
The DNA off
the Iipstick proves
that the dead girl

241
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:13,798
is Drew Lamerly's ex,
Carmen Trancoso.

242
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:17,277
So he dumps her, she goes
to his apartment for an
attention-seeking suicide?

243
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:19,041
Dresses as the maid
to get by the doorman.

244
00:11:19,114 --> 00:11:21,844
She uses a key that
either Drew gave her
or she stole it.

245
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,044
What about Anna Rivera?
Vanished.

246
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,553
Customs has no record
of her on any flights
out of New York.

247
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:29,591
And if she's going to go home,
why not take all of her stuff
with her?

248
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:31,853
Look who's here.
Poster boy.

249
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,152
Hi. Can we help you?

250
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:36,896
My name is Drew Lamerly.

251
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,327
Suzie called me.

252
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:40,891
I think I should
make a statement.

253
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,204
About what?

254
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:44,534
Carmen Trancoso.

255
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,468
It's my fault
she's dead.

256
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,875
Carmen and I went
out for about a month.

257
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,179
It was intense.

258
00:11:57,252 --> 00:12:00,221
So intense it scared me.
I broke up with her.

259
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:01,620
When'd you break up?

260
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,284
About ten days ago.
She took it bad.

261
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:06,259
She kept coming
to the apartment,
following me around.

262
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,023
When was the Iast time
you talked to her, Drew?

263
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:10,759
Saturday. She called me,
begged me to see her.

264
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,825
I said I was with
my family in the country.
She became hysterical.

265
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:16,234
Said she'd make me sorry
if I didn't come over.

266
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:18,364
So I told her to get
a Iife and I hung up.

267
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:23,705
If I'd just gone there,
been kind to her,
she might still be alive.

268
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,945
What time did
she call you?

269
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:28,578
Around 5:30, I think.

270
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,550
So Anna Rivera
isn't dead then.

271
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,484
No, she's not.

272
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:35,523
One of the other
maids just heard from her.
Turns out she's in Miami.

273
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,889
Why'd she run and Ieave
everything behind?

274
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,488
Well, she didn't.
Her aunt was really sick
and she had to go see her.

275
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:45,055
Aunt is sick.

276
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,358
I'm missing something here.

277
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:50,735
Drew, why did your dad say
the dead girl was Anna?

278
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,673
He got all teary-eyed
and everything.

279
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,709
Well, the girl in the tape
Iooks just Iike Anna.

280
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,142
She's wearing
a maid's uniform.

281
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,906
Well, so was Carmen.

282
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:02,015
Why is that?

283
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:04,484
She knew she couldn't
get into the building
any other way.

284
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:06,487
I'd told the doorman
not to Iet her in.

285
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,053
Carmen got by him dressed
as a maid. She get a copy
of your key?

286
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:14,323
Yes, which she must have
taken from me while I was
sleeping and duped it.

287
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,387
You guys spent
the night together
a Iot, right?

288
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:19,229
Well, I told you,
it was a very
intense relationship.

289
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:23,534
You call beating
the crap out of
her intense, huh?

290
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:26,073
You Iittle prick,
you did this to her.

291
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:28,575
Yes, I did do this,
but she wanted me to.

292
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:30,339
No. No woman wants this.

293
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:32,505
Carmen did!
This was her thing.

294
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,776
So you beat and rape her
because it was her thing?

295
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,182
I never raped her.
She Iiked it.

296
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:39,982
It was never enough, though.
She wanted more.

297
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:41,920
She wanted more of what?

298
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,458
She... She wanted me to...

299
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:46,517
She wanted me to choke her
until she blacked out.

300
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:48,426
But I couldn't do that.
I couldn't.

301
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:50,260
That's when I knew
it was too much.

302
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:52,766
I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry, okay?

303
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:54,492
(SIGHS)

304
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,901
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,131
Drew's story checked out.

306
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,733
We got a 10-minute call
from the penthouse
to Connecticut.

307
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,334
5:32 p.m. Saturday.

308
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:04,470
What about the bruising?

309
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,845
M.E. said the violence
was controlled. So it
could have been consensual.

310
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,383
What's your take
on this kid?

311
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:11,385
He's got answers
for everything.

312
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:14,388
Fin, you and Munch see
if Drew's got history.
But do it quietly.

313
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:17,323
I don't want the Lamerlys
complaining to the brass
that we're harassing them.

314
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:20,122
You know,
this is Carmen's
date book.

315
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:23,221
She met with
this Roger Burnbaum
three times Iast week.

316
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:24,526
There's a number here.

317
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,965
Another boyfriend?

318
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:27,728
Maybe it was Drew
who didn't end it.

319
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:30,294
Maybe Carmen dumped him
for this Roger Burnbaum.

320
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:31,737
Guess who I'm holding for.

321
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:35,368
Roger Burnbaum and DeLisle,
personal injury Iawyers.

322
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,775
She was suing someone.

323
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:42,140
We represent Carmen Trancoso,
but I can't say why
without her permission.

324
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,048
She can't give it.
She's dead.

325
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,518
What happened?

326
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:46,918
She committed suicide.

327
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,581
So I hope
you're paid up.

328
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,852
We take cases on
a contingency basis.

329
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:52,359
No win, no fee.

330
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:54,486
That's noble of you.
What was Carmen
hoping to win?

331
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:58,260
A substantial settlement
from her ex-boyfriend
for rape.

332
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,701
Her ex-boyfriend
being Drew Lamerly.

333
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:04,532
How do you know?
She said she
hadn't told anybody.

334
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,367
Carmen died by
throwing herself 20 floors
from the Lamerly penthouse.

335
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:11,139
STABLER: She have
a good case against him?

336
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:13,113
To be honest, no.

337
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:17,344
She told me her sex Iife
with Mr. Lamerly had gotten
increasingly violent.

338
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,319
She tried to break up,
he pursued her.

339
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:21,356
When she resisted,
he raped and beat her.

340
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,118
And how is that
not a good case?

341
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:25,352
She refused to report
the rape to the police.

342
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:27,725
Afraid it might
affect her student visa.

343
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:28,854
BENSON: Did you believe her?

344
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:30,956
I believe
he hurt her very badly,

345
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,001
but I wasn't
sure he raped her.

346
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:34,467
But you took the case anyway.

347
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:37,027
Yes. I thought they'd settle.

348
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:40,268
If you were the Lamerlys,
would you want this
sort of publicity?

349
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:46,537
LAMERLY: Detectives,
our attorney, Lorna Scarry.

350
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:48,845
Funny, we just came from
Carmen Trancoso's attorney.

351
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,317
How is Mr. DeLisle?
Hit by any ambulances Iately?

352
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:53,650
He's sad that he won't
be trying his case.

353
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:55,314
Oh, pity.

354
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:55,553
Just when he thought
the gravy train had
stopped at his station.

355
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,686
You see a raped woman
as a gravy train?

356
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,320
I swear to you
I never raped her.

357
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,523
Drew.

358
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:03,294
Believe me, officers,
I am sorry for the girl's
death,

359
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,063
but she was unbalanced.

360
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:07,195
She tried emotional blackmail,
she tried the Iaw,

361
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:11,572
and when she realized that
we weren't going to cave in to
her outrageous claims,

362
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:12,769
she killed herself.

363
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:16,678
Well, the marks on
Carmen's body support
those outrageous claims.

364
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:18,306
I told you,
that's what she wanted.

365
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:21,614
Well, that's easy to say,
given she's not here
to defend herself.

366
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:22,983
Can you prove it?

367
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:25,454
It's not our job to prove.
But we can.

368
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:28,826
Affidavits from
three of Carmen's
former boyfriends,

369
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,758
two of whom
she picked up in bars.

370
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,854
They testified that
she was an animal.

371
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:35,058
The rougher the sex,
the better.

372
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:40,194
So our victim is now a
gold-digging whore and we are
totally being jerked around.

373
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:42,000
Every time we come
up with something,

374
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:45,167
the Lamerlys are ready
and waiting with some
plausible explanation.

375
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:46,232
What've you got?

376
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,903
Facts and figures
on Drew Lamerly.

377
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:51,312
Your typical red-blooded,
all-American boy with an
eight-figure trust fund.

378
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:55,581
Wrapped a few sports cars
around Iampposts,
a few parking tickets,

379
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,780
but no record,
no ex-girlfriends
crying rape.

380
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,585
He's popular.
PIayed hockey and tennis.

381
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:01,124
Good enough for any
college varsity team.

382
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:04,093
Except he didn't graduate
high school. He spent three
years at college in Paris.

383
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:06,630
Well, you know what I think?
I think we've got nothing
we can prove

384
00:17:06,698 --> 00:17:10,998
and too many cases with real,
Iive victims to waste time
chasing shadows.

385
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,165
Now, see if there's a reason
Drew didn't graduate.
If there isn't, case closed.

386
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:19,471
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

387
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:23,503
I'm afraid the Radleigh School
didn't quite meet
Drew Lamerly's needs.

388
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:24,775
Can you translate
that for me?

389
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,283
We expelled him. Pity.
He was a good student.

390
00:17:27,352 --> 00:17:28,512
What did he do?

391
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,247
Disrupted our senior prom.

392
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:33,757
He brought a very attractive
older woman as his date.

393
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:37,124
I suspect it was to show off,
but she seemed out of her
element.

394
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:38,662
Kind of girl you
don't bring home
to Mom and Dad.

395
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,788
Precisely.

396
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:42,094
Well, it still doesn't
explain why you kicked
him out.

397
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:47,697
To cut a sordid story short,
they both got drunk,
there was an altercation.

398
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:50,866
The woman called the police
and accused Drew
of assaulting her.

399
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:53,739
Did he?

400
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:55,712
The police didn't
seem to think so.

401
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,476
And neither,
in the cold Iight of day,
did the young woman.

402
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,643
She dropped the charges.

403
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:04,245
However, school policy
is very clear on
these matters.

404
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:06,620
No alcohol.
He had to go.

405
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:08,318
Do you remember
the young woman's name?

406
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,952
It was five years ago.

407
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:15,621
Radleigh High prom
gives us a date,
May 16th, '97.

408
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,930
We're at the 29 now. Yeah.

409
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:20,163
AII right,
we'II be in touch,
Captain.

410
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:21,730
Anything?

411
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:22,966
There's no 61.

412
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:24,933
You mean no one
filed a complaint?

413
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:28,274
Oh, they filed a complaint,
but the 61's disappeared.

414
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,871
Looks Iike the Lamerlys
are sweeping up after
Drew again.

415
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,474
This time they
missed some dirt.

416
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:36,145
One of the cops
filled out an "Aided" card.

417
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:38,348
They're not kept
in the same place
as the 61s.

418
00:18:38,423 --> 00:18:41,483
Nope. Card gives the
assault victim's name
as a Miss Jenny White, 24.

419
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,687
She refused medical
assistance, but she
did give us an address.

420
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,100
I'm Camilla Hartnell.
Can I help you?

421
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:53,501
Yeah. Detective Benson,
this is Detective Stabler,
SVU.

422
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:56,563
We'd Iike to speak
to a Miss Jenny White.

423
00:18:56,641 --> 00:19:00,133
Jenny gave this address
in a complaint that
she made to the police.

424
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,303
When?

425
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:04,473
About five years ago.
She was assaulted
at a high school prom.

426
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:05,880
It's taken you
this Iong to respond?

427
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,417
Well, we have some
new information.

428
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:11,114
I'm sorry, I... I've Iived
here for 20 years and I don't
know a Jenny White.

429
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:12,281
You know him?

430
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:13,415
No.

431
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:17,895
Oh, Frank, hi!
See you tonight
at around 6:00. Bye.

432
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:20,453
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

433
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:21,897
No. Thank you so much.

434
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,228
BENSON: It's a dead end.
Maybe.

435
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:25,098
I think we need
to talk to the cops
who took the statement.

436
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,364
STABLER: Wait, check this out.

437
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:28,735
Want to go get
a cup of coffee?
Come on, come on.

438
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:30,205
Yeah, okay.

439
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:34,873
I think one of
Mrs. Hartnell's girls just
decided not to come home.

440
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:36,208
PIace is a brothel.

441
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:38,504
(KNOCKING)

442
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:43,948
Oh, you're still here.

443
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:47,480
Yeah, and we're going to stay
here until you start telling
us the truth.

444
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,651
I have told
you the truth.

445
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:51,217
Then your memory's
not serving you correctly.

446
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,593
Jenny White works for you,

447
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:53,892
and if you don't
tell us where she is,

448
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,660
we're going to have
Vice tear this place apart.

449
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,360
Do you really think
I'm afraid of Vice?

450
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:58,834
AII I need to do is
make one phone call...

451
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:00,495
Great. Why don't you go
ahead and do that then?

452
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:02,164
Excuse me,
but where do you
think you're going?

453
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,401
AII right, Iisten up.
NYPD. This is a raid.

454
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:05,737
Everyone up
against this wall.

455
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,902
BENSON: Let's go.
You, all of you out of here.

456
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:08,002
Stand right there.
Come on.

457
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,947
PIease, don't do this. Don't.
I'II tell you, I'II tell you.

458
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,209
Jenny White stopped working
here three years ago.

459
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:16,583
BENSON: Where is she?

460
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:19,851
Married to Angus Rochester,
one of the richest men
in Manhattan.

461
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:23,451
And I think you'II find
she's similarly disinclined
to remember the past.

462
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,887
Excuse me,
Jennifer White?

463
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,566
I'm sorry,
my name's Rochester.

464
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,102
Prom night,
Radleigh High School.
Remember?

465
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,297
I don't know what
you're talking about.

466
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:39,571
Sure you do. We spoke
to your former employer,
Mrs. Hartnell.

467
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,202
Drew Lamerly ring a bell?

468
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:45,047
We believe he raped
another young woman
who recently killed herself.

469
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:47,743
ANGUS: Jen!

470
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:51,484
Lady, we don't care
who you were or who you are.

471
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:53,786
Just yes or no,
did Drew Lamerly
rape you?

472
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:56,359
Yes, he raped me.

473
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:59,760
But if you ask me anything
in front of my husband,
I will deny it.

474
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:03,095
Oh, who's that?

475
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,067
ANGUS: Hi, hon.
Hi, sweetie.

476
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:07,161
Stabler. Yeah.

477
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,005
So now Drew gets
away with it again.

478
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:14,669
Maybe Drew's
Iuck just ran out.

479
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:20,115
Something was bugging me
about Carmen's suicide,
the arc of the fall.

480
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:22,118
So I had the boys
set up a simulation.

481
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:24,051
Digital model of
Trellacker Tower.

482
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:26,590
The M.E. gave us
Carmen's weight,
factored in building height,

483
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:29,650
wind speed,
body's acceleration.

484
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:33,163
If Carmen just Iet go of
the railing or simply stepped
off it, this is what happens.

485
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:40,931
BENSON: She falls into
the yard next door.

486
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:43,633
Five yards short
of where she actually
Ianded.

487
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,235
But if she's given some
Iateral propulsion from
the railing, we get this.

488
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:55,545
Lateral propulsion.
She was pushed.

489
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,985
That's right.

490
00:21:57,055 --> 00:22:02,015
Wait, but the prints show
that she was over the railing
clinging onto the edge.

491
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:04,357
Yeah, but if she's pushed
back against the railing,

492
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:07,489
she'd be gripping it
in exactly the same way.

493
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:09,795
So he pushes her
further and further,

494
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:12,802
she fights, she kicks him,
the shoe comes off,

495
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,170
but his body weight is
against her, she can't
hold anymore, she goes over.

496
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:20,005
Not suicide, murder.

497
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:26,183
So somebody pushed
Carmen off the roof.

498
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,480
For all the evidence
you've got, it might
as well be a ghost.

499
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,384
That ghost is
Drew Lamerly.

500
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:33,686
Wouldn't be the first rich kid
who thinks he's entitled
to treat women how he wants.

501
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:36,283
You only have
the two rape cases,
Jenny White and Carmen?

502
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:38,056
Well, one can't talk
and the other one won't.

503
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,687
We've been Iooking.
Can't find anyone else.

504
00:22:39,764 --> 00:22:43,131
But who knows how many others
were bought off or intimidated
into silence?

505
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,463
Okay, what's your
next move?

506
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:46,833
Well, Fin's checking
on why the cops buried

507
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:48,929
Jenny White's 61
from five years ago.

508
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:52,203
CSU just found the other shoe
stuck in a tree
nearly half a block away.

509
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:54,107
They're running tests.

510
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:56,043
It's Drew, Captain,
and I'm going to put
him on that balcony.

511
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:58,309
Well, your first
problem is

512
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:03,252
to explain how he is running
a red Iight in Connecticut
at the time of Carmen's death.

513
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:06,688
What if he's not Drew?
Baseball cap is
covering half his face.

514
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,818
Well, it doesn't help us
if it's not a positive ID.

515
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:12,590
Isn't there some work
you could be doing, John?

516
00:23:12,663 --> 00:23:13,823
I am working.

517
00:23:13,898 --> 00:23:17,265
The techs checked the security
tape after Carmen entered
the penthouse.

518
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:19,360
Came up with zip.
I've been Iooking at
it before she arrived.

519
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:20,563
I think I got something.

520
00:23:20,638 --> 00:23:22,538
Look at the second
hand on the clock.

521
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:24,837
It stops and then
it jumps forward.

522
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,638
BENSON: Ten seconds
are missing.

523
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:28,442
Somebody cut it
out of that tape.

524
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:30,845
The doorman said
that a repairman
from tower security

525
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:33,509
came by Sunday morning
to do a maintenance check.

526
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,643
So at 4:15,
half an hour
before Carmen arrived,

527
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,153
we've got someone
entering that penthouse.

528
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:38,449
He was waiting for her.

529
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:43,253
That call from the penthouse
to Connecticut at 5:30 wasn't
from Carmen,

530
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:45,955
it was from Drew,
calling home
to say what happened.

531
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,830
Dad jumps into Drew's car,
runs a red Iight,
it's an instant alibi.

532
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:53,393
So Drew kills Carmen
but Ieaves no trace of
himself on her or the balcony

533
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:56,804
and he's clever enough to make
sure that Carmen's prints
are Ieft on the railing?

534
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:58,307
This kid had to have help.

535
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:02,608
He did.
Guess which cop interviewed
Jenny White five years ago?

536
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,274
Tom Paysen,
the Lamerlys' Mr. Fix-it.

537
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:10,712
PIot's starting to unravel,
Tom. We know about Jenny,
the camera...

538
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:11,812
I don't follow you.

539
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:14,722
Drew calls Carmen,
tells her to come
over to his penthouse.

540
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,157
"Let's try to
work things out."

541
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:18,991
Then he tells her to dress
as a maid so the doorman
doesn't recognize her.

542
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:22,555
Yeah, and Carmen comes over,
she still Ioves Drew,
but they fight.

543
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,965
So he rapes her
and pushes her
off the balcony.

544
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:26,731
That's when
the cover-ups begin.

545
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:30,472
Word from the Iocal precinct
is the jumper has no face.

546
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:34,877
Cover up number one,
girl's in a maid's uniform,
why not call her Anna Rivera?

547
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:39,576
FIN: Anna gets moved out,
place gets cleaned so the DNA
doesn't mess up the story.

548
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,413
But the dumb old cops
figure out
it's Carmen anyway.

549
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:42,976
Cover up number two,

550
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:47,252
Carmen's a nut and a whore
who offs herself because
she Ioses her rich boyfriend.

551
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:48,656
But who could have
fixed all this?

552
00:24:48,726 --> 00:24:52,321
Somebody who knows
how the police think,
how they work.

553
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:54,089
You.

554
00:24:57,168 --> 00:25:00,831
I got to hand it
to you guys. SVU.

555
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:03,840
I thought you were
just the panty police,
but you're right up there.

556
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:05,000
Up where?

557
00:25:05,076 --> 00:25:09,172
Dreamland.
Carmen was a mixed-up kid
who committed suicide.

558
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:11,215
Look at the evidence,
you dumb bastards.

559
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:14,718
Evidence you manufactured.
You cut 10 seconds
off that security tape.

560
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:16,582
How many more cover-ups
you think this clown's got?

561
00:25:16,654 --> 00:25:17,678
I don't have to
Iisten to this.

562
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:19,848
You've been off
the job so Iong
you forgot the Iaw.

563
00:25:19,924 --> 00:25:20,982
Yeah, what Iaw?

564
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:25,051
The ones you broke, hindering
a police investigation,
tampering with evidence.

565
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:26,994
Make yourself at home.

566
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,364
I'm sorry
to have kept you
waiting, Detectives.

567
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,133
I was getting changed.

568
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:41,304
My son isn't back from
the city yet and I'm afraid
I have to go out.

569
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:42,778
Yet another
charity dinner.

570
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:44,815
Mrs. Lamerly, we need
to speak with your grandson.

571
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:47,407
But that's not possible,
Drew's my escort tonight.

572
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:49,077
Detectives, what is it?

573
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:51,053
We know that you were
in the penthouse with Carmen.

574
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:52,384
So what'd you do
to her up there?

575
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:53,923
What are you
talking about?

576
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,688
He was with us that night.
Tell them, Drew.

577
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,161
Look, can we do
this somewhere else?
My grandmother's not well.

578
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,720
Drew, we know
about the cover-up.

579
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:02,699
Are you saying
Drew hurt that girl?
That's not possible.

580
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:04,133
He couldn't do
such a thing.

581
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:06,193
Oh, yeah?
Jenny White.

582
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:09,200
That name mean
anything to you?

583
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,766
(SIGHS)

584
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:14,878
I knew this would
come out eventually.

585
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:17,245
I told you,
I told your father.
He wouldn't Iisten.

586
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:19,145
You told him what?

587
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:23,177
That Drew should
take his punishment
for hurting Jenny.

588
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:24,884
So you admit
that he did it?

589
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:29,489
Well, why didn't you speak up
then instead of shipping him
off to Paris?

590
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:32,496
One's instinct is to protect
one's children, Detective.

591
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:34,690
But I insisted
Drew get help.

592
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:37,030
Six months in
a psychiatric hospital.

593
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:39,297
He was a child then.
He's grown up now.

594
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:40,599
And become a murderer.

595
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:45,032
Drew didn't do
anything to Carmen.

596
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,841
Test him.

597
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,278
You have Iie detectors,
don't you? Test him.

598
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:51,179
If he didn't kill Carmen,
who did?

599
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,283
Tom Paysen,
our security man.

600
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:58,380
He was obsessed with Carmen.
He wasn't here on Saturday
night.

601
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,324
How can I make
you believe me?

602
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:06,020
Take the polygraph test.

603
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,129
HUANG: How would you
describe your childhood?
Was it happy or unhappy?

604
00:27:13,438 --> 00:27:14,962
Pretty happy.

605
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:17,569
Did you get along
with your parents?

606
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:21,475
It's...
Am I being tested yet?

607
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,641
This is
the pre-test interview.

608
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:27,080
I asked you about
your relationship
with your parents.

609
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:33,185
Well, I mean,
it's okay, I guess.

610
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,521
My mom is not well.
Hasn't been for a while.

611
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:40,597
Dad's working
all the time.

612
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:42,759
So I guess you could say
we're mutually indifferent.

613
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:45,227
MAN: We're set.

614
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:46,634
I'm going to
show you some cards

615
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,332
and I'm going
to try to guess
what each one of them is.

616
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:51,838
You must answer no
even if I guess correctly.

617
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:55,944
Is it the four of hearts?

618
00:27:56,014 --> 00:27:57,106
No.

619
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,910
Is it the king of spades?

620
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:03,181
No.

621
00:28:05,757 --> 00:28:07,224
Is it the eight of diamonds?

622
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:09,785
No.

623
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:12,053
It is the eight, isn't it?

624
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:19,732
HUANG: The graph clearly
registers the Iie.

625
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,565
No way out then, huh?

626
00:28:26,545 --> 00:28:27,705
Are you ready?

627
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:31,375
Is your name Drew Lamerly?

628
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,542
Yes.

629
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:34,414
Have you ever
stolen from a friend?

630
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:36,914
No.

631
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:39,550
Have you ever forced a woman
to have sex with you?

632
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:44,287
Yes.

633
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,199
Was that woman
Jenny White?

634
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:52,603
Yes.

635
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,439
Did you force Carmen Trancoso
to have sex with you?

636
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:00,435
No.

637
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:06,640
Did you murder
Carmen Trancoso?

638
00:29:09,855 --> 00:29:10,913
No.

639
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:19,863
The polygraph says
he's being truthful.

640
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:22,094
But I think he's Iying.

641
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,566
What, he's using
countermeasures?

642
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:25,865
Yeah, Iike a pebble
in the shoe,
breathing control.

643
00:29:25,937 --> 00:29:28,405
Anything to manipulate
his body's
physiological response.

644
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:29,838
Well, how do you know
that from the test?

645
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:31,239
I ran a Control
Questions Test

646
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:33,402
which means that I included
non-relevant questions

647
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:35,537
which could still
provoke a guilty response.

648
00:29:35,614 --> 00:29:36,876
Like, "Have you ever
stolen from a friend?"

649
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:38,006
HUANG: Right.

650
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:39,880
Drew was taught
how to spot
the control questions

651
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:42,476
and how to adjust
his body's response
accordingly.

652
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:47,386
The polygraph shows a guilty
response for, "Have you ever
stolen from a friend?"

653
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:53,196
But almost no response
for the relevant question,

654
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:55,256
"Did you murder
Carmen Trancoso?"

655
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,591
Well, couldn't that
mean he is innocent?

656
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:00,103
It could, but I think
he fooled the machine.

657
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,606
He ramped up
his body's response
to the control questions

658
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,608
to cover up his Iies
about killing Carmen.

659
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:06,974
He wanted to take the test.
He knew he'd pass.

660
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:08,307
HUANG: Exactly.

661
00:30:09,347 --> 00:30:10,336
Captain.

662
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:12,280
You get anything
out of Tom Paysen?

663
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,978
He denies murdering
the girl and won't
roll over on the kid.

664
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:16,714
Even though
the Lamerlys
gave him up.

665
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:18,551
He's a cop.
He knows we have
no case against him.

666
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:21,353
Even if you get him for
tampering, the most he'II
get is a couple of years.

667
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:23,155
And one hell of
a Christmas bonus.

668
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:26,789
If we can't put Drew on that
balcony with Carmen,
we got no case against him.

669
00:30:26,865 --> 00:30:28,127
Thanks.

670
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,101
Maybe we do.
CSU found something.

671
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,633
There are traces of suede
in the abrasions on
the heel of Carmen's shoe.

672
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:37,904
BIue-dyed calfskin,
pretty nice material.

673
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:40,740
So it Iooks Iike something
caught in the heel,
Iike a blue suede jacket.

674
00:30:40,812 --> 00:30:42,211
Is that enough
for a warrant?

675
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,407
How many suede jackets are
running around Manhattan?

676
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:47,383
This suede was produced
by a toxic tanning process.

677
00:30:47,452 --> 00:30:48,476
For starters,

678
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:51,681
they used a hexavalent
instead of a polyvalent
chrome to clean the Ieather.

679
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:52,848
Okay, which means?

680
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:54,360
Not made in the U.S.
Probably comes from
one of your Baltic states.

681
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:56,794
If your perp has the jacket,
I can match it.

682
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,561
What's going on?

683
00:31:02,636 --> 00:31:04,126
We have a warrant to
search Drew's room.

684
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:05,933
What on earth for?

685
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,811
Kid's got taste.

686
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:15,314
Detectives,
can I help you?

687
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:17,009
We're helping ourselves,
thanks.

688
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,244
EIIiot.

689
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,423
Heel made
an impression.

690
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:28,288
Drew Lamerly,
turn around. Turn around.

691
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:31,426
You're under arrest
for the murder of
Carmen Trancoso.

692
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,491
You have the right
to remain silent.
If you give up that right,

693
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:37,696
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court
of Iaw.

694
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,466
You have the right
to an attorney...

695
00:31:42,342 --> 00:31:44,139
Okay, want to deal?

696
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:46,641
Getting cold feet,
Lorna?

697
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:47,839
Hardly.

698
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:51,248
Man two. He does five years
in a psychiatric institution.

699
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:54,950
Your client inflicts
a terrifying death
on a young woman

700
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:57,013
and you want him
to get counseling?

701
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,524
No. Murder two.
He does 25 years.

702
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:00,821
No, thanks.

703
00:32:00,894 --> 00:32:02,589
The results of
Drew's psych eval.

704
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:04,290
Here's your notice.

705
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:07,197
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

706
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:12,531
Diminished capacity
caused by brutalization
at the hands of his father?

707
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:14,198
You've got to be joking.

708
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:15,605
See if the jury Iaughs.

709
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,637
Well, it's an
impressive tactic.

710
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:23,911
Brutalization is part of
criminologist Lonnie Athens'
violentization theory.

711
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,214
Another Iame excuse
for criminal behavior?

712
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:27,344
Not necessarily.

713
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:29,889
Athens believes that
violent environment
and example

714
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:31,618
are the cause of all
violent criminal acts.

715
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:34,024
What, no interest in genetics
or brain chemistry?

716
00:32:34,094 --> 00:32:35,152
No.

717
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:37,719
Athens interviewed a hundred
convicted violent criminals

718
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:39,595
and found that they were
all abused as children.

719
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,258
AII saw family
members brutalized

720
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,132
and were all taught
to use extreme violence

721
00:32:43,203 --> 00:32:45,763
in response to stressful
and threatening situations.

722
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,535
We found nothing
that even hints
Drew was abused.

723
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:49,939
How am I going
to fight this?

724
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,500
By using Drew's
own words.

725
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:54,507
Defense claims
that Drew's
father abused him.

726
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,549
But in his polygraph
interview with me,

727
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:58,243
Drew said that his
relationship with his father

728
00:32:58,318 --> 00:33:00,047
was one of mutual
indifference.

729
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:06,920
SCARRY: Was Drew's
childhood happy?

730
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:09,919
It was comfortable,
not happy.

731
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:11,362
Why not?

732
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:12,728
He always had to succeed.

733
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,826
At school,
at sports,
at everything.

734
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:17,164
And if he didn't?

735
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,361
He was punished.

736
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,770
By whom?

737
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,869
By whom,
Mrs. Lamerly?

738
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,449
His father.
My son, Douglas.

739
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:32,683
Did his mother
not protect him?

740
00:33:32,753 --> 00:33:35,847
Grace tried,
but she was
terrified of Douglas.

741
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:38,186
That's why
she turned to alcohol.

742
00:33:38,258 --> 00:33:41,819
Several years ago
she checked herself
into a clinic in Bermuda

743
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,022
and Drew hasn't
seen her since.

744
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:46,361
Did Douglas
ever beat Drew?

745
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,798
Yes.

746
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,598
After a flunked
test or a Iost game.

747
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,369
Douglas said failure reflected
badly on the family,
made Drew Iess of a man.

748
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:01,110
Your Honor,
I am showing the witness
Defense Exhibit Three.

749
00:34:02,783 --> 00:34:05,684
Mrs. Lamerly,
do you recognize
this x-ray?

750
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,845
Drew's broken arm.

751
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,446
He got in a fight
at a hockey game,

752
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:13,618
and when he came home,
Douglas threw him
down the stairs.

753
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:15,593
Because he had
been in a fight?

754
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:18,028
Because he didn't
win the fight.

755
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,090
What happened
the next fight
that Drew was in?

756
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:25,832
He had to be pulled
off the other boy.
He nearly killed him.

757
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:28,898
So he had Iearned
the violent Iesson
his father had taught him?

758
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:30,374
Yes.

759
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,604
Thank you.

760
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:39,311
Mrs. Lamerly, you don't seem
to have a problem exposing
your own son in court.

761
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,911
I am mortified.

762
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:45,253
Douglas is my only son.
I failed him.

763
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:48,453
Don't mock me for
trying to redeem
myself with my grandson.

764
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,262
You say that your son
often abused Drew,

765
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:55,733
but in his interviews
with the police,
Drew never mentioned that.

766
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,099
In fact, Drew said...

767
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,606
Your Honor, the interview
to which the A.D.A. refers
was with a psychiatrist.

768
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:01,834
It's privileged.

769
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:04,638
Mr. Lamerly volunteered to do
the interview, Your Honor.

770
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,509
He was talking to
an FBI psychiatrist
in a police precinct.

771
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:10,175
A psychiatrist
is a psychiatrist.

772
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,718
My client had
the expectation
of privacy.

773
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:15,721
I'm sorry, Miss Cabot,
the interview is out.

774
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,992
You say that Douglas
taught Drew violence.

775
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:23,919
Did he also
teach him to rape?

776
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,090
He showed him
how to abuse women.

777
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,895
Drew's mother
will testify to that.

778
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,731
Unfortunately,
she's in Bermuda.

779
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:31,600
So do you have
some other examples?

780
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:36,832
He taught him to think
that women can be bought.

781
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,174
So does the advertising
industry.

782
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:42,647
The fact is that
Douglas didn't teach
Drew to rape, did he?

783
00:35:42,716 --> 00:35:44,775
Drew Iearned
that all on his own.

784
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,079
No.

785
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,916
From the age of 13,

786
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:51,659
Douglas took my grandson
to have sexual encounters
with prostitutes.

787
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:53,991
Buy a woman,
you can do anything
you want with her.

788
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:03,194
Mrs. Lamerly assassinates
her son and turns her
grandson into the victim.

789
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:04,705
I couldn't put
a dent in her.

790
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:06,798
Jury's buying this
brutalization crap, huh?

791
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,070
Well, so far
the evidence
supports it.

792
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:11,578
Drew got into fights,
he beat up Jenny White.

793
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:13,205
Maybe his dad
did brutalize him.

794
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:14,476
BENSON: You don't
believe that.

795
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,951
If Drew was a gang kid
with no dad and a mother
who was on crack,

796
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,113
we wouldn't blame them
for using an environment
defense.

797
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:21,713
I do blame
his environment.

798
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,782
He's a spoiled rich kid
whose family helps him get
away with rape and murder.

799
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,088
What can we do, AIex?

800
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:28,220
Well, the defense is going
to use violentization to say

801
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,458
that Drew was not
responsible for
his actions.

802
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:33,592
Carmen threatens him
and Drew's Iearned
response is violence.

803
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:36,035
So in a rush of rage,
he pushes her off the roof.

804
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,303
If we could prove
that there were
other cases

805
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:42,172
where Drew acted
violently without
provocation,

806
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:44,144
then we might
have a chance.

807
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:46,505
But who'II testify
against him?

808
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:53,453
Jennifer, we really
need you to testify.

809
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:54,648
No. I can't.

810
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:57,317
You're going to Iet
Drew Lamerly get away
with rape and murder.

811
00:36:57,392 --> 00:36:58,859
Very much,
will you
please just go?

812
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,360
I understand what
you have to Iose.

813
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,624
We've got to stop this guy,
and we can't do it
without you.

814
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:03,926
What's going on, Jen?

815
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:07,059
I can't. It's nothing.
Misunderstanding.

816
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:09,228
Who are you?
What do you want?

817
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:10,601
Police, Special Victims.

818
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:13,072
We were hoping we could speak
to your wife about something
that happened to her.

819
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:14,267
What?

820
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:15,537
It was before
you knew her.

821
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,010
It's not important,
Angus.

822
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:19,438
I know about
Jenny's past.

823
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,288
Well, maybe you don't
know the whole story.

824
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:29,620
She's my wife. Try me.

825
00:37:31,193 --> 00:37:32,717
Drew said he
needed a date.

826
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:37,122
He bought me a dress,
picked me up in his car.

827
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:40,566
For a while it was
as if I really was...

828
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:41,898
His prom date.

829
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:43,831
Yeah.

830
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,401
But Drew had been drinking.

831
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:52,174
He pulled me into a room,
started to have sex.

832
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:55,580
I went along with it.

833
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:59,951
After all,
that's how
I made my Iiving.

834
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:06,085
But suddenly he
slaps me and says,

835
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:09,756
"I'm not paying you
to enjoy it, bitch."

836
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:13,863
He ripped my dress.

837
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:16,369
He hit me
again and again.

838
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,069
And he raped me.

839
00:38:22,477 --> 00:38:24,968
He treat any of the other
girls the same way?

840
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:27,515
A couple said
he'd hit them.

841
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:30,415
But he was easier
to handle then.

842
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:33,113
He was 13, 14.

843
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,816
When his father
first brought him?

844
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:38,689
No, that was the sickest
thing about Drew.

845
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,489
He came with
his grandmother.

846
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:42,427
She'd pick
his girls for him.

847
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:54,805
I told Carmen
that it was over.

848
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:58,334
She got really upset,
ran out on the balcony.

849
00:38:59,414 --> 00:39:03,612
And I tried to calm her,
but she screamed at me,
hit me.

850
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,314
And then something
inside just snapped.

851
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,584
You... You saw red?

852
00:39:09,658 --> 00:39:10,852
Yes.

853
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,057
She kept on screaming
and kicking at me

854
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:18,265
and I pushed her
against the railing

855
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:22,626
and I just pushed
her and pushed her
until she fell.

856
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:25,696
SCARRY: Drew, did you
mean to kill her?

857
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:29,103
No, God, no.

858
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:31,736
Thank you.

859
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:42,814
Remind us again, Mr. Lamerly,
how did you break your arm?

860
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:51,555
I told you, my dad did it.

861
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:53,795
CABOT: Really?

862
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:57,265
Because I have affidavits
from your former headmaster

863
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:58,966
and the teacher
who took you to the ER,

864
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,100
and they could swear
that you did break
your arm playing hockey.

865
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:04,771
They remember because
they were afraid your parents
were going to sue.

866
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:06,336
Your Honor, we haven't
seen any of these.

867
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:09,873
It's the People's 23,
People's 24.

868
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,919
Go on, Miss Cabot.

869
00:40:11,987 --> 00:40:14,478
So tell us again, Mr. Lamerly,
how did you break your arm?

870
00:40:15,924 --> 00:40:17,084
Your father didn't do it.

871
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:19,192
He didn't touch you, did he?

872
00:40:20,862 --> 00:40:23,228
Yes. Yes, he did.

873
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,831
Mr. Lamerly,
do you recognize
this woman?

874
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,272
No, I don't.

875
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:35,172
Her name is Jennifer White

876
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:39,771
and I have a sworn
affidavit from her
as well, the People's 25,

877
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:42,510
that states that you
attacked and raped her
without provocation...

878
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:43,482
Your Honor...

879
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:46,180
...which
expressly contradicts
your violentization defense.

880
00:40:46,254 --> 00:40:47,414
Your Honor!

881
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,650
The jury will disregard
the Iast statement.

882
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:51,419
Miss Cabot,
watch your step.

883
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,858
Your Honor, I'm trying
to establish that

884
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:54,987
Mr. Lamerly's entire
defense is a Iie.

885
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:56,792
Then stick to
the facts in evidence.

886
00:40:56,865 --> 00:40:59,095
Do not try to
introduce new material.

887
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:05,328
You testified that
your father took you
to a brothel. Is that true?

888
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:06,499
Yes.

889
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:09,567
May I remind you
that you are under oath.

890
00:41:09,644 --> 00:41:11,475
I told you, it was him.

891
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:13,275
Who took you, Mr. Lamerly?

892
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:15,680
Stop it! Enough!
That's enough!

893
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,910
(GROANING)

894
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:19,184
SCARRY: Your Honor,
we need a doctor!

895
00:41:19,254 --> 00:41:20,915
Order! Order in the court!

896
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:24,015
How could you do
such a thing, you bitch?
It's all your fault!

897
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:26,185
You're going to pay for this!
You're going to pay for this!

898
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:28,752
You can trust me on that!
Get off of me! Get off of me!

899
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,762
Get him out of here.
Settle down!

900
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:31,492
Grandma!

901
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:41,574
Mother, it's the police.

902
00:41:41,643 --> 00:41:43,110
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Lamerly?

903
00:41:43,178 --> 00:41:44,236
I'II survive.

904
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:45,506
I hope so.

905
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,014
Long enough for you
to stand trial, anyway.

906
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,448
What are you
talking about?

907
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:52,612
Conspiracy, perjury, hindering
a prosecution. Do you want me
to go on?

908
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:54,279
You can't prove
a damn thing.

909
00:41:54,356 --> 00:41:57,189
We can. Douglas told
us everything

910
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:00,527
and now you'II be
joining Drew in prison.

911
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:03,328
What have you done?

912
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:06,431
I Iet you turn my son
into a monster.

913
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:08,093
You are nothing.

914
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:10,603
I built this family,
I kept it strong.

915
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:13,835
You never Ioved
Drew Iike I did.
I made him a man.

916
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,672
I made him a man.

917
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:17,639
You are nothing!

918
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:20,203
You never were anything!
You're nothing!
