00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,077
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,636
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,341
These are their stories.

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,280
Okay. AII right, guys,
we're playing Texas Hold 'em.

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,151
Again?
CHRISTIAN: This game's
all about balls.

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,383
Who's got them
and who's a skirt.

10
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,617
NOREEN: What if
I don't want balls?

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,819
Cheater.
Wives are allowed.

12
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,863
AII right, Michael,
make me proud. In or out?

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,889
Twenty.

14
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,194
Are those balls,
or what?

15
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,493
Call.

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,537
(DOORBELL RINGING)
You guys suck.

17
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,096
There's the food, hon.

18
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,198
ILKA: Raise 10.

19
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,072
I got nothing.

20
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,510
Oh. Hey, hey.

21
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,242
Hello?

22
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,475
(VOICE CUTTING OUT)

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,678
I didn't hear you.
Who's there?

24
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,551
Hon, I'm going down.
Something's wrong
with the intercom.

25
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,920
KIMBERLY:
Don't forget to tip him.

26
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,322
Yeah.

27
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,204
Police.
Let me see your hands.
What'd I do?

28
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,213
Turn around and place
your hands on the wall.

29
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,306
Up against the wall, now.
Michael Gardner,
you're under arrest.

30
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,715
I didn't do anything.
Hands above your head.
Left hand.

31
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,218
Look, you got the wrong guy,
whatever it is.

32
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,686
It's rape, Mr. Gardner.

33
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,779
What?

34
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,086
(GRUNTING)

35
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,517
STABLER: You okay?

36
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,719
Yeah.

37
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,493
You just made a big mistake.

38
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,860
KIMBERLY: My God,
what are you doing to him?

39
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,728
Stop. This is the police.
He's my husband.

40
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,825
Call Erin Russ.
She's a Iawyer in my book.

41
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,132
KIMBERLY: Why are you
arresting him?

42
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,571
Your husband raped four women.

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,074
Your dinner's here.
It's on NYPD.

44
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,990
I'm so sorry for hitting her.

45
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,466
I... I Iost my temper.
I take full responsibility.

46
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,971
How did my client get hurt
between his home and here?

47
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,132
I don't know. How?

48
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,335
He fell.
Bull.

49
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,810
The only injuries I see
are your client's
torn knuckles

50
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,109
from punching Detective Benson
in the face.

51
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,582
So unless you want to add
assault of a police officer
to the tab,

52
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,175
I say we move on.

53
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,117
I did not rape anyone.

54
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,711
You have the wrong person.

55
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,087
Well, we got
a print at the scene

56
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,523
matching one from
your assault bust.

57
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,960
Yeah, from a college
bar fight 10 years ago.

58
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,488
AII you've got is one print
on an exterior metal railing

59
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,434
of an apartment building
two blocks from where
Mr. Gardner Iives.

60
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,403
I walk my dog all over
that neighborhood.

61
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,803
You'II find my prints
in front of 20 buildings.

62
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,935
One print at one scene
doesn't add up to four rapes.

63
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,241
Your detectives
are getting Iazy.

64
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,303
Hardly.

65
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,380
Mr. Gardner did us the favor
of Ieaving his calling card
at the scene.

66
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,783
You choke them
till they pass out,
then you rape them,

67
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,286
then you cut their breasts.

68
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,652
It's called
a pattern, Mikey.

69
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,883
A vague pattern

70
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,949
that 100 guys at Attica
have used.

71
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,859
You've got no DNA, no prints
at any other scene.

72
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,558
We have your client's
description from
one of his victims.

73
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,329
She pretended
to be unconscious,
even after you cut her.

74
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,700
CABOT: We're giving you
a chance to cooperate,
Mr. Gardner.

75
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,500
You'd go a Iong way
towards helping yourself

76
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,100
if you would tell us
everything that you know
about the attacks.

77
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,977
There were no attacks.

78
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,513
We're done.

79
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,913
If they had a victim,
you'd already be in a Iine-up.

80
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,417
CABOT: She's right.

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,620
That's your next stop.

82
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:22,226
Carrie, if you're ready,
I'd Iike to take you
into the Iine-up now.

83
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,361
I don't think
that I can do it.

84
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,525
You can't see him again,

85
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
or you can't identify him?

86
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,770
No, no, I didn't get
a good Iook at him.

87
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,238
And I...

88
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,638
What if I don't pick
the right person?

89
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,732
Don't worry about that.

90
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,142
Your only responsibility is
to say what you think is true.

91
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,612
Okay, but

92
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,873
if I pick the wrong
person, then...

93
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,878
Then he gets away,
and I...

94
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,013
You told me
at the rape crisis center

95
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,215
that I don't have
to do anything

96
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,349
that I don't want to do.

97
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,017
That's right, you don't.

98
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,653
Okay, hold on.
Why don't we back up
for a second?

99
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,596
Let's forget about the Iine-up
right now, all right?

100
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,793
I just want to see how
good your memory is.

101
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:03,995
Okay?

102
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,700
I can't.

103
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,475
I... I can't go
through that again.

104
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,775
I haven't even
told my fiancÃ©e.

105
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,408
Carrie, I just want to talk
about what you saw, okay?

106
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,485
You know what?
Why don't we sit down
for a second, all right?

107
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,854
Let's sit down. Come on.

108
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,289
You said that you passed out
when somebody choked you
from behind.

109
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,063
What's the first thing that
you remember when you woke up?

110
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,571
I was on the ground,
I was on my back

111
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,802
and he was on top of me.

112
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,138
Did he say anything?

113
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,269
No.

114
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,314
What color was his hair?

115
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,074
Brown.

116
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,948
Straight?
Kind of wavy.

117
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,682
And did you see
the color of his eyes?

118
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,421
Dark. Brown, I guess.

119
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,793
Okay. What else?
Can you remember
anything else about his face?

120
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,991
Anything at all?

121
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,069
He had dark eyebrows.

122
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,538
He was clean-shaven.

123
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,541
He had a...

124
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,041
A scar over his right eye.

125
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,338
And I think that
I saw his car.

126
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,850
After, he got into
a white truck.

127
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,718
Carrie, you remember.

128
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,815
You know what he Iooks Iike.

129
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,924
Now all I need you to do
is point him out.

130
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,693
Can Bethany come with me?

131
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,493
Sure.

132
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,002
Now, I'm gonna talk to Bethany
outside for a second.

133
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,665
Can I get you anything?

134
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,439
No.
AII right.

135
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,216
Listen, Bethany, this case
Iives or dies by her ID.

136
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,310
So no helping,
just emotional support.

137
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,877
I'm a rape crisis
counselor, Detective.

138
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,252
I've done this before.
Yeah, I know.

139
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,382
I just really want
to get this guy.

140
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,485
She'II do it. She's
stronger than she thinks.

141
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,242
What if it's not him?
It means he's still out there?

142
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,868
Don't think about it.
Just do it.

143
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,072
Want me to Ieave the room
so you can tell her
who to pick?

144
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,876
Oh, give it a rest.

145
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,784
Carrie,
take your time.

146
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,795
BENSON: Carrie,
do you recognize anyone?

147
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,965
And what number
is he holding?

148
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,305
Three.

149
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,902
And where do you
recognize him from?

150
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,544
He's the man who raped me.

151
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,083
Okay, we're done.

152
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,218
That's it.

153
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,931
I thought you had
four victims.

154
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,229
I only need one ID.

155
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,894
Not if it's wrong.

156
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,098
My client Iives in
that woman's neighborhood.

157
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,539
She could've seen him anywhere
and gotten confused.

158
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,803
It was a clean pick.

159
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,539
And victims' memories
are always accurate?

160
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,807
They are when they're right.

161
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,212
You've got three others.

162
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,273
Why not bring them in
for the Iine-up too?

163
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,615
Because you know
they can't ID him.

164
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,210
Jury's going to hear that.

165
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,518
The suspect is being
booked right now.

166
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,619
Thank God.

167
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,823
Okay,
he will be arraigned,

168
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,299
and then the case goes
before the grand jury.

169
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,926
Now, you'II all
need to testify.

170
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,436
Will he be there?
No.

171
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,473
But if the grand jury indicts,
then we move
to the trial phase.

172
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,906
You'II all have
to testify again,

173
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,375
and in that case
he will be in the courtroom.

174
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,741
Will he stay in jail
the whole time?

175
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,336
BENSON: Well, that depends
on if the judge decides

176
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,439
to set bail and
if he can afford it.

177
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,950
Why does he even get bail?
He raped us.

178
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,920
The Iaw only allows remand
in murder cases.

179
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,888
He knows where I Iive.
Where?

180
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,118
Upper West Side.
So do I.

181
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,523
What's his address?

182
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,959
I'm not allowed
to give that to you.

183
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,053
But he could have followed me.

184
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,963
Even if he did, it's not
in his best interest
to seek you out.

185
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,967
It wasn't in his best interest
to rape us either,

186
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,024
but that didn't stop him.

187
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,697
The Assistant District
Attorney can ask the judge
for an order of protection.

188
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,105
That means that if he
harasses any one of you,

189
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,439
he will face
additional charges.

190
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,376
However, if we tell him
to stay away from you,

191
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,882
then I'II have to
give him your home
and your work addresses.

192
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,247
Even though you
can't give us his?

193
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,479
BENSON: He has to know
where he's not allowed to go.

194
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,246
I want an order of protection.

195
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,824
Yeah, okay, okay.

196
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,129
Mr. Wonderful's a free man
as of two hours ago.

197
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,397
Made bail
courtesy of the wife.

198
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,938
On the positive side,

199
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,065
the judge granted
orders of protection
for every victim.

200
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,701
Well, on the negative side,
I checked with the DMV,

201
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,007
Gardner never registered a car
here. Neither has his wife.

202
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,809
And nobody's seen him
driving a white truck.

203
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,712
Now that we've got
Carrie's positive ID,

204
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,842
I want to take a closer Iook
at the other three attacks.

205
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,183
Well, there's no
apparent connection
between the victims.

206
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,088
These two Iived
on the Upper West,
she Iived in Midtown, SoHo.

207
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,750
Gardner does Iike
working outdoors.

208
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,556
He caught two of them
coming home from work.

209
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,325
One getting off the N train,
the other one
getting out of a cab.

210
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,764
These are pretty public places
to do that kind of damage

211
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,563
and not be seen
by a single person.

212
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,230
Maybe he did a Iittle recon
before the attacks.

213
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,830
He sits on a place,
makes sure that there's
not a Iot of traffic.

214
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,637
AII right, Carrie,
I want you to calm down,
I want you to stay there.

215
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,804
Do not say anything,
do not approach him.
Do you understand me?

216
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,404
We'II be right there.

217
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,016
That was Carrie Huitt.

218
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,985
Gardner just followed her
into a coffee shop.

219
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,056
Hey. Excuse me.
Where is he?

220
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,253
He Ieft.

221
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,592
I'II see if
he's still around.

222
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,895
Did he say anything?

223
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,962
He smiled, he said hello...

224
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,133
I don't even know how
he knew that I was here.

225
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,539
I just walked in here,
and he's standing there
in Iine.

226
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,204
Wait a minute.
He followed you in here,
or he was here already?

227
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,679
He was here.
How did he know?

228
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,773
It's not enough.

229
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,319
Hold on, AIex.
You think this is
a coincidence?

230
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,220
Probably not.
But a judge won't
call it a violation.

231
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,655
She entered the establishment,

232
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,022
so in essence
she followed him.

233
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,424
Gardner's got to know
where Carrie Iives.

234
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,792
He attacked her right in
front of her own building.

235
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,058
If he's stalking her,
he's got to know where
she gets her coffee.

236
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,191
His Iawyer will argue
that they Iive in
the same neighborhood.

237
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,463
It's not implausible
they would frequent
the same places.

238
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,097
Orders of protection
are real helpful when
you can't enforce them.

239
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,970
Look, he didn't try anything,

240
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,066
and there is the chance
it was a coincidence.

241
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,633
I doubt it.

242
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,148
Gardner's meticulous.
Everything he does
is carefully planned.

243
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,013
He strikes me as
a power-reassurance rapist.

244
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,612
Perfect job, good Iooks,
access to sex with his wife.

245
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,282
But he rapes because he's
insecure about his manhood.

246
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,052
Cutting the breast
of his victim
is Iike marking her.

247
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,684
In a sense, he owns her
for the rest of her Iife.

248
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,389
So he slugs OIivia because
she took that power away.

249
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,329
Right.
And now he wants it back,
and the way to get it is

250
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,832
to instill fear
in his victims.

251
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,834
By intimidating them
into not testifying.

252
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,836
That, and he
gets off on it.

253
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,566
I don't suppose
we can put the witnesses
in protective custody.

254
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,404
There's no money. City's
Iaying off cops as it is.

255
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,139
We don't have the manpower
to sit on him all day either.

256
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,544
AII we can do
is warn the victims

257
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,241
and hope Gardner
is feeling manly enough

258
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,908
to stay away from them.

259
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,580
STABLER: We can't be sure
Gardner will do anything.

260
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,488
This is more of a precaution
than trying to scare you.

261
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,220
Yeah, Iike terror alerts.

262
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,420
BRENDAN: Mommy?

263
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,161
Stay inside, Brendan.

264
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,731
I'm hungry now.
Yeah, I know, honey.

265
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,235
You know, we're gonna have
dinner in just a second.

266
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,203
Why don't you go back inside?
I'II be right there.

267
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,331
BENSON: Karen, is there
anyplace that you can go?

268
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,205
Maybe a friend or a relative
that you can stay with
until the trial?

269
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,711
What am I supposed to do,
pull him out of school?

270
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,769
Look, I don't have any family,

271
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,509
and my friends can't put up me
and a Iittle boy.

272
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,675
Maybe I should
just quit my job

273
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,013
and Iock myself
in my house all day.

274
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,212
BENSON: I know that
this is difficult.

275
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,777
You know nothing.

276
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,556
Can't blame her
for being angry.

277
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,859
Our job's to protect her.
We can't even do that.

278
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,963
Son of a bitch.

279
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,733
Police, Gardner. Get up.

280
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,972
What's wrong?
STABLER: Let's see your hands.

281
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,241
What's wrong?
Up against the car.

282
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,441
You are under arrest.

283
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,313
Why are you harassing me?
I didn't do anything.

284
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,512
Violating an order
of protection, you moron.

285
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,078
You just bought yourself
a cell in Rikers.

286
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,249
(DOG WHIMPERING)
Let's go.

287
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,432
"Docket ending 6221,
People v. Michael Gardner.

288
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,409
"Intimidating a victim
in the Third Degree,

289
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,944
"menacing in

290
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,503
"stalking in

291
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,379
Your Iawyer running Iate,
Mr. Gardner?

292
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,044
I fired my attorney,
Your Honor.
I'm representing myself.

293
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,382
Oh, that's wonderful.
Approach.

294
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,758
Your Honor, Mr. Gardner
is currently under indictment
for multiple rapes.

295
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,317
This is simply another way for
him to torture his victims.

296
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,726
I have the right
to defend myself.

297
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,857
Only if you understand
the implications
of your decision.

298
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,493
You'II be held to
the same standards
as any attorney.

299
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,558
I understand.

300
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,970
I'II grant your Pro Se request
for these proceedings.

301
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,667
Now, as far as
the rape indictment goes,

302
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,176
you'II have to take it up
with the trial judge.

303
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,769
AII right, step back.

304
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,941
Now, as to the charges
on the table,

305
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,813
how does the defendant plead?

306
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,113
Not guilty.

307
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,312
Let's hear arguments.

308
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,116
The defendant is under
orders of protection

309
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,248
against four women
he's accused of raping.

310
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,191
He violated these orders
by approaching one victim
in a coffee shop

311
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,161
and hiding out in front of
another victim's home.

312
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,026
I wasn't hiding,
I was walking my dog.

313
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,692
One coincidence I can buy,
two are stalking.

314
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,099
I don't even know
what she's talking about.
I was buying coffee.

315
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,267
If someone saw me
in that shop,
I didn't see them.

316
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,966
What contact did the defendant
have with the second woman?

317
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,771
None. The detectives
arrested him in order
to prevent that.

318
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,869
So how did I violate
any order?

319
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,244
Unless the People have
something else to give me,
you didn't.

320
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,839
Your Honor,
this is the defendant's MO.

321
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,375
He delights in continually
victimizing women
he's already raped.

322
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,718
COHEN: The next time,
bring me evidence
that supports your theory.

323
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,489
I'm dismissing all complaints
as facially insufficient.
Next case.

324
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,225
Gardner's repping himself
at his rape trial too?

325
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,771
Yes. Judge Preston
granted his request.

326
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,534
She appointed Russ
as his standby counsel.

327
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,098
How can Preston allow that?

328
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,837
CABOT: There's not much
she can do to prevent it.

329
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,538
Normally, I would consider
this a win, but...

330
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,843
But Gardner just handed you
your ass in arraignment?

331
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,146
Yeah, I was hoping the judge
would see that this was
in no way a coincidence.

332
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,584
Gardner didn't attack
Karen Leighton near her home.

333
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,214
He got her address from
the order of protection.

334
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,484
I mean, we try
to protect them,

335
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,493
and then we end up
giving the guy a map
to find his victims.

336
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,461
I mean, next time we should
just drive him there.

337
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,327
FIN: The judge granted
the bastard bail.

338
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,628
Orders of protection were
the best we could do.

339
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,261
We get anything useful
from Gardner's associates?

340
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,862
I spoke to his wife, his
business partner, neighbors.

341
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,739
Same story, great guy,
never a harsh word,
couldn't have done it.

342
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,072
So who gets to
tell the victims

343
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,771
their rapist gets another
crack at them in court?

344
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:21,938
I will do it.

345
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,140
PARALEGAL: AIexandra Cabot?

346
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,974
Yeah, that's me.

347
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,576
Your office said
I'd find you here.

348
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,689
Now what?

349
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,350
Gardner's hitting
the ground running.

350
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,860
Motion to sever the charges.

351
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,129
In three of the four cases,
police found no evidence
implicating me.

352
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,671
Article 200.20
of C.P.L. states,

353
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,300
that offenses are joinable
when proof of one is material
as evidence of the others.

354
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,866
I'm saying
you have no proof.

355
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,071
A positive identification
by Carrie Huitt

356
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,546
and your fingerprint
at the scene of the rape.

357
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,014
Do the People have
any other evidence

358
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,914
other than the pattern
of the attacks

359
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,010
to support the joinder
of the indictments?

360
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,647
We don't need any, Your Honor.
People v. West,

361
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,247
when the MO
is sufficiently unique,

362
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,816
multiple crimes can be charged
under one indictment.

363
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,795
The pattern in all four rapes
is identical.

364
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,264
Forgive me, Your Honor,
I'm not as well-versed
as Ms. Cabot.

365
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,261
People v. Sable.

366
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,739
When there is substantially
more proof on one offense
than the others,

367
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,072
there is a substantial
Iikelihood that the jury
would be unable

368
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,704
to consider separately
the proof as it relates
to each offense.

369
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,975
I believe that means
the jury's decision
on the first three victims

370
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,279
would be unfairly influenced
by the fourth.

371
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,412
That's right on the money,
Mr. Gardner.
It's called bootstrapping.

372
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,886
I'm severing all counts.

373
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,548
Your Honor, the particularly
heinous nature

374
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,217
of the crimes makes...
Would serve to only

375
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,488
further prejudice the jury.

376
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,688
That's it, Ms. Cabot.

377
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,563
Then I'd Iike to make a motion
to dismiss all charges
based on Iack of evidence.

378
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,728
I think the evidence
against Mr. Gardner
has been amply established.

379
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,205
For the fourth victim, it has.
For the others,
not even close.

380
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,233
The indictments for victims
one through three
are hereby dismissed.

381
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,212
Any other business
we need to deal with?

382
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,308
Good. Opening statements
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
We're adjourned.

383
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,150
Unless this guy passed
the board overnight,

384
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,523
Erin Russ is giving him
a Iot of help.

385
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,289
Don't worry.
We'II still nail him
with Carrie's testimony.

386
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,023
Well, not if she
won't give it.

387
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,396
I just got a message
from Bethany Taylor.

388
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,402
Carrie says she can't
face her rapist again.

389
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,470
I'm really sorry.

390
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,838
Could you tell me why
you changed your mind?

391
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,843
You know why.

392
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,347
I don't want to talk to him,
I don't want to hear him.

393
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,609
You know, I have to
get on with my Iife.

394
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,945
I can't keep
going back to this.

395
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,110
Carrie, how are you going
to get on with your Iife

396
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,882
knowing that Gardner
got away with it?

397
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,356
It's not my fault,
it's not my responsibility.

398
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,690
That's right, you're only
responsible for yourself.

399
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,364
Did you discuss
some of the positive things

400
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,300
that could come out
of a victim testifying
against her rapist?

401
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,300
It's often empowering.
The attack was
out of your control,

402
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,307
but in court you have
complete control.

403
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,866
And even though Gardner
is doing the questioning,

404
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,741
he is bound by
the rules of the court.

405
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,281
AII that you're bound by
is the truth.

406
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,407
I just want...

407
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,248
I just want to get over it.
When am I going
to get over it?

408
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,348
Carrie, I have never
known a single victim

409
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:24,327
who regretted testifying
against her rapist,
no matter how hard it was.

410
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:28,196
But I have known plenty
that wished that they had.

411
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,462
And by then, it was too Iate.

412
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,813
And he kept running
his hand through my hair,
almost gentle.

413
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,877
And...

414
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,854
That's when I opened
my eyes a Iittle.

415
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,185
And you saw his face?

416
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,281
Yes.

417
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,518
Ms. Huitt, do you see the man

418
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,563
who attacked you
in the courtroom here today?

419
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,556
Yes.

420
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,228
There.

421
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:08,003
Let the record reflect the
witness has identified the
defendant, Michael Gardner.

422
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,768
Thank you, Carrie.

423
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,877
Ms. Huitt,

424
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:22,049
you testified that your
attacker choked you
until you passed out.

425
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,216
Yes.

426
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,189
You tied a cord
around my neck.

427
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,352
But your attacker was
standing behind you, so

428
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,760
you didn't see him then.

429
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,661
I saw you Iater.

430
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,393
When you woke up.

431
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:41,529
And you testified
that your attacker
sexually assaulted you?

432
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,840
You forced your penis
into my vagina.

433
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,879
And when you opened your eyes,

434
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,112
a Iittle,
did your attacker see that?

435
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,983
You weren't paying attention.

436
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,160
MICHAEL: How close
was he to you?

437
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,121
You were six inches
away from my face.

438
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,292
And he didn't notice
you were awake?

439
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,271
Isn't that strange,
if he was so close?

440
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,465
Is it possible
he was farther away?
Objection.

441
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,235
He can ask the same question
20 different ways,

442
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,140
and her answer
will be the same.

443
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,008
Move on, Mr. Gardner.

444
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,908
MICHAEL: The night you saw me
at the police station,
was anyone with you?

445
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:30,581
Yes. A counselor from
the rape crisis center.

446
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,920
Bethany Taylor.

447
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,619
Did you talk to her
that night?

448
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,786
Yes.

449
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,897
What about?
Objection.

450
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,423
Communications between
a rape crisis counselor
and a victim are privileged.

451
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,867
Sustained.

452
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,097
I have no other questions.

453
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,241
Once the fingerprint
came back,

454
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,250
we apprehended the defendant
outside of his home.

455
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,047
I advised him
of his Miranda rights.

456
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,112
Detectives Stabler and
Tutuola questioned him
with his attorney present,

457
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,021
and Carrie Huitt
positively identified him

458
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,856
as the man who had raped her
the night before.

459
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,725
Thank you, Detective.

460
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,025
Why didn't you question me,
Detective Benson?

461
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,467
I was preparing your victim
for the Iine-up.

462
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,595
Oh.

463
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,664
So it wasn't
because I punched you
earlier that night?

464
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,901
Objection. Relevance.

465
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,239
I'm trying to ascertain
whether the detective
has a personal stake

466
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,835
in my arrest and prosecution.

467
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,645
I'II allow it.

468
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,581
I have no personal
stake in you.

469
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,243
You weren't mad at me?

470
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,517
Or, embarrassed
that I eluded your grasp
in front of your colleagues?

471
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,889
It's not uncommon
for a perpetrator to
Iose control of himself.

472
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,793
And I have certainly
been hit much harder.

473
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,728
When Detective Tutuola took me
into the Iine-up room,

474
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:55,637
I saw you in the corridor
of your precinct.
Who were you talking to?

475
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,937
Bethany Taylor.

476
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,034
The rape crisis counselor.

477
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,638
What were you
talking about?
CABOT: Objection.

478
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,875
I think we've
already established

479
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,474
counselor communications
are privileged.

480
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,180
Actually, only communications
with the victim
are privileged,

481
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,847
not with Iaw enforcement.

482
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,381
Your objection's overruled.
The witness may
answer the question.

483
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,156
I was advising Ms. Taylor
not to interfere
with the Iine-up

484
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,061
so that it would be
fair and impartial.

485
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:24,967
I saw you Iooking at me
in that corridor, correct?

486
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,230
Yes.

487
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,572
I also saw Ms. Taylor
Iook at me.

488
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,535
You'II have to ask her.

489
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,910
Where did she go after
she finished talking to you?

490
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,308
Into the interview room.

491
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,215
And who else was
in that interview room?

492
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,316
Carrie Huitt.

493
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,256
So the sequence of events
goes Iike this.

494
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,462
Bethany Taylor talked to you,
then saw me in handcuffs.

495
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,160
After that she talked
to the victim alone.

496
00:23:56,234 --> 00:24:00,261
And only then,
after all this talking,
did the victim identify me.

497
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,806
Objection.
That's okay. I'm done.

498
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,478
This is crap, AIex.
Yeah?

499
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,038
'Cause it Iooks to me
Iike Michael Gardner
making a really good case

500
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,208
for tainted identification.

501
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,979
I wish you'd told me
about this, OIivia.
Hold on.

502
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,280
That Iine-up
was not tainted.

503
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,752
How do you know?

504
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:20,553
What could a rape counselor
possibly gain from helping
a victim make a false ID?

505
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,887
It doesn't matter
what happens,

506
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,552
only what appears
to have happened.

507
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,890
Oh, come...
If the judge
tosses this ID,

508
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,760
this case is screwed.

509
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,457
Bethany, what's up?

510
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:33,334
I just got subpoenaed
to testify on
Michael Gardner's behalf.

511
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,640
This isn't up for debate,
Your Honor.

512
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,178
The Iaw clearly states
a rape counselor
cannot disclose

513
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,645
unless the victim
authorizes it

514
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,341
or reveals intent
to commit a harmful act.

515
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,247
Well, it's my understanding
I have a right to due process.

516
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,479
How can I defend myself
if I don't know all the
evidence against me?

517
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,111
The counselor's records
and testimony

518
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,849
were never in evidence.
Exactly.

519
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,185
So no one really knows
what was said.

520
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,488
And you can't go on
a fishing expedition
to find out.

521
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,688
People v. Pena held
that the defendant
cannot go on a roving tour

522
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,025
through somebody's
personal information

523
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,497
without a stated purpose.

524
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,158
Well, I have a very
specific purpose.

525
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,361
She saw me
before the Iine-up,

526
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,063
then had a private
conversation with the victim.

527
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,004
I have a right to know if she
told her what I Iooked Iike
or what I was wearing.

528
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,872
AII right. I'II question
Ms. Taylor in chambers.

529
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:15,606
If I feel her testimony
is material to
Mr. Gardner's defense,

530
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,614
the jury will hear it.

531
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,549
How'd it go?
Great. Didn't say a thing.

532
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,682
What do you mean,
you didn't say a thing?
You're under subpoena.

533
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,191
You don't have a choice.
Yeah, I do.

534
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,785
Bethany, this isn't
going to help anybody.

535
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,352
Detective Benson,

536
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,830
I need you to take Ms. Taylor
into custody for contempt.

537
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,198
Wait, Judge, there's
got to be another...
Either you do it,

538
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,396
or I'II get someone else to.

539
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,039
Let's go.

540
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,075
Save it.

541
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,017
Nothing good is going to
come from this, Bethany.

542
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,645
I won't break privilege.

543
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,986
CABOT: Well, it's going to be
broken with or without you.

544
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,457
Judge Preston has
made her decision.

545
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:02,959
She wants to hear
your testimony.

546
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,359
I won't give it.
End of story.

547
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,057
Well, did you tell Carrie
what Gardner Iooked Iike
before the Iine-up?

548
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,726
You know I didn't.
Then what does it matter?

549
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,359
Tell Preston what
you talked about.

550
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,427
She'II find it immaterial
to the defense,

551
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,302
and then no one else
has to hear about it.

552
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,273
Then the precedent is set.

553
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,834
And every subsequent rape
survivor gets to wonder,
can I talk about this

554
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,972
or will everything I say
be broadcast on Court TV?

555
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,815
No one will trust us,
and no one will
report the crimes.

556
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,514
CABOT: So what's your plan?
To spend the rest
of your Iife in here?

557
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,853
I brought my toothbrush.
I'II do the bid.

558
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,414
Well, that's fine.

559
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,756
But in the meantime,
this case goes down
as a mistrial

560
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,661
or an acquittal,
and Michael Gardner walks.

561
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,866
What if the victim
waives privilege?

562
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,663
No.

563
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,431
I think Judge Preston'II
go for it.

564
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,302
Then privilege is intact
and no precedent is set.

565
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,002
You would put this
on Carrie?

566
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,443
Do you have any idea
how damaging this could be?

567
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:55,945
Bethany, what else
do you want me to do?

568
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,481
Not that.

569
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,076
I mean it.
She can't handle it.

570
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,815
You're supposed to help
the victims. Do your job.

571
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,231
BENSON: You heard what
happened with Bethany.

572
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,289
Mmm-hmm.

573
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,431
Carrie, I...

574
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,497
I'm asking you to waive
your right to privacy

575
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:27,341
so that Bethany
can testify about her
conversation with you.

576
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,981
You're not wearing
your engagement ring.

577
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,082
Yeah, that was my decision.

578
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:42,589
I didn't want Eric to
have to wait around for me
to get back to normal.

579
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,288
I couldn't have sex
without crying.

580
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,633
I Iove him, but I'm never
going to be back to normal.

581
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,793
Carrie, I really don't think
that this is the right time

582
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,803
to be making
these kind of decisions.

583
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,338
When is the right time?

584
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,265
You're all sitting around

585
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,537
waiting for me
to shake this off
and get back to normal.

586
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,781
You have no idea.

587
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,392
I can't sleep more than
20 minutes a night.

588
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:23,462
I hate to be alone.
But, God, I hate to
be around people more.

589
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:29,001
And I am so afraid
to walk outside or
be in a crowded place,

590
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,599
because, you know,
I might see him.

591
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,672
And all I can think to myself
is it would've been
so much better

592
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,649
if he'd just killed me.

593
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,284
So, that's what I talked
to Bethany about,

594
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,122
because she told me
that I could say
anything to her

595
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,288
and no one would ever know.

596
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:02,200
Nothing that I do
will ever change
what happened to you.

597
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:06,209
I can only try to prevent it
from happening again.

598
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,802
Except everything that
I have done has failed.

599
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,213
I'm not going to pretend
that this is a good thing

600
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,581
or that this is
a fair thing,

601
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,948
but I have to ask you
for your help

602
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,847
because

603
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,118
you are our Iast chance.

604
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,031
I hate to see you in here.

605
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,835
Don't worry about me.
This was my decision,
not yours.

606
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,705
I waived my rights.

607
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,711
And I wish she didn't
make you do that.

608
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,644
But it doesn't mean anything.
I still won't talk.

609
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,682
It's my decision,
and it's already done.

610
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:50,115
You said that this is
about control, right?
Taking it back. Well, I am.

611
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,955
I do not want there
to be any chance that
this guy can get away.

612
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,356
So please testify
to the judge.

613
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,128
It's okay. It's...
It can't get any worse.

614
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,334
After questioning
Bethany Taylor,
it is my ruling

615
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,071
that her testimony
is not relevant to
the pre-trial identification

616
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,478
and that the defendant's
right to due process
has not been violated.

617
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,040
Therefore, the testimony will
not be entered into record.

618
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,142
Objection!

619
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,743
PRESTON: You can't object,
Mr. Gardner.

620
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,913
Take a seat.

621
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,216
No, that's not fair.

622
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,885
That is my ruling.
We're adjourned for today.

623
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,894
So what else can Gardner pull
when he puts up
his own defense?

624
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,696
I expect he'II throw
a couple of character
witnesses on the stand,

625
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,259
he'II take his
own testimony.

626
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,396
We just have to be ready
for anything that he does.

627
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,632
Detective!

628
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,908
Bethany, I know
you didn't want this,

629
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:46,966
but thank you anyway.

630
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,570
I didn't do this for you.
I did it for Carrie.

631
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,274
Want to know what
you did, Detective?

632
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,318
This is a subpoena
from a man who raped
another client of mine.

633
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,478
He wants her
records disclosed.

634
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,886
So I was thinking
you'd be the perfect person

635
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,255
to bully her into
waiving her rights.

636
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,226
I did what I had to do
to stop Michael Gardner

637
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,454
from raping another woman.

638
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,327
Six of my clients
already quit counseling.

639
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,990
They don't trust me anymore.

640
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:13,197
But you got your win.
Who cares if it's at
everyone else's expense?

641
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:22,837
Where is everybody?

642
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:28,145
Kathy took the kids
to La Boheme. Pass.

643
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,551
So on your one night
as a bachelor, you go
to the grocery store?

644
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,522
That's pretty pathetic.

645
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,519
Grocery store with strippers.

646
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,026
Liv, you've got to Iet it go.

647
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,492
You put a rapist on trial.
You did your job.

648
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,093
I think I made it worse.

649
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,830
You know that's not true.

650
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,803
I made Carrie relive
the worst thing that's
ever happened to her.

651
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,413
I screwed
any number of victims

652
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,953
who might have
sought counseling
from Bethany Taylor.

653
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,319
And a few Iess rapes
may be reported
because of it.

654
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,618
And if Michael Gardner
is convicted,

655
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,988
he'II never rape
another woman.

656
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,686
It's not worth it.

657
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,829
It's not worth the cost.

658
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:13,955
To you or them?

659
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,200
I'm not talking about me.

660
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,565
Yeah, you are.

661
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,773
For as Iong as
I have known you,

662
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,272
you've always identified
with the victims.

663
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,676
Now, maybe that's because
you're a woman.

664
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,548
I don't know.

665
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,950
I do know
it's one of the things
that makes you a great cop.

666
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,251
It's also one of the things
that makes this job
torture sometimes.

667
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:51,465
You can never go back
and change things that have
already happened, OIivia.

668
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,867
You can't.

669
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:04,570
You kill yourself
to make something happen,

670
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,344
or you do nothing.

671
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,482
And it doesn't matter.

672
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,113
There's always
another child molester,

673
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,715
there's always another rapist.

674
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,352
And it's Iike

675
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,896
you have to sell

676
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,092
a Iittle piece of yourself
to get the job done.

677
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,365
So what the hell's the point?

678
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,509
I don't know.
Maybe there isn't a point.

679
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,277
Maybe the cost is too high.

680
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,485
OIivia, no one's
making you do this.

681
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:54,725
The difference between
you and all the victims
is you can walk away.

682
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:00,837
No, I can't.

683
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,786
PRESTON: We've been waiting
for over an hour,

684
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,254
Ms. Russ.
We have no proof

685
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,224
that Mr. Gardner has
absconded, Your Honor.

686
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,989
If the defendant has
knowingly forfeited
his right to be present,

687
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,258
then the trial should
continue without him.

688
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,266
For all we know,
he could have fallen ill
or been in an accident.

689
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,503
Find out, Ms. Russ. Quickly.

690
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,575
Got it. AII airports
are on alert.

691
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,804
So far, he hasn't shown up
on any passenger manifests.

692
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,368
We're focusing
on domestic flights.

693
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,142
His wife said that
his passport's expired.

694
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,080
Which you don't need
to drive into Canada,

695
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,313
so Customs along
the New York-Ontario
borders are on alert.

696
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,083
Locals are putting Gardner's
mug shot on the 11:00 news.

697
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,350
It'II be in the papers
in the morning.

698
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,857
But there's still
a possibility

699
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,360
that he's staying in town
despite the danger.

700
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,157
He's already shown
a propensity for stalking,

701
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,425
which means that any number
of people could be a target.

702
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:05,492
That's why I want warnings out
to the judge, the D.A.s,
every witness, victim, juror.

703
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,969
Anybody who set foot
in that courtroom

704
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,164
that he could see
as an enemy.

705
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,867
STABLER: Stabler.
That includes you, OIivia.

706
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,967
This guy's got
a hard-on for you.

707
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,342
Good. I hope
he tries something.

708
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,041
He did try something.
Another attack.

709
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,584
Neighbor found her when
he was taking out the garbage,

710
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,641
but he didn't hear a thing.

711
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,778
Victim get a Iook at him?

712
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,016
Don't know. She's dead.

713
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,723
STABLER: Cut up her face,
too, this time.

714
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,990
Three or four slashes.
Fingerprint bruising
around the neck.

715
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,190
I think
he's getting smarter.

716
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,426
This time, there's
nobody to ID him.

717
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,262
Victim's Evelyn Sharpe
from Staten Island.

718
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,241
You were right about
the manual strangulation.

719
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,710
Found traces of talc,
so I'm guessing
he wore Iatex gloves.

720
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,644
So he's Iearning
from his mistakes.

721
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,683
Her hands have
some defensive wounds.

722
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,240
Bruises on her knuckles.

723
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,684
So I'm thinking she woke up
at some point and fought back.

724
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,688
She get a piece of him?
Nothing under her nails.

725
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,986
No fluids or foreign hairs
on the body.

726
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,856
But I did find
something interesting.

727
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,523
Excised the skin
right down to the fascia.
He got a piece of her.

728
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,860
So now he's
collecting trophies?

729
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:13,063
I thought so at first,
but Iook at the size
and Iocation of the wound.

730
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,764
She was fighting him off.

731
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,897
So he bit her.

732
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,033
Then he cuts away the skin
to get rid of the evidence.

733
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,668
Guy's becoming
a regular criminal genius.

734
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,474
Not quite. He didn't
cut deep enough.

735
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,447
There's still an impression
in the muscle tissue.

736
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,710
BENSON: Well, can you match it
to Gardner's dental records?

737
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:31,084
AIready did. No question.
We got the son of a bitch.

738
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,782
Still think your client's
an innocent man?

739
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,659
This is no Ionger a case
of mistaken identities
or false Iine-ups.

740
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,163
This man is guilty
of rape and murder.

741
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,529
If I knew where he was
I'd tell you.

742
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,931
People are in
imminent danger here.

743
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,628
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

744
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,371
If I hear from him, you're
the first call I'II make.

745
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,607
If he's getting any help,
it's not from a family member.

746
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,307
Gardner's got
no relatives in New York.

747
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,178
We talked to his
business partners
and his staff.

748
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,376
Nobody's heard from him.

749
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,112
The wife seemed pretty
devastated when he Ieft.

750
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,517
I don't think
she's hiding him.

751
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,919
Dump his phones,
the Iast six months.

752
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,753
If it was a wrong number,
I want to know what
the conversation was.

753
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,087
Gardner's financials.

754
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,128
AII of the money
belongs to Mrs. Gardner,

755
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,719
but he's got access
to everything.

756
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,924
Any recent transactions?
Yep, a big one.

757
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,364
Five grand
yesterday morning.

758
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,902
Check cashing place
in the Bronx.

759
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,569
MAN: Yeah,
that's the Richie Rich.

760
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,368
He wanted to cash 20 grand.

761
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,966
I told him five was my Iimit.
He wrote up a new check.

762
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,305
STABLER: He alone?

763
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,505
I guess so.
I didn't see anybody.

764
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,172
We're gonna need
the paperwork on that.

765
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,616
The guy had the proper ID.
I didn't do nothing illegal.

766
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,880
Hey, are those recording?

767
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,320
This kind of business?
You better believe it, Iady.

768
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,483
We're gonna
need the tapes.

769
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,750
BENSON: Right there.

770
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,694
MORALES: That your guy?
STABLER: Yep.

771
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,664
It doesn't tell us much
other than he's alone.

772
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,668
I digitized the tape
from the other camera, too.

773
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,330
Here's the same timeframe.

774
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,738
That's him exiting
and getting into
that white SUV.

775
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,709
Like the one Carrie saw
the night of her attack.
Did you get plates off that?

776
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,541
MORALES: Not the way
the camera's positioned.

777
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,606
AII the Accident Investigation
Unit could tell me was
it's a '99 Lexus RX 300.

778
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,015
Can you play that
a Iittle Ionger?

779
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,484
Sure.

780
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,882
Now, he's getting into
the passenger side.
Who's driving?

781
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,187
Let's see if
I can blow it up.

782
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,590
MORALES: We'II go
frame by frame.

783
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,628
Looks Iike
he's kissing her.

784
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,697
His wife's got Iong hair.

785
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,300
Gardner's got himself
a girlfriend.

786
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,008
Any ID on the mystery woman?

787
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,672
We got six months
of phone records.

788
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,215
There's nothing
out of the ordinary yet.

789
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,080
The problem is,
this guy is smart enough

790
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,518
to never have
called the girlfriend
from his own phone.

791
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,815
And if he bought
a pre-paid cell,

792
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:45,947
well, we wouldn't
know about that.

793
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,354
The majority of
the calls this month

794
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,586
went to his Iawyer.
Big surprise.

795
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,362
Last month, too.

796
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,457
And four months ago.

797
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,728
Why would he need to talk
to a criminal defense attorney

798
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,167
before he was arrested?

799
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,570
Because he's been having
an affair with Erin Russ.

800
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,877
She registered a vehicle
to the DMV four years ago.
1999 white Lexus.

801
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,187
STABLER: Look at this.

802
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,504
Erin, it's Detectives
Benson and Stabler.
Let us in.

803
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,940
ERIN: It's open.

804
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,973
Erin, where is he?

805
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,076
Where's Gardner, Erin?

806
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,211
Where is he?

807
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,311
ERIN: He's here.

808
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,222
Let me see your hands.
Put up your hands.

809
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,866
BENSON: Are you hurt?

810
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:05,993
No.

811
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,602
I found the murder weapon
in the car.

812
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,770
He denied it, even after
I found everything.

813
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,006
If he attacked you, there's
nothing you could have done.

814
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,079
That's right.

815
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,987
Justifiable homicide.

816
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,155
If he attacked me.

817
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,432
I need to know it's over.

818
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,367
I tried setting it up
with the people in charge.

819
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,167
They said it was
inappropriate.

820
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,263
How did you convince them?

821
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,638
They don't need to know.
