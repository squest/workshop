1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,832
sexually based offenses are
considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,170
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

4
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,971
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,605
are members of an elite squad
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,376
These are their stories.

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,016
Hi, we're Iooking
for a patient,
Stephanie Rawley?

8
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,213
BENSON: Hey!

9
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,448
We don't have her.

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,047
STABLER: You sure?
She's a rape victim.

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,558
I haven't had
one all night.

12
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,493
Call came from
this hospital,
just got it.

13
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,927
Well, maybe you
mixed up hospitals.

14
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,828
Maybe you could
check the computer.

15
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,062
Oh, well,
here's your miscom.

16
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,502
She's not in emergency.
She's in the ICU.

17
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,538
Good God.

18
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,372
What'd this guy
do to her?

19
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,139
Put her on
Iife support.

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,741
Beautiful girl.

21
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,148
He didn't touch that.
There's not
a mark on her face.

22
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:55,915
BENSON: No defense wounds,
either.

23
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,388
STABLER: BIitz attack
from behind?

24
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,416
Knifepoint to the throat?

25
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,084
STABLER: Let's
check her chart.

26
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,560
She has pneumonia.

27
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,093
But she's out
of the woods.

28
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,065
We brought the fever
down with antibiotics.

29
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,566
Somebody called in a rape.

30
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,796
That was me.
I'm Dr. Sedaly.

31
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,063
She was transferred here
from Mountcastle Rehab.

32
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,437
Drug overdose?

33
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:16,839
No, she was in
a car accident.

34
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,775
BENSON: When?
About a year ago.

35
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,905
She's been in
a persistent vegetative
state ever since.

36
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,576
Okay, she's been in a coma.
I don't understand why you
called us.

37
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,950
Because of the pneumonia,
I ordered a chest X-ray

38
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,455
and the Iab automatically
ran the standard tests.

39
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,683
Hers turned up positive.

40
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,986
For what?

41
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,823
A baby.
She's six weeks pregnant.

42
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,376
My daughter
was raped?

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,644
We should have
kept her at home.

44
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,686
I told you I could
take care of her.

45
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,812
Prayer wasn't going
to bring her back,
Janice.

46
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,516
Mountcastle was
our Iast hope.

47
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,818
How could they
Iet this happen?

48
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,154
I promise you,
we're going to find out.

49
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,252
Was Stephanie moved from
rehab for any reason,
say six, seven weeks ago?

50
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,523
No.

51
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,831
Check all of
Mountcastle's employees.
Anyone who had access.

52
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,496
Don't bother.
I know who did this.

53
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,765
Who?

54
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,967
It couldn't have been David,
he still has
a restraining order.

55
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,134
BENSON: Who's David?

56
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,576
The man Stephanie
was Iiving with.

57
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,079
The wreck was his fault.

58
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,944
Why is there
a restraining order?

59
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,008
After she went
into Mountcastle,
he tried to kill her.

60
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,151
I never tried to kill her.
I only told them her wishes.

61
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,352
Death wishes?

62
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,725
We Iived together for
six years. Yeah, we talked
about everything.

63
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,457
Stephanie never wanted
to Iive Iike this.

64
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,192
FIN: Ma and Pa catch you
tripping over the plug?

65
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,632
No, but they convinced
a judge I might.

66
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,234
I Iove her more than
anything in the world.

67
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,739
Really? How's your
sex Iife been Iately?

68
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,672
None of your business.
It is now.

69
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,845
If you two think...

70
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,746
You two are sick.

71
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,351
Besides, I haven't
seen her in months.

72
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,116
Call me a hopeless romantic,
but I don't see
a Iittle court order

73
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,657
standing in the way
of your undying Iove.

74
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,060
You don't know
her parents.

75
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,592
If it wasn't for them,
I'd have been there to
protect her from that pervert.

76
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:56,032
You blame them, even though
you're the one that put her
in a vegetable crisper?

77
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,133
It was my bachelor party.

78
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,278
The guys dragged me
off to a strip club
in Port Chester.

79
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,781
My friends got smashed,
so I called her
to come get me.

80
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,612
She drives out there,
you being a man,

81
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,482
had to take the wheel,
even though you'd had a few.

82
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,044
She never showed up.

83
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,217
She got hit by
a truck on the way.

84
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,728
MUNCH: He came across
pretty straight up.

85
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,788
FIN: We're not completely
ruling him out, but we're
thinking an inside job.

86
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,300
That's a big place.
Benson and Stabler
could use some help.

87
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,428
They're interviewing
the coma wing staff now.

88
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,870
I don't even want to think
how under-reported
coma rape is.

89
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,874
CRAGEN: Well, victims
don't tend to come forward.

90
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,910
Counselor, question.

91
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:41,276
What would it take
to blanket DNA
an entire facility?

92
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,008
A constitutional amendment.

93
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,277
But we know
the rape happened there.

94
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,286
It doesn't cover
probable cause for
each individual employee.

95
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,686
Not to mention patients,
vendors, visitors...

96
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,952
I mean, where would
your genetic dragnet end?

97
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,220
Whose side
are you on?

98
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,921
What about that
case in Germany?

99
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,120
11-year-old girl
was raped and killed,

100
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,791
they tested everybody
in the town.
Over 16,000 men.

101
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,767
But it was on
a strictly
volunteer basis.

102
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,063
I'II take volunteers.

103
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,106
It's still cost-prohibitive.
It's $600 a pop.

104
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,607
Who says they're all
gonna be processed?

105
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,304
I say we get
everybody's DNA now
while we've got 'em,

106
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,676
we can narrow down
the suspects Iater.

107
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,178
I gave your tech
a separate Iist of everyone
working six weeks ago,

108
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,586
including swing, graveyard
and weekend shifts.

109
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,181
We'II need to start
with the men who worked
directly with Stephanie.

110
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,717
At this point,
she's basically
receiving supportive care,

111
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,526
turned to prevent bedsores,
change IV tubes.

112
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,663
Mostly female nurses.

113
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,626
Except for CIark Jensen,
her physical therapist.

114
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,796
That should
make it easy.

115
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,965
Oh, and her neurologist,
Dr. Mandell.
He's her primary.

116
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,167
And where can
we find him?

117
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,573
He's with a patient.

118
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,042
STABLER: Catch you
at a bad time?

119
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,348
Not at all.
I'm just doing an LP.

120
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,952
Is that a
spinal tap?

121
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,923
She's having
unexplained
seizures

122
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,686
and since she can't
fill in the blanks,

123
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,058
I need to find out
what's going on.

124
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,659
Don't you normally
have a nurse present?

125
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,098
I'm an old hand at this.

126
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,794
STABLER: I meant
as a chaperone.

127
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,370
That policy isn't
for the patient,

128
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,101
it's to protect the doctor
from false allegations.

129
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,234
She can't make any.

130
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,211
Neither can
Stephanie Rawley.

131
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,105
And she has
a Iegitimate one.

132
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,879
Yeah, I can't tell you
how upset I was to hear that.

133
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,544
You examine her alone?

134
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,888
Often.

135
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,826
Stephanie's parents insist
that I repeat every test,

136
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,793
hoping there'II be
a change in her condition.

137
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,454
And what's
her prognosis?

138
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,931
Oh, it's very grim.
She's suffered
massive cortical damage.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,628
She has minimal
brain stem activity.

140
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,194
She has no intellectual
or motor function.

141
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,097
STABLER: Sounds Iike you
spent a Iot of time with her.

142
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,575
I spend time with
all my coma patients.

143
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,874
Would you have any problem
volunteering your DNA?

144
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,873
Not at all.

145
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,212
FIN: CIark Jensen?
Yes?

146
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,253
You do these exercises
with Stephanie Rawley?

147
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,087
Three times a week,
to keep the joints fluid and
the muscles from atrophying.

148
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,923
She's hooked to Iife support.
You roll those machines
up here?

149
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,988
I have a special routine
for the coma patients.
I can do them in their beds.

150
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,327
You don't say.

151
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,299
Two-minute break,
Mr. Crowe.

152
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,006
You happen to hear about
the voluntary DNA test?

153
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,505
I was the first in Iine.

154
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,375
You work with Stephanie a Iot.
Who do you think did it?

155
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,471
I don't know.

156
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,709
But I can't believe one
of my co-workers is a rapist.

157
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,410
What about a patient?
Or visitors.

158
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,043
You ever see this guy?

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,246
(SIGHS)

160
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,255
When?
Month or so ago.

161
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,791
I came in early one morning,
he was with her.

162
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,828
I knew the deal,
but when he told me
his side, I felt for the guy.

163
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,260
Didn't report it, though.

164
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,195
What exactly was he doing
when you walked in?

165
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,634
SIeeping in her bed.

166
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,604
You Iied to us,
Mr. Andersen.

167
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,768
I had to.

168
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,139
The second the Rawleys
find out I broke
the restraining order,

169
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,269
they'II have me arrested.

170
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,609
You Iooked me
right in the eye
and had the violins going...

171
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,172
I stayed away as Iong as
I could, then I started
visiting once a month.

172
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,514
Guess we all know
what you brought her
instead of flowers.

173
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,678
You're wrong.

174
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,120
How'd you manage
to sneak in there?

175
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,486
There's a nurse
on night shift.

176
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,286
She feels bad for me,
she Iooks the other way.

177
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,089
So you get to spend the night
with her in the moonlight,
just Iike old times, huh?

178
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,323
Naturally,
it got hot and heavy.

179
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,931
She gets agitated
at night.

180
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,962
She shakes,
her face twitches.

181
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,165
What do you do
about it, David?
I just hold her.

182
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,375
The doctors say
that she's not aware,

183
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,842
but it seems to
calm her down.

184
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,641
So you'd have no objections
then, to taking a paternity
test, huh?

185
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,738
None.

186
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,214
I want to know who did this
to her as much as you do.

187
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,212
BENSON: So far nobody has
a clue or has any problem
giving up their DNA.

188
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,690
FIN: Including the fiancé,
who was at
the top of our Iist.

189
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,817
Still headlining mine.

190
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,522
I think he's so Iovesick
he doesn't care whether
he goes to jail or not.

191
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,257
If that's the case,
why not just admit it?

192
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,696
Cause he's freaky sick.

193
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,291
I don't know.
They were gonna be
married in one week's time.

194
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,927
BENSON: Come on,
Iike that makes
a difference?

195
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,699
If she didn't give consent,
it's still rape.

196
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,296
I'm saying she would've
if she could've.

197
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,864
Fiancé, best case scenario.

198
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,775
It's not Iike she's facing
psychological trauma
over this. She's produce.

199
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,210
Mrs. Rawley.

200
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,942
Try to stay calm,
we're gonna be right there.

201
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,284
Mrs. Rawley went to mass
and when she came back,
Stephanie was gone.

202
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,378
Where is she?

203
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,583
Nurse said she'd been
transferred back to
the rehab center.

204
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,524
Why would they send her back
to where she was raped?

205
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,185
Where is she?
Look...

206
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,128
Tell me where she is!

207
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,723
STABLER: Mrs. Rawley,
Iet us handle this.

208
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,099
I want to see my daughter.
Right now.

209
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,138
I don't understand
what the problem is.

210
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,604
Was Stephanie
readmitted?

211
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,902
Yes, a few hours ago.

212
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,909
Don't tell me you put
her in the same room.

213
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,741
Well, yes,
but she isn't
there now.

214
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,542
Well, where is she?
The procedure room.

215
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,673
For what?

216
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,377
You're gonna have
to talk to Dr. Mandell,
he's the one who ordered it.

217
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,352
Ordered what?
What is he doing to her?

218
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,413
Mrs. Rawley,
do us a favor
and stay here.

219
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,987
BENSON: Dr. Mandell,
can we have
a word with you?

220
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,590
Hey, this is a sterile field.
Get out of here.

221
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,362
Who the hell are you?

222
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,063
Dr. Garrison.

223
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,729
Now, would you
please get out?

224
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,797
As soon as you tell us
what's going on here.

225
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,808
Just a routine procedure.

226
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,776
Dr. Mandell called me in.

227
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,646
To do what exactly?

228
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,938
Terminate the pregnancy.

229
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,523
I understand you just
interfered with
a medical emergency.

230
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,752
BENSON: What's that,
doc-talk for cover-up?

231
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,352
What are you
talking about?

232
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,659
You tried to destroy
evidence in a rape case
in which you're a suspect.

233
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,393
No wonder you were so willing
to give up your DNA.

234
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,935
You knew you could fix it
so there'd be
nothing to compare it to.

235
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,461
Look, all I knew was
that Stephanie Rawley's
Iife was in danger.

236
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,099
It's funny how the docs
at Wheaton Memorial
seemed to miss that.

237
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:47,339
Yes, well, they're not
experts in the care of
the profoundly devastated.

238
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
So you decide
to play God.

239
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,041
No, I called in
Dr. Garrison,

240
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,554
who agreed that it would
be malpractice to allow
the pregnancy to continue.

241
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,747
How very noble of you.

242
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,222
Except for the fact
that you failed to get
the parents' consent.

243
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,889
It's right here.
STABLER: That's crap.

244
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,296
Mrs. Rawley came to us,
hysterical, when she found out

245
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,799
Stephanie was
brought back here.

246
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,364
I dealt with Mr. Rawley.

247
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,306
I didn't know
what else to do.

248
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,304
I knew you'd
never consent.

249
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,570
Of course I wouldn't.

250
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,374
A sick pervert
raped our daughter.

251
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,608
I wanted that
monster out of her.

252
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,174
Was it Dr. Mandell's
idea or was it yours?

253
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:33,455
He called and told me
the risks of continuing
the pregnancy.

254
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,652
After all this,

255
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,598
I couldn't Iose
my daughter.

256
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,635
An abortion goes
against everything
that we believe in.

257
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,830
This is different.
It's Stephanie.

258
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,666
Do you want to raise
that thing inside her?

259
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,868
That thing is
our grandchild.

260
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,210
Why don't we
talk over here.

261
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,052
I'm a father, too.

262
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,422
What would you do?

263
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,721
I don't know.

264
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,498
I come visit every day
on my Iunch break.

265
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,358
With Mrs. Rawley?
No, alone.

266
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,496
What are you saying?

267
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,340
I'm sorry to
have to say this,
it's standard procedure,

268
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,904
but I should
get a DNA sample.

269
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,108
Robert!

270
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,909
You just assaulted
a police officer.

271
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,284
It's your call.

272
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,622
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

273
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,631
Questioning the father
as a suspect is never
a crowd-pleaser.

274
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,967
Verbal vitriol you'd expect,
anyone else think the father
protests a bit too much?

275
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,027
You're not a father.

276
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,904
You don't have a raped
daughter in a coma with
a devil cake in the oven.

277
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,375
That you just
tried to abort.

278
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,605
Well, we'II know if
it's Dad soon enough.

279
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,670
When do we get the products
of conception for testing?

280
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,511
STABLER: We don't.
They're keeping it.
FIN: Why?

281
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,845
Wife's Catholic.

282
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,478
Still, I've never had
a keeper with a stranger
rape before.

283
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,022
John, OIivia's mother
was raped by a stranger.

284
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,785
My mother
made a choice.

285
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:14,917
Look, OIivia,
we were just talking...

286
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,154
No, save it.

287
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,820
If the same thing
happened to me,

288
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,092
morning-after pill,
no question.

289
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,724
BENSON: So where
are we on the case?

290
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,099
No abortion,
no fetal tissue.
We're screwed.

291
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,661
We'II just have to
wait a couple of months
to start paternity tests.

292
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,400
Until then,
we'II work it
without DNA.

293
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,169
Where are we with
the rehab employees?

294
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,040
We ruled out a handful
with verifiable
medical reasons.

295
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,945
And we interviewed
everybody on the Iist
that volunteered their DNA.

296
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,983
I'm more interested
in anybody who refused.

297
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,608
That would be
two employees.

298
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,983
Okay, Iet's split up
and find out why.

299
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,752
SAMUEL: I know the drill.

300
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,385
Somebody committed a crime,
so Iet's check out
the black guy.

301
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,688
That stinks of
racial profiling.

302
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,956
We're Iooking
at everyone.

303
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,930
Where's your
probable cause?

304
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,556
What about a
search warrant?

305
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,329
This flies in the face
of the Fourth Amendment.

306
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,070
Mr. Hill, supplying
your DNA is voluntary.

307
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,538
No, it's not.

308
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,167
If you decide
not to volunteer,
you're presumed guilty.

309
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,870
I guess you're right.
So just ante up.

310
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,311
Hold on.
Mr. Hill has
a valid point.

311
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:13,348
Our Iikes, dislikes
and habits are all stored
in huge computer systems.

312
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,788
On top of that, you got
facial recognition technology,
public video surveillance.

313
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,916
National ID cards.
Where does it end?

314
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,983
Every piece of data
you put out there,

315
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,962
exponentially increases
the control The Man
wields over us.

316
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,261
I can see you understand
why this conversation
ends here.

317
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,596
Good day to you both.

318
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,331
Mr. Hill, if you didn't
rape Stephanie Rawley,
DNA can only exclude you.

319
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,838
We're off your back.

320
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,101
No.

321
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,943
Fascist pig.

322
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,373
What the hell was that?

323
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,410
Good police work.
Here's your DNA.

324
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,677
Well, what if I have a fatal
illness or something? Then I'd
know. I don't want to know.

325
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,484
We won't be testing
for any diseases.

326
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,025
But what if someone
gets ahold of the test,

327
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,061
finds out that I
do have a disease,
then denies me insurance?

328
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,425
I can't make all
those medical bills.

329
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,157
I assure you,
no one outside
the police department

330
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,528
will have access
to your DNA.

331
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,760
Once you exclude yourself,
it's destroyed.

332
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,799
Okay. AII right.

333
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,369
Well, what if I've committed
some crime in the past, huh?

334
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,341
Can you arrest me,
once you get ahold
of my DNA?

335
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,537
Have you committed
another crime?

336
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,045
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

337
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,606
No. But, you know.
Guys...

338
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,810
They make mistakes
all the time,

339
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,944
guys go to prison for years
before they figure it out.

340
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,185
Mr. Baltzer, if you don't
clear yourself, we're gonna
have to start digging around.

341
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,953
Why?
And asking questions.

342
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,392
Why?
Look, you had
access to the victim.

343
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,793
You were here alone,
at night, no witnesses.

344
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,388
No, no,
that's not true.

345
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,955
I am not here alone,
I swear.

346
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,228
There are a Iot of people
who wander these halls.

347
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,462
Like?

348
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,504
Like the vending guys,
the delivery men.

349
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,436
The fellow who
picks up the...

350
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,700
Picks up the what?

351
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,005
You know,

352
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,112
from the morgue.
The stiffs.

353
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,313
I get hungry.

354
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,583
The vending machines upstairs
have better selections.

355
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,353
Well, how do they compare
with the snacks in, say,
the coma wing?

356
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,418
I don't know.
I don't go there.

357
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,293
Oh, come on.
AII those nights
you've roamed the halls

358
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,698
jonesing for a Ding Dong fix,
you never once checked out
the coma wing?

359
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,201
What are you getting at?

360
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,865
Wesley, we're collecting DNA
from everyone who has contact
with the rehab.

361
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,805
We'd appreciate
your contribution.

362
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,502
No. No, I don't think so.

363
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,670
STABLER: Why not,
what's to hide?

364
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,477
I know how you cops operate.
You get a case,
you can't solve it,

365
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,781
you plant evidence,
make Wesley your fall guy.

366
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,185
Sounds Iike you've
had a run-in or two
with the police.

367
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,586
I don't have a record.

368
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,524
No, but we did find
a dropped complaint
against you.

369
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,890
Maxine Hatters?

370
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,487
Who the hell is that?

371
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,622
The woman you
assaulted a year ago.

372
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,222
The woman you
tried to choke.

373
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,226
She called the police?

374
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,166
She's Iucky I didn't
have her arrested.

375
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,869
You attacked her.
Why would you be
the one to press charges?

376
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,140
Because she
stole my wallet.

377
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,640
I only took it so
I could turn him in.

378
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,412
Creep tried
to strangle me.

379
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,113
That's a serious charge.
Why drop it?

380
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,087
I didn't Iike the way
I was being treated.

381
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,125
I tried to tell my story
and your boys in blue
put it back on me.

382
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,319
You want to tell us,
we'II Iisten.

383
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,160
So, I'm sitting in
this chicken joint,
Iike, 3:00 a.m.

384
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,429
This guy comes over,
starts asking me
about the chicken.

385
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,134
The chicken.
MAXINE: Yeah.

386
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,364
He offers to buy me some.
Some chicken?

387
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,237
Yeah. Only when we
get up to the motel
room to eat it...

388
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,900
Maxine, the guy's a john.

389
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,878
You're all alike. I'm a pro,
so it doesn't matter
he tried to kill me.

390
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,541
We don't care about your
night job, we're just trying
to get the story straight.

391
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:36,048
So we get up to
the motel room,
I ask him how he wants it,

392
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:40,182
I'm supposed to strip naked,
Iie flat on my back, not move
a muscle, not say a sound.

393
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,886
You got a problem
with that?
No.

394
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,924
He's the one who
had a Iittle problem,
if you know what I mean.

395
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,931
Okay, so you Iaughed at him,
he chokes you.

396
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,867
No, I was very understanding,
till he started
filling the tub with ice.

397
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:51,960
For what?

398
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,336
He told me to Iie in it.
I'm Iike, "No way."
That's when he chokes me.

399
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,671
He was trying to Iower
your body temperature.

400
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,269
Said he couldn't do it
unless I really seemed dead.

401
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,511
BENSON: You gotta
be kidding me.

402
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,715
Wesley, what is this thing
with you, water and women?

403
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,888
I'm just doing my job.

404
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,086
I mean, the hot showers I get,
but ice baths?

405
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,560
We tracked down Maxine.

406
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,088
Your old prostitute.

407
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,463
The one you hired
to pretend to be
pretty much Iike her.

408
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,092
I heard you
weren't real happy
with her performance.

409
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,137
How'd Stephanie Rawley do?

410
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,833
I told you, I've never
been to the coma wing.

411
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,303
Could you please go?
You're gonna get me fired.

412
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,639
Oh, we wouldn't
want to do that,

413
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,873
seeing as you've
only been here for,
what, a couple of months?

414
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,382
Before that you were at

415
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,514
Upson Funeral Home.

416
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,579
What went wrong there?

417
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,816
Nothing.

418
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,894
No, Wesley was great.
It was just time
for him to move on.

419
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,260
After seven weeks.

420
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,491
Yes.

421
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,159
Uh-huh.

422
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,794
Ma'am, just so you know,
the Federal Trade Commission

423
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,738
no Ionger requires you
to buy your casket
at the funeral home.

424
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,275
You can save a few thousand
by buying from the supplier.

425
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:08,177
Not when you take into account
the discount package I'II be
offering you.

426
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,408
I'II be right back
to discuss that.

427
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,782
I assume you gave
her the price Iist,
as required by Iaw?

428
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,412
AII right.
We had some thefts.

429
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,982
Some jewelry,
a few gold fillings,
so we installed a camera.

430
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,118
We're not here
about grave robbing.

431
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,095
Well, Wesley wasn't
our thief.

432
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,397
But I'm afraid we
did catch him on tape.

433
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,933
Doing what?

434
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,964
The Iate Mrs. Thurgeston.

435
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,466
Kind of Iate to be
paying your respects,
isn't it?

436
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,271
STABLER: Guess
you two were close.

437
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,370
Really close.

438
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,673
You Iike
the quiet type, huh?

439
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,646
PIease turn it off.

440
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,082
Oh, relax,
it's over in a second.

441
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,386
Ah, but I guess I don't
have to tell you that.

442
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,150
WESLEY: Can I please
have a glass of water?

443
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,851
(KNOCKING)
BENSON: Heavy on the ice,
right?

444
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,329
BENSON: He's got dry mouth.

445
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,763
At Ieast we're
making him nervous.

446
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,629
HUANG: Yeah,
you more than EIIiot.

447
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,499
He's a necrophiliac.
His greatest fear
is to be judged by women.

448
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,632
The emasculation
tactic might not be
the way to go on this one.

449
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,834
That's why we
pulled you out.

450
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:11,967
What are you
thinking?

451
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,012
Shame is driving
his compulsion.

452
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,411
He was most Iikely
raised in an overly
religious household,

453
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,915
where an intense
degree of shame
was attached to sex.

454
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,817
So what are we thinking?
Empathize?

455
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,218
Tell him that
we understand?

456
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,820
I doubt that
he understands.

457
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,254
Pretty girl, isn't she?

458
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,423
I guess.

459
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,861
AImost Iike SIeeping Beauty
and she's been
in a coma for a year.

460
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,135
Look, I've never
seen her before.

461
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,673
Come on, Wesley,
I understand.
I'm a guy.

462
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,536
Hard opportunity to pass up.

463
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,078
It's not Iike she
knew what was going on.

464
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,203
You don't understand.

465
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,578
I do, more than you think.
It's what every guy wants.

466
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,580
No one judging you...

467
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,542
Right.

468
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,384
Just Stephanie
Iying there perfect.
Deaf, dumb and blind.

469
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,889
No, it doesn't
work that way.

470
00:20:58,957 --> 00:20:59,981
Why doesn't it
work that way?

471
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,491
She's alive.
Come on!

472
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,892
Don't split hairs with me,
Wesley! Come on!

473
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,862
People snap out of
comas all the time.

474
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,627
Well, what about the hooker
that you hired, huh?

475
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,361
She was alive
and kicking, pal.

476
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,666
And I bet she told you
what a miserable failure
I was.

477
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,264
Yes, she did.
And we had a big
Iaugh at your expense.

478
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,499
I knew she'd talk.

479
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,010
(SNIFFING)

480
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,342
You can't trust
a woman with a pulse.

481
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,678
CRAGEN: Get him his water.

482
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:30,188
Okay, but I don't see
this guy giving it up,
whether I'm in there or not.

483
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,054
HUANG: What if there's
nothing to give up?

484
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,115
Obviously we weren't
watching the same tape.

485
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,161
I'm just saying,
there are some extreme
cases where a necrophiliac

486
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,595
can't sustain the arousal
required to penetrate,

487
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,656
Iet alone impregnate,
a warm body.

488
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,526
So, you don't
need me after all.

489
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,626
No, hold on.

490
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,001
The only thing
rendering Mr. Dilbert Iimp

491
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,599
is the 12-to-25 he's facing
on rape one as opposed to...

492
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,303
What does
necrophilia get him?

493
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,571
Sexual misconduct.

494
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,738
A misdemeanor.
Great. One year, max.

495
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,839
CABOT: Is there anything
that Iinks him to Stephanie?

496
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,009
Any witnesses,
physical evidence?

497
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,349
We'II have paternity
in two months.

498
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,356
Well, at the very Ieast,
Iet's save the Iate
Mrs. Thurgeston

499
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,085
another spin in her grave.

500
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,161
We'II charge him
with necrophilia,
get him off the street.

501

"Docket number 269501.
People vs. Dilbert.

"Sexual misconduct
130.20 sub 3."

503
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,598
Sub 3?

00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,165
Which one is it, Counselor?

505
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,679
Was the sexual conduct
with an animal or
a dead human body?

506
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,409
Mr. Dilbert is a funeral home
attendant who was videotaped

507
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,610
having sex with
a human corpse.

508
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,283
COHEN: Your plea, Mr. Dilbert?

509
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,582
Not guilty, Your Honor.

510
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,020
I'II hear from
the People on bail.

511
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,182
$100,000.

512
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,747
COHEN: For an A misdemeanor?

513
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,953
CABOT: He has insufficient
community ties,

514
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,792
poses an ongoing threat,
and, we believe,
is a flight risk.

515
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,833
He has Iimited
financial means,
no criminal record,

516
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,630
and given
the non-violent crime
he's been charged with,

517
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,534
I see no threat
to the community.

518
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,971
Your honor, Mr. Dilbert
is the number-one suspect

519
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,736
in the rape of
a comatose patient.

520
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,300
We believe this heightens
the flight risk considerably.

521
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,177
I'm sorry, I don't see
an indictment on that charge.

522
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,340
You will.

523
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,443
Until I do, His Honor
cannot possibly consider
it in determining bail.

524
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,112
Request ROR.

525
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,785
Bail's set at $5,000.

526
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,824
So he'II be
out by morning.

527
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,328
Free to ruin
someone else's
daughter.

528
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,524
Why couldn't you charge him
with Stephanie's rape?

529
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,294
We don't have enough
evidence to support it yet.

530
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,595
Mr. RAWLEY: When will you?

531
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,136
We need the fetus' DNA
to determine paternity.

532
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,934
The earliest an amnio
can be done is 14 weeks.

533
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,474
That's almost two months.

534
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,772
They could have it now
if they had the tissue.

535
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,209
That's not an option.

536
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,770
HUANG: You know,
I may have one for you.

537
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,543
Dr. Huang is familiar
with the case.

538
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,347
With amniocentesis,
as with chorionic
villus sampling,

539
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,684
there's always
a chance of miscarriage
or other complications.

540
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,813
Oh, my God.

541
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,051
HUANG: That's why they've
been experimenting
with alternative testing.

542
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,026
A colleague of mine,
a forensic gynecologist,
has been successful

543
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,496
in adapting the alternative
to determine early prenatal
paternity.

544
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,431
BENSON: So what did
you get for us?

545
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,700
Well, we took 30 cc
of Stephanie's blood

546
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,141
and we subjected it to density
gradient centrifugation

547
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,236
to remove the maternal
non-nucleated
red blood cells.

548
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,337
HUANG: Leaving you only
with the fetal cells.

549
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,403
So, did it work?

550
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,780
Well, mind you,
even during
the optimal period,

551
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,412
the frequency of fetal cells
in maternal blood is
only one in ten million.

552
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,423
Luckily, we have this
high-precision magnetic
cell-separation technology.

553
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,425
BENSON: So, did it
work or not?
Yes.

554
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,121
Did you compare it to Wesley
the Necro's DNA sample?

555
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,562
There was no need.
The fetus' blood type is AB.

556
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,360
The mother's is type A,
which means...

557
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,661
The father can
only be type B.

558
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,794
And Wesley is type A.
So, he cannot be the father.

559
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,099
That's right.

560
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,230
Damn it.

561
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,673
We have those other
volunteered samples to run.
How many are type B?

562
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:41,508
Well, not the fiancé,
not Mr. Riley,

563
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,476
not the night custodian,

564
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,208
not him...

565
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,012
Hello.

566
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,679
Look who we have here.

567
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,993
Do you have any idea how many
people have type B blood?

568
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,120
One in ten.
We did our homework.

569
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,426
And you're the only
one who had type B

570
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,933
and had access
and tried to
abort the evidence.

571
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,936
Doc, you just keep
popping up on our
radar screen.

572
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,301
Now what are we
supposed to think?

573
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,602
Well, fortunately,
you don't have to.

574
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:15,078
Modern technology has removed
that burden. You have my DNA,
just run it.

575
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,773
Well, we'II get the results
back in a few days.

576
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,942
The problem is, you make us
wait till then, we're gonna
be in no mood to bargain.

577
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,219
I think I'II
take my chances.

578
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,677
(KNOCKING)

579
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,824
BENSON: Why, Dr. Huang.
What brings you here?

580
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,761
Some fascinating results
from the gynecological
examinations

581
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,391
performed on Dr. Mandell's
other female coma patients.

582
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,935
These are forensic pictures
taken with a culposcope

583
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,870
of the uterine walls
of your patient,
Audrey Logan.

584
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,240
Dr. Mandell,
help us out here.

585
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,038
What's your diagnosis?

586
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,103
I'm not a trained OB/GYN.

587
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,641
Come on,
we all did gynecology
in med school.

588
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,648
Give it a shot.

589
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,822
Well, it Iooks Iike
a healthy uterus, no

590
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,796
signs of endometriosis,
no polyps, no cysts.

591
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,301
Well, it does take
a trained eye, but if
you notice right there,

592
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,165
there's miniscule scarring.

593
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,966
STABLER:
From a sexual assault?

594
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,837
No. I'd say more Iikely
from a recent abortion.

595
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,868
So, you raped her, too.

596
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,676
And got rid of the evidence.

597
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,672
I need to speak
with my attorney.

598
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,917
Doc Mandell took
care of both women.

599
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,323
We know he tried to abort
Stephanie's fetus,
he's not copping to the other.

600
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,123
Well, what do we know
about raped coma victim
number two?

601
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,298
Audrey Logan, captain of her
high school debate team

602
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:45,268
until she went to a rave
three years ago and ingested
one too many party favors.

603
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,362
Yeah, now she's captain
of the drool team.

604
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,667
Fin went to get
her medical records.

605
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,571
What have you
dug up on the doc?

606
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,110
No dirt, per se, yet,
but Iisten to this.

607
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,942
Turns out he works
two days a week
at a place called Diotyne.

608
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,709
Bio-tech company.

609
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,079
What does he
do there?

610
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,709
Parkinson's research.

611
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,412
Well, it make sense.
He's a neurologist.

612
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,385
CRAGEN: Audrey's
medical files?

613
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,424
No record of an abortion
and the only operation

614
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,221
was for an ovarian cyst
removed four months ago.

615
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,194
Time frame fits
with the scarring.

616
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,729
FIN: Guess who the OB/GYN was.

617
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,162
Dr. Garrison.

618
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,598
That's the same woman
Mandell brought in to
abort Stephanie.

619
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,659
I think it's time we
invite her in for a chat.

620
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,102
FIN: Tried, she wasn't
at the hospital.

621
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,934
She works for some
research Iab called...

622
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,406
Diotyne?

623
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,302
How do you know?

624
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,312
Just a crazy hunch.

625
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,876
My relationship with
Dr. Mandell is none
of your business.

626
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,715
He's in a Iot of trouble,
Dr. Garrison.
And he's dragged you into it.

627
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,017
Dr. Mandell hasn't
dragged me into anything.

628
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,088
You're awfully
accommodating.

629
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,952
How's it work?
He rapes 'em,
you scrape 'em?

630
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,620
He's not a rapist.

631
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:49,193
As I explained,
Stephanie's Iife was,
and is, at risk.

632
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,427
BENSON: And what about
Audrey Logan?

633
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,333
You did a good job
removing her cyst.

634
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,038
Didn't even Ieave
a scar on her ovary.

635
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,835
But you did Ieave
one on her uterus.

636
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,637
How do you
explain that?

637
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,811
It's not what you think.

638
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,247
Oh, yeah,
what is it?

639
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,282
Bureaucratic roadblocks.

640
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,945
When Bush Iimited stem cell
research to cell Iines
already established,

641
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,954
he essentially shut
down Graham's work.

642
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,582
What does that have to do
with Stephanie Rawley and
Audrey Logan?

643
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:14,784
Everything.

644
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,922
He Iost his federal
funding and we had
to turn to private sources.

645
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:23,331
Which is Iegal,
but unfortunately
has strings attached.

646
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,062
What are you
talking about?

647
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,468
Do you know who
Davis Langley is?

648
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,870
BENSON: The software magnate?

649
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,102
He put up all the money.

650
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:35,277
I could have stopped him
but this is for
the greater good.

651
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,041
Where's the greater
good in rape?

652
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,283
They weren't raped.

653
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,510
They were inseminated.

654
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,379
Stephanie's parents
signed a blanket consent.

655
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,983
Did it mention
insemination in
the fine print?

656
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,085
It covered
experimental procedures.

657
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,988
I've done everything
conceivable to bring
her out of the coma.

658
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,728
This wasn't for her.
It was for an old,
sick billionaire.

659
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,827
I have done nothing wrong.

660
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,769
I didn't profit
from this in any way.

661
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,239
We'II be checking
your financials.

662
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:07,074
Look, do you have
any idea what Parkinson's
does to a body?

663
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,709
Any idea?

664
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,642
I watched my

665
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,548
father slowly
deteriorate and then
die from the disease.

666
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,918
I couldn't do
a thing to stop it.

667
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,688
Being a doctor,
that must have been
very frustrating for you.

668
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,393
It's why I became
a neurologist.

669
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,766
I didn't want to
see anybody else
suffer the way he did.

670
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,196
(SIGHS)

671
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,910
I was just trying
to help Mr. Langley.

672
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,946
But the hell with
Audrey and Stephanie,
right?

673
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,873
Don't you get it?

674
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,644
Medical advances
have a price.

675
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,918
Now, the first ten
bone marrow transplants
ended in death.

676
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,049
Now if we'd given up,
thousands of people
would have died.

677
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,286
Like they'II go on
dying from Parkinson's

678
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,124
if you stop me
from doing my job.

679
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,857
Don't you get it?

680
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,421
You're going to jail.

681
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,989
I haven't broken
any Iaws.

682
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,331
You impregnated two girls
against their will.

683
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,598
What will?
They barely
have a pulse.

684
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:12,440
Audrey is in no
worse condition now
than she was before.

685
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,105
And I could have said the same
about Stephanie if you hadn't
stopped the procedure.

686
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,478
Oh, so now it's our fault.

687
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,609
AII I needed was a genetic
match for the stem cells

688
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:23,153
to be implanted into
Mr. Langley's brain.

689
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,287
It's still experimental,
but it's his only hope.

690
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,829
SCHOENFELD:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

691
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,032
I'm Milton Schoenfeld,
Mr. Langley's attorney.

692
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,539
Well, since we're whipping
them out, this is AIex Cabot,
Assistant District Attorney.

693
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,711
What can I do for you?

694
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,248
Well, for starters,
you can produce your client.

695
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,546
Anything you have
to say to Mr. Langley,
you can say to me.

696
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,415
If there's anything
of interest,
I'II pass it along.

697
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,612
Of interest?

698
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,747
How about paying a woman
to be forcibly impregnated?

699
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,554
Then conspiring to abort
the fetus and play
Frankenstein with the parts.

700
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,061
Mr. Langley is not a doctor,
although he has consulted

701
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,290
several regarding
his condition.

702
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,768
He can't be held
responsible if any Iaws
were broken by one of them

703
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,166
without his knowledge.

704
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,933
Right, he had no idea why
he was jerking off into a cup.

705
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,942
He's given countless
specimens. BIood,
urine, tissue...

706
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,807
He couldn't tell you
what was done with those,
either.

707
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,212
So he wouldn't have
any trouble testifying
against Dr. Mandell.

708
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,773
I'm afraid his failing
health would prohibit that.

709
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,216
Oh, that's too bad,

710
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,119
because if there's one place
you don't want to be when
you're sick, it's Attica.

711
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,784
My client has done nothing
illegal, so good Iuck getting
an indictment.

712
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,293
Otherwise,
don't bother us again.

713
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,629
AIex. Hey,
how'd it go?

714
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,466
The grand jury
gave me both doctors,
but no-billed Langley.

715
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,472
Did they see
the three million dollar
check he wrote to Diotyne?

716
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,633
As a perfectly
Iegal donation.

717
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,336
That was payment
for stolen goods.

718
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,141
It doesn't even meet
the burden for a felony.

719
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,341
Because it's illegal
to buy and sell body parts,

720
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,611
by Iaw they have
no monetary value.

721
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,846
You mean, I could go to jail
for stealing a toaster,

722
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,946
but not for stealing
a woman's eggs?

723
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,856
Unfortunately,
the Iaw hasn't quite
caught up to the technology.

724
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,518
Well, what if
Dr. Mandell's
theory is right

725
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,688
and the procurement
of genetically matched
stem cells is the answer?

726
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,664
Does that up
the ethical dilemma?

727
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,895
Mandell and Garrison
essentially raped a woman
with a turkey baster.

728
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,437
So, you've got
aggravated sex
abuse one.

729
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,440
Well, that's what I'm
going for, but they're gonna
argue no sexual gratification.

730
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:27,376
Every jury has a mother,
a daughter or a sister.
PIay the emotion card.

731
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,679
CABOT: Mrs. Rawley,
take your time.

732
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,082
MRS. RAWLEY:
Stephanie's been in a coma...

733
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,816
It'II be 14 months
next Tuesday.

734
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,792
And during that time,
has she ever regained
consciousness?

735
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,090
No. She's on Iife support.

736
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,726
Machines constantly
monitor her vital signs,

737
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,932
so there would be a record
if she had ever woken up,
even momentarily?

738
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,772
Oh, yes.
That hasn't happened. Yet.

739
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,941
So there is no way
she could have consented
to being impregnated

740
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:07,815
and then having her fetus
aborted by Dr. Mandell's
experimental procedure.

741
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,443
MRS. RAWLEY: Absolutely not.

742
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,616
And she would never
have agreed to that,
under any circumstances.

743
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,221
Do you ever
visit your daughter?

744
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,857
Every day.

745
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,056
I talk to her, read to her,

746
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,299
when her Iips are chapped, I

747
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,464
put ice chips on them.

748
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,076
But if Stephanie can't
communicate with you,

749
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,773
or with anyone else
for that matter,

750
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,010
why do you put
yourself through it?

751
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,581
Because I know she's still
in there somewhere.

752
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,724
People wake up from
comas all the time,
sometimes after years.

753
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,424
And I'm going to be
there when she does.

754
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,725
Thank you.

755
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,201
Your daughter was
a very pretty girl.

756
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,840
She still is.

757
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,503
LANGAN: Kind person?

758
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,272
Ask anyone who
ever met her.

759
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,115
Sweetest girl
in the world.

760
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,776
What did she
do for a Iiving?

761
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,582
She graduated with honors,
she could've done anything,

762
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,180
but she chose to work with
special needs children.

763
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,588
I have a copy of her
driver's Iicense here.

764
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,761
She was an organ donor?

765
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,864
Yes.

766
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:35,099
She intended to spend
the rest of her Iife,
and after, helping people.

767
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,599
Yes.

768
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,372
LANGAN: So,
would it be
fair to say,

769
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,248
considering her
circumstances,

770
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,977
she might have
chosen to contribute

771
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:50,248
any way she could to help
the suffering of millions?

772
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,050
Stephanie Ioved children.

773
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:57,526
How dare you imply that
she would have created
a Iife just to have it

774
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,996
destroyed by that monster.

775
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,164
We trusted you.

776
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,603
You promised you would do
everything you could for her.

777
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:13,975
Your job was to help
Stephanie, not use her
as a human petrie dish!

778
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,853
LANGAN: What good could
possibly have come from
this experimental procedure?

779
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:27,015
To start with,
the cure of Parkinson's.

780
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,956
From there,
treatment for AIzheimer's,

781
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,223
spinal cord injuries,
heart disease, diabetes.

782
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,161
How?

783
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,500
Well, I'm afraid
it's quite involved.

784
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,131
It's a culmination
of 15 years of my
own research,

785
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:47,940
not to mention
a century of experimentation
by countless others.

786
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,343
In a nutshell?

787
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:55,880
The Holy Grail of
medical research.
Embryonic stem cells.

788
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,650
Now, unlike adult cells,
they have a

789
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,891
pluripotentiality.

790
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,324
In Iayman's terms?

791
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,625
Well, these cells haven't
decided what they're going
to become yet.

792
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:12,795
Meaning we can coax them
to grow into any cell type
we need.

793
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,929
LANGAN: In the case
of Parkinson's?

794
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,909
The brain must produce
dopamine to control
muscle movement.

795
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:25,313
In Parkinson's,
the basal ganglia cells
which produce this chemical

796
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,884
start to degenerate and die.

797
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,554
And it's our hope to
finally replace these
damaged neural cells.

798
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,789
Thank you.

799
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,192
BENSON: Mandell
actually took the stand
in his own defense?

800
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,824
He still doesn't think
he did anything wrong.

801
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,424
So he hung himself.

802
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,299
Not if he reaches
even one juror

803
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,032
whose parent is dying
from Parkinson's
or AIzheimer's.

804
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,836
Well, they have no choice
if you made your case.

805
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,675
He Iost a Iot of ground
when he admitted he tried
to abort Stephanie.

806
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,213
And I still
have my summation.

807
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,976
I'm afraid
there's going to be
a slight delay on that.

808
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,814
Sorry for the Iate notice,
but this witness
just became available.

809
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,148
Who is it?

810
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,255
Well, he was too
sick to testify for us,

811
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,383
but it Iooks Iike
Davis Langley has made

812
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,586
a miraculous recovery
for the defense.

813
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,097
At the start it was
just my right hand.

814
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,930
My hand,
it was ice cold
all the time.

815
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,272
Then, my arm

816
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,973
stopped swinging
when I walked
and that was

817
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,681
six years ago.

818
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,746
Now, I...

819
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,013
I can't even
brush my own teeth.

820
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,424
I can't button
my shirt.

821
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,857
I can't control
my bowels.

822
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:55,668
I piss in this bag,
for God's sake.

823
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,606
I choke on my food.

824
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,943
I'm even afraid to
take a drink of water

825
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:11,183
because usually it
goes down the wrong pipe

826
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:16,422
and causes havoc
in my Iungs.

827
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,719
I've had
pneumonia three times.

828
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,866
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

829
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,902
And why did you choose
to come forward today,
Mr. Langley?

830
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,770
Because they're
prosecuting the wrong man.

831
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:37,606
Dr. Mandell fought
me tooth and nail.

832
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:43,143
He made it perfectly clear
that they had some success

833
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,658
with animal trials but they
were years away from humans.

834
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,754
LANGAN: Why would you
put yourself at risk?

835
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:57,134
I haven't got five
more years to wait
for government approval.

836
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:04,002
At this point, I don't think
I've got five months.

837
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,206
Thank you.

838
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,378
Mr. Langley,

839
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,721
were you aware how
Dr. Mandell attempted
to procure stem cells for you?

840
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,886
Actually, it was my idea.

841
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,526
I wasn't aware you
had a medical degree,
Mr. Langley.

842
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,296
I don't,

843
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,864
but I read everything
there is out there
about the subject.

844
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,438
If they could create

845
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:45,671
a picture-perfect
genetically matched cell,

846
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,817
they could up the odds.

847
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:54,288
So, who cares if a comatose
woman is violated in the name
of science?

848
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,451
No, no.

849
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,963
My sympathy
to the family, but

850
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,898
their beautiful daughter
Ieft this earth a year ago.

851
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:10,199
But out of their tragedy
could come a gift of Iife

852
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,169
for many, many others.

853
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:19,612
You have all
the money in the world.
Why not hire a surrogate?

854
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:27,221
Well, it's one thing
to carry a baby
for someone else,

855
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,590
it's quite another
to do what we needed.

856
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:37,397
I couldn't ask any woman
to knowingly carry
that burden.

857
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,664
Mr. Langley, are you aware
that you have just confessed

858
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,174
to being a co-conspirator
in this crime?

859
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,807
Young Iady, Iook at me.

860
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:56,019
Prison couldn't compare
with what I'm facing now.

861
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,355
Even if it's
too Iate for me,

862
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,782
it could end up
helping millions.

863
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,525
I'm willing to
be the guinea pig.

864
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:11,793
PIease, Iet me
make it happen.

865
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,295
PIease.

866
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,316
STABLER: Verdict came in.

867
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,545
BENSON: No.
They did not
Iet 'em off.

868
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,919
SIaps on the wrist.

869
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,289
The only charge
I got a guilty on was
the straight battery.

870
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,987
They tried to
steal a human fetus.

871
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,792
A guy in Jersey got
10 years for selling
stolen horse sperm.

872
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:44,357
Got no priors,
there's a chance Mandell
won't even see jail time.

873
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,835
There's just no precedent
for this kind of case yet.

874
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,369
Mrs. Rawley, I am so sorry
I could not do more.

875
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,575
You okay?
Can I get you
something?

876
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,311
You have got
to stop him.

877
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,746
Stop who?

878
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:02,149
Davis Langley just filed
for custody of the baby.

879
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,415
He wants to take my
grandchild away from me.

880
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,086
He can't do that, can he?

881
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,824
His attorney says he is
the biological father,

882
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,830
that you just established
that for him in court.

883
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,388
And he says that
biology always wins.

884
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,990
Mrs. Rawley,
Iet's have a seat.

885
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,637
Let's just calm
down for a second,
come on over here.

886
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,264
I don't get it.

887
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,173
Why would Davis Langley
want custody of that baby?

888
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,770
Guilt?

889
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,444
Survival.

890
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:34,742
If he's granted custody,
along with the baby
comes the umbilical cord.

891
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,548
I've cut four of them,
it's not exactly something
you save for the scrapbook.

892
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,613
Cord blood is chock
full of stem cells.

893
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,421
Half of which will be his
perfect genetic match.
