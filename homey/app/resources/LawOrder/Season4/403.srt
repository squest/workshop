NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,932
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,166
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,039
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,773
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,816
These are their stories.

(RUSTLING)

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,496
Armando,
wake up.

9
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,054
What?
Shh. Someone's
in the house.

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,534
Call 91 1.

11
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,470
I can't
find the phone.

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,597
Just get in
the closet.

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,752
(BOTTLES RATTLING)

14
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,201
Is that you, Itsy?

15
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,537
(PANTING)

16
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,508
Who the hell
is Itsy?

17
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,238
Who the hell
is she?

18
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,409
No ID.
Can't tell me
her name.

19
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,576
Can't
or won't?

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,888
I think Granny's only
knitting with one needle,
if you catch my drift.

21
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,890
Well, she came in
through a window, so she was
pretty desperate to get in.

22
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,688
Well, she thinks
she Iives here, apparently
with someone named Itsy.

23
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,887
And you canvassed
the building?

24
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,554
Yeah.
No one knows her.

25
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,597
Yeah, Granny Doe
made herself
right at home.

26
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,963
That's her coat
on the rack.

27
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,592
Okay. Thanks.

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,063
Why are all
these men here?

29
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,665
I'm not decent.

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,469
It's okay, ma'am.

31
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,136
It's okay.

32
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,303
PIease.
Make them Ieave.

33
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,777
AII right.

34
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,014
I'm Detective Benson.
Can you tell me
what happened?

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,515
I have to talk to Itsy.

36
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,183
Okay. Is Itsy the one
that hurt you?

37
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,258
You don't know anything,
do you?

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,530
Just what
Itsy told me.

39
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,126
She promised not to tell.

40
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,996
Well, that's because
she wants you to tell me.

41
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,598
What happened?

42
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,175
He had his way with me.

43
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,547
Who did?

44
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,655
Ma'am, may I?

45
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,467
Did you see that?

46
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,266
Yeah. Someone used her
for an ashtray.

47
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,954
Was she raped?

48
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,683
No abrasions or fluids,
you'II have to wait
for the kit.

49
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,853
But she had 12 raw burns
to her breasts and genitals.

50
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,122
She was in shock
when we talked to her.

51
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,527
You think
she'II remember
more details?

52
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,724
I doubt it.

53
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,996
Her head CT
and MRI are clear,
no sign of infection.

54
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,536
She probably
has AIzheimer's.

55
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,866
So, no short-term memory.

56
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,064
Any way to
kick-start it?

57
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,630
Damage done
is irreversible.
She's in here.

58
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,404
She hasn't been
admitted yet?

59
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,241
No need to.
She has mild
high blood pressure.

60
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:11,374
Nothing more serious.
I gave her Silvadene Iotion
for her burns.

61
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,011
This woman needs
supervised care.

62
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,786
Long-term. We don't provide
that here. I just need
someone to release her to.

63
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,861
Do you feel up to
talking now?

64
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,659
Oh, where's my purse?

65
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,264
Look, what happened
to my purse?

66
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,301
You didn't have one
with you.

67
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,461
Did you take it
when you went out?

68
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,766
Well, I had my purse here
10 minutes ago.
Of course I had my purse.

69
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,500
We'II help you
Iook for it.

70
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,768
Did it have
your name in it?

71
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,173
Of course it had
my name in it.

72
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,870
Okay.
What was the name?

73
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,140
I don't know.
Whatever.

74
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,081
What could have happened
to my purse?

75
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,014
Well, what's it to you?
You took my purse.

76
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,613
You make her
give me back
my purse.

77
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,488
I promise you,
she didn't take
your purse.

78
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,551
Yes, she did. She did take
my purse. Nobody else
could have taken my purse.

79
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,028
You give me back
my purse.

80
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,089
Maybe the person
who hurt you
took your purse?

81
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,968
Were you attacked in
your home? Or someplace else?
Can you remember?

82
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,671
I was in my bedroom.
I was... I was asleep,
and I...

83
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,304
I was asleep in my bedroom
and I...

84
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,144
I woke up and...

85
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,211
He pushed up my nightgown.

86
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,015
He was in there.

87
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,590
Oh, it hurt so bad.

88
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,830
I tried to hit him.
I tried to push him off,

89
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,301
but I couldn't move.

90
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,467
BENSON: Did you know
your attacker?

91
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,713
Who was it?

92
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,145
It was...

93
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,611
STABLER: How did he get
in the house?

94
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,656
Well, he stays there.

95
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,484
He stays there?
Why?

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,587
Well, he stays there
because he Iost all his money
investing it.

97
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,436
He drinks every night.
Whiskey.

98
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,238
Oh, he smells so awful
when he...

99
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,937
Okay.
We can help you.

100
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,600
I don't Iike it
when he comes
upstairs to me.

101
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,340
We can help you,
but you've got to
tell us his name, okay?

102
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,676
(MUTTERING)

103
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,050
Who?

104
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,627
It's sad.

105
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,393
Frightening. When this
steel trap starts to rust,
call Kevorkian.

106
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,233
Consider that done.

107
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:50,139
Have Adult Protective Services
pick her up.
Where are we on her ID?

108
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,677
We re-canvassed
the building and did
a sweep of the neighborhood.

109
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,734
No one's
claiming her.

110
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,008
Well, she said
her abuser
Iives with her.

111
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,277
MUNCH: Yeah, so
he won't be calling
Missing Persons.

112
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,581
Well, how far could
this Iady have gone
in her nightie?

113
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,145
She broke into that apartment
for a reason. She must have
Iived there at some point.

114
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,157
Manager's been there
20 years.
He's never seen her.

115
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,388
That building's been there
at Ieast a hundred.
Go back further.

116
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,698
The 1930 census
was just unsealed this year.

117
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:22,406
I can give you the name, age,
sex and race of any person
at any address.

118
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:26,912
Assuming they weren't paranoid
conspiracy freaks with
a wicked big-brother complex.

119
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,540
Well, that's why it's sealed
for 72 years, to cover
the average Iife span.

120
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,609
Actually, 72 is the
average man's Iife span.
A woman's is 79.

121
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,917
Oh, a man
who knows his stats.

122
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,951
Did you know the 1930 census
takes 2,667 rolls of...

123
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,520
Yo, stop, stop, stop.
Okay. There's Seventh.
Back up.

124
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,760
There's Sixth
and there's
the building, 213.

125
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,396
Yeah. Apartment 1-A.
The Staytons.

126
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,337
EIIsworth, Hilda

127
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,244
and three daughters,
Lilith, 11, Isabel, 10,
and Millie, eight.

128
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,510
Today they'd be 83,
82 and 80.

129
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,312
She's gotta be
one of these three girls.

130
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,813
STABLER: This isn't Lilith
or Isabel?

131
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,913
MILLIE: No, both my sisters
passed on.

132
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:16,793
Lily in '92
and cancer took Izzy
back in '78.

133
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,353
You called Isabel
"Izzy"?

134
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,092
Everyone did.

135
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,157
No one ever
called her "Itsy"?

136
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,500
Dear Lord,
Itsy and Bitsy.

137
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,233
I haven't thought
about her in years.

138
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,831
Who was Bitsy?

139
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,970
A neighbor girl
down the street.
Isabel's best friend.

140
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,383
It was Bitsy for Bess.
Bess Maclntyre.

141
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,679
Did Bess ever
Iive with you?

142
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:44,246
No, no. But sometimes
she'd sneak over
in the middle of the night.

143
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,653
Poor thing,
cry herself to sleep.

144
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,497
She would wake up
your whole family
in the middle of the night?

145
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,761
Oh, no, no,
she'd sneak in
through a window.

146
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,963
Why was she crying?

147
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,334
I was too young
to understand at the time,

148
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:05,741
but Bess had what we used
to call a "funny uncle."

149
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,975
Mother never Iet us play
at her house the whole time
he Iived there.

150
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,286
(WHISPERING) I got it, thanks.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,025
I'm sorry,
did I wake you?

152
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,028
Who are you?

153
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,801
I'm OIivia. Remember?

154
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,175
And I'm sorry,
do you go by Bitsy
or Bess now?

155
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,805
Bess.

156
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,607
We've never met.

157
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,151
We had a Iong talk
this morning.

158
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,218
After the hospital?

159
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,982
I never go to a hospital.

160
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,959
I'm a very healthy person.
I am healthy as a...
As a horseshoe.

161
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,828
What is this place?

162
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:04,863
Why am I here?

163
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,996
You're in a police station.

164
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,640
I was arrested?

165
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,109
No, no, no.
You were attacked.

166
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,876
You said that it was
the man staying with you.

167
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,248
The man
who Iost all his money
in the stock market.

168
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,622
Were you talking
about your uncle?

169
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,319
What year
did he Iose
all his money?

170
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:38,132
What year did he Iose
all his money? He Iost his
money in 1929. Everybody did.

171
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,833
Bess, that was over
70 years ago.

172
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:47,105
Your uncle hurt you
when you were Iittle. Tell me,
who is hurting you now?

173
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,293
Well, in the small favors
category, her rape kit
came back negative.

174
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,126
You Iook at those burns
and tell me this skeev
did her any favors.

175
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,928
Looks Iike
the doc's done with her.
What'd you get?

176
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,902
The attack definitely
triggered memories
of her childhood molestation.

177
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,304
So she fled to the only
safe harbor she could think
of, her friend Isabel's home.

178
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,365
She'd sneak through
the window Iike
she did Iast night.

179
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,070
Who is she running from?

180
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,874
I doubt she's ever gonna
be able to tell you.

181
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,244
So we just solved
a 70-year-old rape case.

182
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:27,081
Uncle Ted was arrested in '53
on five counts of rape,
but not for Bess.

183
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,745
He was killed in prison
in '57.

184
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,016
Well, somebody tortured her
again Iast night

185
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,887
and I'm pretty sure
it wasn't the dead uncle.

186
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,482
So, who are we Iooking for?

187
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,357
A sadist.
He enjoyed the torture,

188
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,057
though I'm not sure
if it was sexual
or anger-based.

189
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,065
He's young
or socially stunted.

190
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,897
He chose an enfeebled woman
because of feelings
of inadequacy.

191
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,903
I tracked Bess
through Social Security.

192
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,532
Her checks are sent care of
Jubilee Towers on Madison.

193
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,080
Nice place
for a nursing home.

194
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,583
We're not a nursing home.
We're an assisted
Iiving facility.

195
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,845
Hello. Hope Garrett.
Hi.

196
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,649
Assistant Administrator.
How may I help you?

197
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm Detective Benson.
This is my partner,
Detective Stabler.

198
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,459
Are you aware
that one of your residents
went missing Iast night?

199
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,963
Well, it couldn't have been
anyone from the nursing wing

200
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:17,162
because they're checked
on a regular basis.
Let's see. Uh...

201
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,470
Yes, all our Level One-ers
are accounted for.

202
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,973
You do bed checks?

203
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,603
The residents are required
to flip a switch
every morning,

204
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,613
just to Iet us know
that they're still with us.

205
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,310
Well, I can guarantee you
Bess Sherman did not flip
her own switch today.

206
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,408
How could she have?

207
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,683
Mrs. Sherman was released
about two weeks ago.

208
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,251
To whom?

209
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,486
Her son.
Joe Sherman.

210
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,488
Mr. Sherman?

211
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,364
These folks have a warrant.
I'm Ietting them in.

212
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,960
He's usually home from work
about now.

213
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,026
Nice place.

214
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,231
No, it's his mother's.

215
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,831
Rent-controlled.
$350 a month,
you believe that?

216
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,137
Mr. Sherman smoke?

217
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,905
Only in between
the times he quits.

218
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,607
How's Joe been getting along
with his mother
since she moved back in?

219
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,308
AII I know is
she sure brought him
some Iuck.

220
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
How so?

221
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,679
Well, ever since
she came back,
the repo men stopped coming,

222
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,277
deliveries started.

223
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,220
Deliveries.
What kind of deliveries?

224
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:17,259
Big-screen TV came in
over the weekend.
Couch, chairs, the media unit.

225
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,730
Got all the bells
and whistles, CD, DVD,

226
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,530
stereo, video, got a TiVo.

227
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,930
EIIiot.

228
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,634
Really fixed
this place up.

229
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,640
Except for this room.

230
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,940
Bess' room,
I'm assuming.

231
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,003
Looks more
Iike her cell.
Check this out.

232
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,342
Explains
the restraint marks.

233
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,316
Joe didn't want to Iose
his Iucky charm.

234
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,910
Who are you,
and what are you
doing here?

235
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,821
Police. Just checking out
your mother's accommodations.

236
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,290
Well, where is she?
Is she okay?

237
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,556
She's safer than she was
in this place. Let's go.

238
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,421
I wanna see my mother.
When we're done.

239
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,296
Have a cigarette.
I don't smoke.

240
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,267
Really?
We heard you did.
I quit.

241
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,826
Could I see her
right now?

242
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,997
As soon as
you explain these.

243
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,830
She never
bruised before.

244
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,308
It's some way
to treat your mother.

245
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,470
She wanders at night.
It's for her own protection.

246
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,640
Protection? But
you don't protect her
from this.

247
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,149
Oh, my God!

248
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,753
Oh, my God.

249
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,562
Well, you don't think
I burned her?

250
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,290
Actually, we do.

251
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,662
Well, then
you're more confused
than she is.

252
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,669
Obviously some pervert
attacked her on the street
when she got out.

253
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,364
BENSON: But you didn't notice
she was gone.

254
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,101
I had an early
breakfast meeting.
I didn't want to wake her.

255
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,303
But you don't mind
Ieaving her tied up
to a bed for 18 hours?

256
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,369
Now, how was she supposed
to use the bathroom?

257
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,575
Look, the housekeeper
takes care of that.
Maria comes in every morning.

258
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,618
She makes Mom breakfast.
She wakes her up.

259
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,947
But she didn't come
this morning.

260
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,750
No. I don't know why
Maria didn't call me.
And believe me, she's fired.

261
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,087
Well, we'II take care of
that for you.
What's her Iast name?

262
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,182
Her name is Sanchez.

263
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,625
You know, your mother
would've been just fine

264
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,821
if you hadn't pulled her
from that nice
retirement community.

265
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,492
They were draining her.
She paid those crooks
seven grand a month.

266
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,592
Leaving
nothing for you.

267
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,538
AII right, you know what?
I'm done. So you either
charge me, or you Iet me go.

268
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,002
And I'm gonna
take my mother with me.

269
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,141
No way we're releasing Bess
into his custody.

270
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,184
He's her Iegal guardian.

271
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,610
He's her abuser.

272
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,176
According to whom?

273
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,155
You have no witnesses,
and the victim
can't make a complaint.

274
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,158
Look, we suspect
a parent of abuse,

275
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,251
Child Services doesn't
need the victim's complaint.

276
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,159
The Iaw assumes
a child can't speak up
for itself.

277
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,063
CRAGEN: Neither can Bess.
And her son
is strapping her to a bed.

278
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,260
A Iawyer could argue
he believed
it was a reasonable,

279
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,803
albeit very misguided,
attempt to keep Bess safe.

280
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,932
Look, AIex,
there's gotta be some way
to get this guy on neglect.

281
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,272
In an attempt to ensure
her safety, he endangered her.
It's a stretch.

282
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,408
Well, then stretch it
into an order of removal.

283
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,610
We'II stall Joe.

284
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,023
What's the problem now?

285
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,889
I have a protective order
to place your mother
back in Jubilee Towers

286
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,292
until this matter
is straightened out.

287
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,556
My mom
belongs with me.

288
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,427
The courts
disagree with you.

289
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,558
Mom. Mom,
would you tell them
that I did not hurt you?

290
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,728
Why is it so noisy
in here?

291
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,132
I'm gonna sue
every one of your asses.

292
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,605
Lawyers are
mighty expensive, Joe.

293
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,405
Here's a protective order
freezing your mother's
accounts and assets.

294
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,241
You can't do that.

295
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,341
Mom, don't you worry,
I am gonna bring you home!

296
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,112
Captain, got any tissues
for me? I'm about
to break out into tears.

297
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,780
Hey, escort Mr. Sherman
out the back.

298
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,591
We'II see if we can
dig up any dirt
from the neighbors,

299
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,493
see if Maria the housekeeper
even exists.

300
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,521
BENSON: Maria Sanchez?

301
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,059
Yes.

302
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,328
You work for Joe Sherman,
take care of his mother,
Bess?

303
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,997
Yes, what's wrong?

304
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,405
BENSON: Did you go to work
yesterday?

305
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,906
No one was there.
I thought maybe
he took her to the doctor.

306
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:57,073
She ran away sometime
the night before. Could you
come up here, please?

307
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,743
We'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

308
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,578
Do you have any idea
what she was running from?

309
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,588
You ever see
any marks or bruises
on Mrs. Sherman?

310
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,682
No.

311
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,090
Did you ever see
Mr. Sherman hurt her?

312
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,290
No, but when things
are stressful, he speaks
very harsh with her.

313
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,299
Was he stressed out
Monday?

314
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,996
Very. Everything had to be
just perfect for his party.

315
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,840
JOE: I invited
a few investors over.

316
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,605
You failed to mention it.
It wasn't relevant.

317
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,112
I can assure you
that none of them
touched my mother.

318
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,342
Delway Furniture Rentals
says your Visa
was declined.

319
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,782
Send them a check.
But the bank called...

320
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,978
Just deal with it.
Business troubles?

321
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,615
Police harassment.
You shut us down
when you froze our accounts.

322
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,180
I think you mean
your mother's accounts.

323
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,160
This is a start-up business,
my mother's a key investor.

324
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,220
What about
those big investors
at your party?

325
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,589
Don't go near them.

326
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,691
Why, they see something
you don't want us
to hear about?

327
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,998
Maybe Mom wandered out,
caused a scene,
embarrassed you?

328
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,596
So you drove home
the burning importance
of being a silent partner.

329
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,765
Why are you
trying to destroy me

330
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,639
when the monster
who tortured my mother
is still out there?

331
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,144
Joe, just cough up
the party Iist.

332
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,376
No way in hell
you're ever gonna get
that Iist.

333
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,812
Damn it to hell,
you got crap
all over my shoes.

334
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,186
If you wanna bitch,
switch places.

335
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,884
(EXCLAIMING)

336
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,228
This one's full of rancid
salmon puffs.

337
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,059
FIN: Maybe they didn't go over
too big at Joe's party.

338
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,393
You sure it's Joe's?

339
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,694
Incoming.

340
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,863
Housekeeper said she threw out
three bags with yellow ties.
We gotta check all of them.

341
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,166
Well, here's a Lick magazine

342
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,230
with Joe's address on it.

343
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,166
Hair dye for men.

344
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,404
And something that's
best applied anally.

345
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,851
Stop jerking around
and find the guest book.

346
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,213
Hello!

347
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,622
Names?

348
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,526
Cigarette butts.
One of them's
gotta be our weapon.

349
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:56,931
You're keeping me busy,
Detectives. Forty-five
cigarette butts in all.

350
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,102
Five different brands.

351
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,696
Any way to match
the butts to the wounds?

352
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,867
If we were talking about
cigars or slims.

353
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,346
Unfortunately, most brands
are identical in size,

354
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,177
so there's no way
to narrow down
by wound diameter.

355
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,582
Just need to prove
that the attack took place
in that apartment.

356
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,313
Any way to find
flesh residue?

357
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,684
Well, at
the point of inhalation,

358
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:21,215
the burn zone temperature
is around 850 and 900 degrees.

359
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,557
Seared away
all the evidence.

360
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,359
DNA from
saliva on the filters
will take weeks to run.

361
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,626
We're screwed.
Not really.

362
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,801
Fingerprints.

363
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,669
Ninhydrin.

364
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:39,269
I'II spray them all
and then I'II run them
through the system.

365
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,744
We already
checked out Joe,
no priors.

366
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,874
Yeah, but maybe not all
his mystery smoking guests
are as clean.

367
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,217
Investing in one of these
is Iike buying a Monet.

368
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,453
It's easy on the eyes
as it gains in value.
Will you excuse me, please?

369
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,515
Hi, there!

370
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,686
Hugh Wilkins?

371
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,319
How can I help you?

372
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,058
By fessing up.

373
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,965
The Tychon Food Chopper,

374
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,731
it couldn't really
slice and dice a beer can,
now, could it?

375
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,271
Sure it could.

376
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,934
Of course, you have to follow
the instructional video,
sold separately.

377
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,067
How did you...

378
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,580
When you got bonded to sell
that crap door-to-door,
you gave up your prints.

379
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,105
We found one on
a cigarette butt you Ieft
at Joe Sherman's party.

380
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,516
Did you have any trouble
with his moms that night?

381
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,182
His mother?
I never even saw her.
What's this about?

382
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,451
Joe.

383
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,652
Yeah.
What's his racket?

384
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,289
Oh! The Trifecta Wizard.
It's an unbeatable
horseracing software program.

385
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,362
Unlike his other
get-rich-quick schemes,
this one was "a sure thing."

386
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,631
His other ventures
stumble out of the gate?

387
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,799
Habitually.
You should ask Joe about
his IIama ranch in Texas.

388
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:43,932
That one even
scared off his mother.

389
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,271
She was an investor?

390
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,812
Up until two years ago,
she was
his principal backer.

391
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,279
After that, she had to
guard what was Ieft
of the nest egg.

392
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,407
She cut
the purse strings.

393
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,814
That must have
pissed Joe off.

394
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,181
Well, he went broke.

395
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,485
But then the old Iady
moves back in, Io and behold,
he has start-up money again.

396
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:05,022
According to everyone
we spoke to, Joe has been
a Ieech his entire Iife.

397
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,622
Right behind you,
speak of the devil.

398
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,363
Look, I asked you to stay away
from my investors.
Three just pulled out.

399
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,029
And we're only through
half the Iist.

400
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,095
JOE: You're ruining me.

401
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,834
Like you were
ruining your mother?

402
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,206
We pulled
her financials, Joe.

403
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,270
The only money
I ever took from her
was rent.

404
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,377
Five times a month?

405
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,316
AII made to cash.

406
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,115
Let me see those.

407
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,214
(SIGHS)

408
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,314
Andy.

409
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,483
FIN: He your bookie?

410
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,187
My college dropout son.
He's talked her into
writing checks before.

411
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,093
And was Andy
at the party?

412
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,565
He stopped by, uninvited,
with one of his
deadbeat friends.

413
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,828
He needed a place
to sober up.

414
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,164
They spend the night?

415
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,206
No. I gave him just an hour.
Told him to stay in the den,
out of sight.

416
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,706
Where does
your son Iive?

417
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,538
Jersey.
With his mom.

418
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,672
Now will you Ieave
my investors alone?

419
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,220
What the hell?

420
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,996
ANDY: Who Iet you in?
Your mother.

421
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,466
We heard you were
on the party circuit.

422
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,866
What?

423
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,063
Dad's?
Monday night?

424
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,198
I don't call
being exiled to
the broom closet a party.

425
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:27,109
We also heard that
your dad wasn't too proud
of his dropout son.

426
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,079
Dropout?
Is that what he said?

427
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,614
STABLER: What do you say?

428
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:35,119
My gran set me up with
a college trust fund. I had to
drop out when Dad drained it.

429
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,553
AII he Ieft me with
is a ratty old
IIama-hair coat.

430
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,523
Yeah? And now Gran
won't write out
any more checks.

431
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,116
That must've
pissed you off.

432
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,129
I'm not pissed at Gran.
It's my dad who's a jerk.

433
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,324
I'm the only one
who ever visited her
at the home.

434
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,730
You see her
at the party?

435
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,233
Of course I did.

436
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,637
She write you out
any more checks?

437
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,806
Sometimes
she gives me presents.

438
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,708
She doesn't even know
her own name. Must take
some prodding on your part.

439
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:05,072
She's the only person
in my Iife who ever gave
a crap about me.

440
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,041
I would never,
ever hurt her.

441
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,053
What about that guy
that you hang out with?

442
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,713
Hal?
Yeah. Does he smoke?

443
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,983
Yeah.

444
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,719
Was he ever alone
with your gran
at the party?

445
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,817
I don't know.

446
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,156
You don't know.

447
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,493
I might have
nodded off a bit.
Mmm-hmm.

448
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,201
Where can we find
this Hal?

449
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,634
At work.

450
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,163
Jubilee Towers,
where my gran was.
That's where we met.

451
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,272
He took care of her.

452
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,205
Leave me alone!
Stop it!

453
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,804
You can't make me!

454
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,349
Let go,
Mr. Leonard!

455
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,748
(CRASHING)

456
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,012
Idiot!
Look what you did!

457
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,384
Hey, Hal,
calm down.

458
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,685
Who are you?
We're the police.

459
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,816
Sir, are you okay?

460
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,793
He's trying to kill me.

461
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,488
What do you want?

462
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,320
Are you always this good
with the patients?

463
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,662
Help me,
don't Iet him
take me away.

464
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,168
Don't you worry,
nobody's taking
anybody anywhere.

465
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,898
Oh, please,
don't encourage him.
This happens every day.

466
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,839
Mr. Leonard hates needles.
But he is going to chemo.

467
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,571
We need to talk.
In private.

468
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,613
Look, I've got three patients
Iate for appointments

469
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,705
and I've had nothing
but troublemakers all day.

470
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,840
Troublemakers?

471
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,681
How about Bess Sherman?
She one of your troublemakers?

472
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,414
HAL: No, she's a dream.

473
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,654
We heard
you ran into her
on the outside.

474
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,356
With the end
of a cigarette butt.
Maybe that rings a bell.

475
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,760
I don't know
what you guys
have been smoking,

476
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,928
but I've got
Iives to save.

477
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,276
Jubilee Towers adheres
to the highest standards
of safety.

478
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:48,183
Even we
non-medical employees
are trained in CPR.

479
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,347
Well, have the safety
standards been slipping since
Hal started working here?

480
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,617
Are all of those
complaints?

481
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,056
You have to understand

482
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:58,186
that many patients
will complain if you just
Iook at them wrong.

483
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,321
Hal's worked here
a year.

484
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,797
He's only had
one serious complaint
against him.

485
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,027
Which was what?

486
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,901
Well, Mr. Jackson
accused Hal of trying
to suffocate him.

487
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,397
Well, did you
call the police?

488
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,635
Uh...
Mr. Jackson is senile.

489
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,410
Well, did you
at Ieast check on it?

490
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,879
Of course I did,
but we found nothing.

491
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,313
You have to realize

492
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:22,444
that fiction and reality
blend in the mind
of some of our patients.

493
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,321
You know, we get rape reports
after the enema cart
makes its rounds.

494
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:31,090
Hal didn't strike me
as a real people person. Now,
why hire someone Iike that?

495
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,062
It's a very Iow-paying job.

496
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,498
Not a Iot of people find
changing adult diapers
rewarding.

497
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,331
What else
is in the file?

498
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,429
Just incident reports,
on-duty injuries...

499
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,597
Whoa, whoa.

500
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,073
Hal injured
patients?

501
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,440
No, patients
injured him.

502
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,574
Mr. Jackson?

503
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,809
Yeah?

504
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,745
You the nude models
I ordered?

505
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,583
No. Actually we're...
That was a joke.

506
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,385
What can I do you for?

507
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,755
Heard you had
problems with Hal,
the nurse's aide.

508
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,760
That man's
a serial killer.

509
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,489
Tell us about it.

510
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,796
He pinches me all the time.
One day I bit him, real hard.

511
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,098
Son of a bitch
cut off my oxygen,

512
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,764
whispered,
"You're gonna die soon,
old man."

513
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,101
And nobody
did anything
about it?

514
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,870
MR. JACKSON: Hell, no.
Took his word over mine.

515
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,004
Well, we believe you.
He done anything
since then?

516
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,207
Sheet people scared him off.

517
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,609
Who?
You know who I mean.

518
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:33,249
KIan comes at night,
roams the halls.
Better watch your back.

519
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:41,056
Okay. We had Mr. Jackson
till he took a Ieft
at Mississippi.

520
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,124
Yeah, but even paranoids
are right sometimes.

521
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,931
Oh, we know Hal.
A Iittle short
on the bedside manner.

522
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,500
STABLER: Okay. Well, we heard
you scratched his face.

523
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,272
Why?
I can't say for sure.

524
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,337
Oh, you know,
just tell them.

525
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,541
It was after
I broke my hip
Iast fall.

526
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,279
Yeah, taking
dancing Iessons
for that cruise.

527
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,322
Anyway,
when I came back
after surgery,

528
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:08,291
I woke up one night,
convinced that someone
was suffocating me.

529
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,418
Was it Hal?

530
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,485
Well, it sure
wasn't the morphine.

531
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:16,398
AII I know is that I thought
I was dying. I started
clawing at something.

532
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,333
Then, suddenly,
I could breathe again.

533
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,200
When I opened my eyes,

534
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:24,264
Hal was standing over me,
his face scratched
and bleeding.

535
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,400
What'd he say?

536
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,570
That I was hallucinating.

537
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,975
He pinches the patients,
hides their dentures,

538
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,314
and when he wants a real rush,
he plays keep-away
with their oxygen.

539
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,719
But here's the rub.
Every victim was either
doped up or senile.

540
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,279
Making them
the perfect victims.

541
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,349
Even if they remember
what happened, they're still
unreliable witnesses.

542
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,361
That's probably why
he took the job
in the first place.

543
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,420
He gets his rocks off
watching them suffer.

544
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,726
What do you got?

545
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,166
A notice of claim
filed six months ago
against Jubilee Towers.

546
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,533
A $10 million
negligence suit

547
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,936
brought about by the estate
of a deceased former resident.

548
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,132
What happened?

549
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,438
Doesn't say.
A settlement was reached
with a nondisclosure clause.

550
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,138
Who was named in the suit?

551
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,442
Everyone the dead woman
came into contact with,

552
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,983
from the director
down to the Iowliest
of nurse's aides.

553
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,678
Including our pal Hal?

554
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,413
This dead woman
have a name?

555
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,011
Dahlia Brown.

556
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,990
I'm already working
on an exhumation order.

557
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,158
Not bad for nine months
in the ground.

558
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,891
Skin's perfectly intact.

559
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,456
She's Iost some muscle tone,
but haven't we all?

560
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,231
You know the day's coming
when embalming fluid
is put in a Iotion.

561
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:30,934
WARNER: Until then that time,
it will remain the medical
examiner's worst nightmare.

562
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,036
When the undertaker
flushed out her blood, he
also flushed away any toxins.

563
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,879
The embalming fluid then
dissolved any protein-based
poison in her organs.

564
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,508
Anything you
could test for?

565
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,815
Tissue toxicology,
heavy metals,

566
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,345
which came back negative
for arsenic, Iead and cyanide.

567
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,949
The death certificate
said cardiac arrest.

568
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,892
Which means
we don't know
what really happened,

569
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,759
but we don't think
it was foul play.

570
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,299
The M.E.'s gotta put
something down
for cause of death.

571
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,890
What would you have put?

572
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:00,597
I don't know,
but I certainly
would have mentioned this.

573
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,943
A tiny pinprick hole
unaccounted for
in the medical records.

574
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,706
She was in the hospital wing.
Maybe they gave her an IV.

575
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,114
She was in to have
her knee drained.
The hole's in the wrong place.

576
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,709
You settled with
the deceased's daughter.

577
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,277
Realize you made
a mistake?

578
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,153
No, it was cheaper
than going to court.

579
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,382
Well, then
what happened with Dahlia?

580
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,519
Well, grieving people
sometimes have trouble

581
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,894
accepting the death
of Ioved ones.

582
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,025
The pain makes them Iook
for someone to blame.

583
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,000
Well, speaking of which,
I noticed in Dahlia's records

584
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:37,405
that her Iast supper
was delivered by somebody
with the initials H.S.

585
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,402
STABLER: Any other nurses'
aides with those initials
besides Hal Shipley?

586
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:45,980
We're gonna need to speak
with anybody

587
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,110
who might have seen him
with Dahlia that night.

588
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,320
Okay.

589
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:53,854
Man, I don't want
to grow old.

590
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,393
In our Iine of work,
be careful what you
wish for. How'd you do?

591
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,258
No one remembers
any fireworks
between them,

592
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,388
but I did find out
a Iittle about Dahlia.

593
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,489
Great Iady,
Iousy patient?

594
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,329
When she was in pain,
she was a pain.

595
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,164
Needy and demanding,
Hal's favorite.

596
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,931
Yeah, he had means,
he had opportunity

597
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,838
with Bess, Dahlia,
Mr. Jackson, a dozen others.

598
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,399
That we know of.
He's Iike a psycho kid
in a candy store.

599
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,910
Time to take away
his candy.

600
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,912
Excuse me, where...
Room 410's coding.

601
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,208
Quick,
get the crash cart.

602
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,011
410 is Bess' room.

603
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,744
ANNOUNCER: Code blue
to room 410.
Code blue to room 410.

604
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,753
WOMAN: Hurry! In here!

605
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,247
Hope.

606
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,421
You were right.
I saw it was him.
He was...

607
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,462
Let's calm down.
Just take a breath
and tell us what happened.

608
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,224
After we talked,
I called Hal in

609
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,927
and, you know,
I told him to finish
his shift and Ieave.

610
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,434
He wanted to know why,
and I told him.

611
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,528
I said, "It's because
of the way
you treat the patients."

612
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,300
And he was furious
and he just stormed out.

613
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,568
You can't help in there.
Now, did he make
any threats?

614
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,701
No, but after
what we talked about,
you know...

615
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,942
I was worried, so I came down
to check on Bess,
and that's when I saw him.

616
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,607
What was he doing?
He was just...

617
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,244
He was Ieaving the room,
but I didn't even think.

618
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,347
I just went in there
and her pulse was weak
and thready

619
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,359
and I just pushed
the code button
and started CPR.

620
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,552
Hold on, hold on.

621
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,290
Bess?
NURSE: Move her
to the full-care wing.

622
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,257
I'm gonna go with her.

623
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,961
NURSE: Put her on a monitor
and start an IV.

624
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,230
She had a fresh
needle mark.

625
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:23,641
What are you still
doing here?
We heard you were fired.

626
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,980
The pencil-pushing
bootlicker told me
to finish off my shift.

627
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,384
Account for
your whereabouts
for the Iast 15 minutes.

628
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,855
Stockroom.
Taking inventory.

629
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,392
Let's go for a ride, Hal.
Am I under arrest?

630
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,519
No.
Then screw off.

631
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,628
Excuse me?

632
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,268
Whatever. Let's party.

633
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,912
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

634
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,508
Yeah, a big
tearful goodbye.

635
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,383
Oh, you really don't
wanna miss this.

636
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,183
STABLER: You got
a Iatent print report?

637
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,451
Hal's known,
identified print.

638
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,585
From that Iast cig break
at the Towers.
You really shouldn't Iitter.

639
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,993
You can't do that.

640
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,997
Yeah, well, you
voluntarily discarded it.

641
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,090
Meaning Iegally,
your butt is ours.

642
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,295
As is this one,
retrieved from Joe Sherman's
party trash.

643
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,565
Well, that Iooks
Iike a match.
Seven-point.

644
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,301
We've got a bifurcation,
three ending ridges
and an island.

645
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,434
Lots of guys
were smoking
at the party.

646
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,912
Yeah? Well, how many
had seared flesh at the end
of their cancer sticks?

647
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,642
That we can match
to Bess Sherman.

648
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,377
Uh... Where's the Iab
on the DNA?

649
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,941
I'm on my way there
right now.

650
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,509
Call us when you know.
When we have the results,

651
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,521
we won't need a confession
from pantywaist here.

652
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,648
No confession,
no plea bargain.

653
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,716
Which means
you do the max.

654
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,962
CSU said they couldn't
get flesh off
of the cigarette.

655
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,724
Oops.

656
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,235
Okay, I burned her.

657
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,532
What?

658
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,998
I burned her.
Why?

659
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,435
It's not Iike
I planned it.

660
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,674
Andy owed me a Iot of money,
which he said he could get
from Grandma Bess.

661
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,340
Owed you money
for what?

662
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,577
Nothing to do
with this.

663
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,784
He pulls a check
from her purse, says,
"You need to sign this, Gran."

664
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,016
Bam, she does.

665
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,321
So it's so easy,
you think you're gonna
try it yourself.

666
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,827
So you go back in,
get another check.

667
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,157
And she yells, "Rape."

668
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,791
Just Iike she used to
at the home when
I'd help dress her. As if.

669
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,028
Your job sucked, we know.
No, you don't know!

670
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,129
I had to clean them
and feed them
and wipe up their crap.

671
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,639
STABLER: They owed you.

672
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,437
So all she had to do
was sign the other check.

673
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,776
But what does she do?
She screams? She tried
to get you in trouble.

674
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,119
So I go over
to quiet her down,

675
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,381
and my cigarette
accidentally burns her chest.

676
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,151
And she starts screaming rape
at the top of her Iungs,

677
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,591
and I just...
I just snap.

678
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,089
I say,
"I'II show you rape."

679
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,099
And I pull up her nightgown

680
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,898
and I jab that cigarette
at her again and again
and again.

681
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,868
What happened
when you saw her today?

682
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,470
I didn't see her today.

683
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,072
Sweetie, we've got a witness
who saw you Ieaving her room.

684
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,515
Then they were hallucinating.

685
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,076
When she coded,
I was in the stockroom.
I can prove it.

686
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,722
Hal's been hacking into
the drug computer. Son of
a bitch was stealing drugs.

687
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,960
Maybe he fudged
the times.

688
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:31,400
According to the tech, this
machine is Iike the Fort Knox
of drug dispensers.

689
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,494
Then he's covered.
His Iist of stolen
nurses' codes

690
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,369
matches perfectly
to what we found
in his Iocker.

691
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,602
Well, Hope swore
she saw him Ieaving
Bess' room.

692
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,543
So, if the computer's
not Iying...

693
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,638
Bess isn't the first patient
Hope has saved, you know.

694
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,739
Really?

695
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,275
She found Mrs. Mercer
in cardiac arrest
Iast Christmas Eve.

696
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,378
Same situation?
She started CPR?

697
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,447
Can you imagine
a more depressing day
to die?

698
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,786
Sounds Iike
a Christmas miracle.

699
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,588
I think there was
one other time.

700
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,288
Zona?
ZONA: Yeah?

701
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,694
Didn't Hope Garrett
save another patient before?

702
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,494
Oh. She tried.
The guy didn't make it.

703
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,693
No, this was a woman.

704
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,702
Remember, uh, senior prom?

705
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,930
Oh, yeah.

706
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,905
Senior prom
with the emphasis
on "senior"?

707
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,499
It's a dance
the Level One-ers throw
every spring.

708
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,272
Their anti-youth
counterstatement.

709
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:18,475
You know, the punch always
gets spiked, somebody tries
to Iimbo and breaks a hip.

710
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,508
So this woman that Hope saved
was otherwise
a healthy dance casualty.

711
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:26,387
Well, she wasn't dancing.
She collapsed
at the buffet table.

712
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,190
It's a good thing
Hope knows her CPR.

713
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,160
I'm not gonna Iet
anybody else hurt you, Ma.
You're coming home with me.

714
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,290
You sure that's
in her best interest?

715
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,856
Oh, I don't know,
maybe I'II throw her
back in

716
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,993
with that Iunatic
who burned her,
Iike you did.

717
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,332
Dad, you're upsetting Gran.

718
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,837
JOE: No Iip from you.

719
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,203
You're the one that started

720
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,368
this whole thing by Ietting
that drug supplier
into my house.

721
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,775
I'II come by Iater, Gran.

722
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,608
I'II bring those brochures
of the other homes.

723
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,671
Sweet boy.

724
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,479
Just so you know,
Hal's in custody. He won't be
hurting anybody else.

725
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,985
Oh, you're so quick.

726
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,851
It only took two attempts
on my mother's Iife
for you to figure it out.

727
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,117
You're my friend,
aren't you?

728
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,488
Yes, I am, Bess.

729
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,992
Make this man be quiet.

730
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,891
Don't you worry about it.
He's just Ieaving.

731
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,361
JOE: Guess again.

732
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,092
I was wrongly accused.
The protective order
was dropped.

733
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,397
Well, I hear that
the misappropriation
of funds investigation

734
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,300
is just beginning.

735
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,532
Uh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

736
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,733
No, you're welcome
anytime.

737
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,875
And thanks for
saving my mother's Iife.

738
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,606
Oh, well, Bess
is one of
our favorites.

739
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,182
No way
she's going anywhere
while I'm around.

740
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,378
So, you have saved,
what, three now?

741
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,316
Including Bess,
yeah, I guess so.

742
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,951
And just that
one Ioss.

743
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,289
Mr. Tazelo.

744
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,124
Yeah, what happened?

745
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:44,701
I was passing by X-ray and
there he was, just slumped
over in his wheelchair.

746
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,795
So, he'd been Ieft
unattended?

747
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,341
I'm sure an aide
was on the way.

748
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,240
But he was alone
Iong enough
to die unnoticed.

749
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,142
Or was he still breathing
when you found him?

750
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,841
He was. I mean,
you know, he was dead.

751
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,283
But you still tried
to resuscitate him.

752
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,683
Well, I didn't know
how Iong
he'd been there.

753
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,916
We bring people back
all the time. So, I just, um,

754
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:11,924
you know, pulled him
to the floor and started CPR.
I didn't want to give up.

755
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,965
They had to pull me off.

756
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,969
This woman
is a complete wacko.

757
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,267
It could be
malignant hero syndrome.

758
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,706
A person
sets up a risky situation
to create an emergency

759
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,140
and then comes out a hero.

760
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,609
Like a fireman
starting a fire.

761
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,011
It's all about personal gain.
In this case, attention,
prestige.

762
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,515
Like Munchausen by proxy.

763
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,075
She kills people
just to bring them back
to feel better about herself.

764
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,848
What was she
shooting them up with?

765
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,449
I picked up
Bess' tox screen report
from the hospital wing.

766
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,255
There's no poisons,
no anomalous drugs.

767
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,430
She had epinephrine
in her system.

768
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,694
That's what they give
when your heart stops,
right?

769
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,791
Exactly.

770
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,359
I guess that's why it's under
the "no big surprise" column.

771
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,200
Well, Hope revived Bess
with CPR.

772
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,004
Once her heart was started
again, she shouldn't have been
given epinephrine.

773
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,341
And according to
this chart, she wasn't.

774
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,439
What would happen
if that was given to somebody
who had a healthy heart?

775
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,211
It would speed up
heart rate,

776
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:11,187
increasing cardiac output
and blood pressure
to a dangerous Ievel.

777
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,745
Mimicking a heart attack.

778
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,552
Perfect crime.

779
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,553
Son of a bitch.
Hope was a nurse.

780
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,720
She worked at
Oak GIade Nursing Home.

781
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,063
Her Iicense
was revoked
15 years ago.

782
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,727
FIN: On what grounds?

783
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,264
Gross negligence.

784
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,303
"Failed to dilute
potassium chloride doses."

785
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:39,848
It's cozy, isn't it?
An elevator adjacent. Do you
Iike to swim, Mr. Hamrick?

786
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,852
Because you're gonna Iove
the water aerobics class.

787
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,512
I hear that really gets
your heart rate up.

788
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,148
It's a hell of a Iot safer
than being injected
with epinephrine.

789
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,657
Is everything
all right?

790
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,217
Absolutely.
Excuse me one minute.

791
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,661
EIIiot, OIivia. Um...

792
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,334
This probably isn't
a good time to talk
about the unpleasantness.

793
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,062
Oh, we don't plan
to discuss it here.

794
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,330
Good.

795
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,396
A squad room would be
much more appropriate.

796
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,072
Did something new
happen with Hal?

797
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:10,102
Well, our techs
pulled the used syringes
on the Sharps boxes here.

798
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,308
Hal's prints
weren't on
any of them.

799
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,715
Well, he had access to,

800
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,312
you know,
over a dozen boxes
of surgical gloves,

801
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,118
so maybe
he thought
to use a pair.

802
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,658
STABLER: You didn't.

803
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:26,493
They found your prints
on a syringe of epi in the box
at the nurses' station.

804
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,198
Well, you know Hal did it.
He confessed.

805
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,961
BENSON: To burning her.

806
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:35,768
But you didn't give a damn
about that as Iong as
you could grab the spotlight.

807
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,169
Why are you trying
to embarrass me?
People can hear you.

808
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,544
Drama queen, you enjoy
being the center of attention.

809
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,311
Hope Garrett, you're
under arrest for the attempted
murder of Bess Sherman...

810
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,409
What are you talking about?

811
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,784
...and suspicion of murders
committed at
Oak GIade Nursing Home.

812
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,085
This is ridiculous, okay?
You have the right
to remain silent.

813
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,522
This is absolutely ridiculous.
It's a mistake.

814
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,152
If you give up that right,
anything you say...
This is a mistake!

815
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,630
I examined the records
of 22 deaths at Oak GIade

816
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,329
between May of 1982
and March of 1987.

817
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,269
And what did you find?

818
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,536
Evidence of
potassium poisoning
in seven of them.

819
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,537
Why wasn't this discovered
in any of their autopsies?

820
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,546
WARNER: People expect
the elderly to die.

821
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:20,277
An autopsy is performed
maybe one out of 25 cases.

822
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,251
CABOT: Well, surely
some of them were examined?

823
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,345
Yes, but when cells die,
they release potassium.

824
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,288
It would have been
impossible to detect.

825
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,620
So, how did you?

826
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,683
By examining
their EKGs.

827
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,389
Could you please
show us on the board?

828
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:39,468
AII showed tachycardia
and a widened QRS,
indicative of hyperkalemia.

829
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,300
CABOT: Uh...
In Iayman's terms?

830
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,840
WARNER: Their hearts
were beating too fast.

831
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,271
Dr. Warner, what causes there
to be too much potassium
in the blood?

832
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:51,246
Kidney failure can,
or it was introduced
by an outside source.

833
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,483
Did any of them
have kidney disease?

834
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,816
No. Someone administered
Iethal doses.

835
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,583
Do you have any idea
how many mistakes
doctors make,

836
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,249
how many times
I've covered their asses?

837
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,587
Counselor,
you control your client,

838
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,093
or I'II have her removed
from this courtroom.

839
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,150
Yes, Your Honor.

840
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,027
JUDGE: The jury will disregard
the defendant's outburst.

841
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,998
The People may proceed.

842
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,101
One Iast question, Dr. Warner.

843
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,764
In all these cases, how many
different administering nurses
were there?

844
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,740
Just one.
Hope Garrett.

845
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,708
Yes, but you
have to understand

846
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,870
every Iast one of them
was at death's door.
JUDGE: Counselor.

847
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,107
Your Honor, I'm sorry.
This won't happen again.

848
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,082
You know, I don't think
you realize how Iittle time
that they had Ieft.

849
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,982
I don't care if they were
on their very Iast breath.

850
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,418
You had no right
to take it from them.

851
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,548
You don't understand.
I help people.
What do you do?

852
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,421
You stupid bitch!
Hope!

853
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,087
This is not helping.
Court is recessed.
Bailiff, take the jury out.

854
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,687
How can you just sit there
and Iet them crucify me?

855
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,925
I don't need this, you know.
I'm Ieaving.

856
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,591
JUDGE: Court officers,
remove the defendant.

857
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:49,537
This is not fair. AII you
tell them about is
Oak GIade and Jubilee Towers.

858
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,474
But I've worked in homes
for 15 years in between.

859
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,840
And how many of them
did you kill?

860
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,902
I didn't kill anybody.

861
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,005
Maybe a few of them
wouldn't pull through for me,

862
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,482
but I have saved hundreds.
Hundreds.

863
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,679
And you don't even care
about them, do you?

864
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,813
Take your hands off of me!

865
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,890
Let go of me!
