00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:07,998
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,043
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,638
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,341
These are their stories.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,781
AII right,
I got the pick.
I got the pick.

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,446
Switch! Switch!

9
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,113
I got you.

10
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,419
What you got?
What you got?

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,188
LYNN: Help me!

12
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,956
Help me!

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,055
Help me, please!

14
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,224
My God.

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,766
Help me!

16
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,768
Lynn, what's wrong?

17
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,201
He's not breathing.

18
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,898
My baby's not breathing.

19
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,736
Tuck, call 911.
AII right.

20
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:42,866
Hurry up!

21
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,000
Jawan!

22
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,476
Oh, my God!

23
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,070
(SOBBING)

24
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,480
Baby's name
is Jawan Hauser,
10 weeks old.

25
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,075
EMS brought him in
a couple of hours ago.

26
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,177
How's he doing?

27
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,119
On a respirator,
his pulse is weak.

28
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,747
Kid was probably
oxygen deprived.

29
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,190
We won't know the extent
of the brain damage
until he wakes up,

30
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,352
if he ever does.

31
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,588
We talking shaken baby?

32
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,823
Body scan's negative
for healed fractures.

33
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,058
Head CT normal.

34
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,066
No bruising
or retinal hemorrhaging.

35
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,295
So, you must have
brought us in here
for a reason.

36
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,803
I was concerned
when he came in.

37
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,669
EIevated heart rate,
shallow respirations,
dilated pupils.

38
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,231
Sounds Iike an OD.

39
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,800
You're right.
Tox screen's positive
for cocaine.

40
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,903
Someone doped this kid up.

41
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,597
Cocaine?

42
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,360
And you think
I gave it to my baby?

43
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,731
We're not jumping
to any conclusions.

44
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,326
Because I'm black,
Iive in the projects,

45
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,893
so I must be
doing drugs, right?

46
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,735
Why don't we calm down?
That's not what we're saying.

47
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,638
My mother was a junkie.

48
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,734
I never touched that dope
in my Iife.

49
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,608
I worked my ass off
cleaning houses

50
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,977
to keep me and Jawan
in that apartment.

51
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,885
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

52
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,119
I picked up Jawan
from his daycare after work,

53
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,751
brought him home.

54
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,228
I fed him,
but he wasn't very hungry

55
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,559
because he went
right to sleep,

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,327
so I put him
in his crib.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,494
When I checked on him,
he was hardly breathing.

58
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,935
Is Jawan dead?

59
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,632
No. No. No.

60
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,004
But the doctors say
that the cocaine Iooks Iike

61
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,872
it was mixed in
with the baby formula.

62
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,639
Oh, God.

63
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,373
How did that happen?

64
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,539
Well, we need
to find out fast.

65
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,845
Where'd you buy
the formula?

66
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,942
At the store.

67
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,486
Which store?

68
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,513
I don't remember.

69
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,649
Lynn, you gotta
Iisten to me.

70
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,454
You do not want
to be responsible

71
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,859
for that poison being fed
to another baby.

72
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,792
It was my fault.
I borrowed it.

73
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,992
From the people
that you clean for?

74
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,197
I was short on money,
so I had to.

75
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,797
I swear, I was gonna
give it back.

76
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,643
Oh, my God.

77
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,544
You have to call them.
They have a 4-month-old boy.

78
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,618
Thank God
I got your message.

79
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,348
Tommy and I
just got back
from the park.

80
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,447
I was about to
feed him.

81
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,185
Baby Growth
is the brand we use,

82
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,521
but you said
someone poisoned it?

83
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,221
I can't believe
she would do
something Iike that.

84
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,160
Well, we can't take
any chances.

85
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,529
My God, if I had
given it to Tommy...

86
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,192
I keep all the formula
in here.

87
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,168
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
we're gonna need to do that.
Sorry.

88
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,761
Do you remember how many
cans you had Ieft?

89
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,635
Six. I buy it by the case.

90
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,901
BENSON: I count five.

91
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,465
Lynn must have taken
the missing can.

92
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,874
LAURA: I never noticed.

93
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,378
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
it's urgent that we know

94
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,779
where and when you bought
this baby formula.

95
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,976
My husband got it
a couple of days ago.

96
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,178
Gentry's Market on Columbus.

97
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,189
We took every can
of formula
off the shelves at Gentry's,

98
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,088
tested each one.
AII clear.

99
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,750
What about the ones
in Pfeiffer's pantry?

100
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,089
Four, perfectly
normal Iiquid,

101
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,253
and the other one
had the same chemistry

102
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,058
as the stuff fed
to Jawan Hauser.

103
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,655
Cocaine-Iaced
baby formula.

104
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,032
I wouldn't call it formula.
It's 90% pure Iiquid cocaine.

105
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,298
That purity probably came
from south of the border.

106
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,169
I've never seen it
smuggled this way before.

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,504
Take a Iook, solder plug.

108
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,770
That's where
they drained the formula

109
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,311
and refilled it
with Iiquid coke.

110
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,313
Seal it up,
glue the Iabel back on,

111
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,508
ship a couple of cases
to los Estados Unidos,

112
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,982
nobody's any the wiser.

113
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,848
They gotta have Iabs
on both sides
of the border

114
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,716
to turn it into Iiquid,
then back into powder.

115
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,585
And how'd this end up
on some store shelf?

116
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,751
I can't help you there,
but the manufacturer can.

117
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,294
Baby formula's closely
regulated by the FDA.

118
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,592
Each can has a Iot number
and expiration date on top.

119
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,828
You can find out
where it was made
and purchased.

120
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,925
I called the FDA.

121
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,732
They're gonna issue
a CIass I recall,
highest priority.

122
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,399
AII the FDA can do
is ask the company
to pull the product.

123
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,271
Not when it involves
infant formula.

124
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,573
Then they have the authority.
How're we doing?

125
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,772
Every can of Baby Growth
in the market

126
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,405
and every clean can
at the Pfeiffers'

127
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,211
was made
at the Atlanta plant.

128
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,546
And the two bad cans?

129
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,950
Lot numbers
weren't even close.

130
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,282
Why? Because
they were manufactured

131
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,347
at the Baby Growth plant
in Mexico. Juárez.

132
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,052
Cartel country.

133
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,026
So, our friends
get it down there,

134
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,893
replace the Spanish
Ianguage Iabels
with ones in English,

135
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,158
and then they smuggle it
up here.

136
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,427
Yeah, the question is
how did those two cans
from Mexico

137
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,763
end up in
the Pfeiffers' closet?

138
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,269
Well, what do we know
about the Pfeiffers?

139
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,068
She's home with the baby.
The husband's name is Derek.

140
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,129
He's a stockbroker,

141
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,075
works at a firm
called Chandler Hinton
down on Wall Street.

142
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,236
Well, that wouldn't be
the first time

143
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,870
some big shot,
hard up for cash,

144
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,006
moonlighted in
the drug biz.

145
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,574
Derek Pfeiffer sounds
Iike our perfect candidate.

146
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,846
Credit report in the dumper.

147
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,218
Filing for bankruptcy
when he miraculously erases

148
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,257
$300,000 in debt.

149
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,951
Sudden windfall?
Benson.

150
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,290
Yeah, Iike the kind you get
from a big drug shipment.

151
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,852
Who says crime doesn't pay?

152
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,022
Yeah.

153
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,130
That was the hospital.

154
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,726
Jawan Hauser died
a half-hour ago.

155
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,566
That's depraved
indifference murder

156
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,698
for whoever smuggled that coke
in those formula cans.

157
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,833
Go talk to Pfeiffer.

158
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,208
If you don't Iike
what he has to say,
bring him in.

159
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,083
I really appreciate
you guys getting that stuff
out of my house

160
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,314
before something bad
happened.

161
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,654
That's no problem.
We just gotta figure out
how it got in your house.

162
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,352
That's easy.
I bought it.

163
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,555
Problem is, there
wasn't another bad
can in that store,

164
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,495
which means
the only two cans
of Iiquid cocaine

165
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,466
on the Upper West Side
were in your pantry.

166
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,104
I wish
I could help you guys.

167
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,833
MUNCH: Take any trips
out of the country
Iately, Derek?

168
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,273
Say, Iike, down Mexico way?

169
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,642
I have clients
all over the world.

170
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,875
That's okay,
you don't have to tell us.
We can check with Customs.

171
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,309
I just got back
from Mexico City
on company business.

172
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,618
Look, it's not good
for me to be seen here

173
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,249
talking to you guys
Iike this in the office.

174
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,816
What a coincidence.
We were gonna suggest

175
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:09,953
that you come down
to our office

176
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,553
and continue
this discussion.

177
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,592
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

178
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,826
Sure you are.

179
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,268
Or you'II be seen
wearing steel when we
drag you out of here.

180
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,128
Is this really necessary?

181
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,072
I have five client meetings
this afternoon.

182
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,337
Believe me,
that's the Ieast
of your problems.

183
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,969
STABLER: Uh-oh.

184
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,070
What's the matter?

185
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,239
I smell a rat.

186
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,441
Big time.

187
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,349
Sergeant Tucker, to what
do we owe this visit
from Internal Affairs?

188
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,478
FIN: Don't forget to salute
or you'II get a 30-day rip.

189
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,544
What are you doing?

190
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,249
Standing here
talking to a friend.

191
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,416
His name Derek Pfeiffer?

192
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,516
What's it to you?

193
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,322
Mr. Pfeiffer's
coming with me.

194
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,692
We got a dead kid
on our hands.

195
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,526
That baby is no Ionger
your concern.

196
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,122
Narcotics dime us?

197
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,134
AII you need to know
is your captain
signed off on it.

198
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,794
Mr. Pfeiffer, my name
is Sergeant Tucker.

199
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,202
You need to come
with me, sir.

200
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,274
Our captain told you
where we were?

201
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,478
What's the deal
with Tucker?

202
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,776
Sergeant Tucker
from IAB?

203
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,839
Yeah, did you send him?

204
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,817
Send him?
What's going on here?
Where's Pfeiffer?

205
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,183
Tucker took him
right out
of our hands.

206
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,119
Said he had your okay.

207
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,785
Let's take a ride.

208
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,320
Captain Cragen,
Detective Stabler.
How can I help you?

209
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,057
You Iying son of a bitch.

210
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,224
Now, it's not enough
you go behind my back
to steal our case.

211
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,200
Now you want my people
thinking I'm in your pocket.

212
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,736
Get off me now.

213
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,896
You don't need
what he can do to you.

214
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,599
Just relax.

215
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,799
I should Iock you up.

216
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,572
Do it. Then explain it
to your bosses.

217
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,203
You need anger
management, Captain.

218
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,009
And you need to kiss my ass.

219
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,049
Where's Derek Pfeiffer?

220
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,447
We questioned him
and Iet him go.

221
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,883
He's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

222
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,544
Any of your people
go near him,

223
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,918
and you'II go
before a trial board.

224
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,149
Good, and then
you can explain

225
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,191
why an infant died
on your watch.

226
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,726
I want to know
what the hell's
going on here.

227
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,556
I don't have to
tell you squat.

228
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,722
IAB investigating
means a dirty cop's
involved.

229
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:52,786
I want a name.

230
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,854
Go to hell.

231
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,062
So, now what's
our next move?

232
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,003
Pick up Derek Pfeiffer.

233
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,631
You really wanna
take on IAB?

234
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,471
Tucker doesn't tell us
how to do our jobs.

235
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,707
Look, EIIiot,
you're following an order
from your CO.

236
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,408
If it gets ugly,
that's what you tell them.

237
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,509
If we hurry,
we can catch Pfeiffer
just Ieaving work.

238
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,719
Hey, Special Victims,
what's up?

239
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,848
Came in as a 34.

240
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,189
Suit, not breathing,
in a bathroom
on the 20th floor.

241
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,421
That's where Pfeiffer works.

242
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,605
BENSON: Damn it.
It's Pfeiffer.

243
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,339
Somebody beat us to him.

244
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,478
MUNCH: Whoever killed Pfeiffer
must've followed him in

245
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,316
and got him
before he closed
the stall door.

246
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,446
Cable he was
strangled with

247
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,354
could've came
from any office
in this building.

248
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,518
Perp could've
brought it in to
make it Iook that way.

249
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,084
This is Keith Gerard.

250
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,289
He's Mr. Pfeiffer's
immediate boss.

251
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,922
Detectives Munch
and Tutuola.

252
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,057
Sorry for your Ioss.

253
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,725
I don't know
how this happens
in a business Iike this.

254
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,702
Building's been
Iocked down tight
since 9/11,

255
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,204
all visitors signed in
and escorted by security.

256
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,764
Probably 10 other ways
to get in,
nothing's foolproof.

257
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,833
Possible one
of Pfeiffer's clients
had it in for him?

258
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,469
If Iosing money
were enough
to set someone off,

259
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,706
we'd all be dead by now.

260
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,077
Derek's desk. Feel free.

261
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,672
Anything unusual about
his behavior Iately?

262
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,445
Derek was under
a Iot of stress.

263
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,951
You mean because of
the market going south?

264
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,612
No, I mean he got demoted.

265
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,677
What happened?

266
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,383
His biggest accounts
Iost millions.

267
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,551
The investors
called for his head
and they got it.

268
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,753
He used to run the floor.

269
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,022
And then
you stepped in.

270
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,121
Believe me, that's not
how I wanted it to happen.

271
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,187
You mind telling us
where you've been

272
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,562
for the Iast
couple of hours?

273
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,295
Sure. Meeting with
the managing partners.

274
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,461
Well, we're gonna
need their names

275
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,060
and a Iist
of Pfeiffer's accounts.

276
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,231
I'II have my assistant
get it for you.

277
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,472
This has gotta be a hit.

278
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,876
They knew Pfeiffer
was talking to us
and they shut him up.

279
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,472
That means his wife's
a target, too.

280
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,316
Derek never would have
been involved with drugs.

281
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,048
We think that
your husband smuggled in

282
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,646
the baby formula
from Mexico.

283
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,350
No, you're wrong.

284
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,189
Did you know your husband
was demoted at work?

285
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,417
No.

286
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,158
Did you know
he filed for bankruptcy?

287
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,566
I knew we were in debt,

288
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,068
but Derek said
he paid everything off.

289
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,369
Bonus for closing
a big deal, he told me.

290
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,369
Mrs. Pfeiffer,
did your husband

291
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,674
ever talk to you
about work?

292
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,045
No, he said he didn't want
to bring the job home

293
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,676
because he worked
so many hours.

294
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,448
Are all those hours
at the office?

295
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,752
He used to entertain clients,

296
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,123
three nights a week,
at the Bear and Bull.

297
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,594
Did you ever meet
any of his
business associates?

298
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:41,360
No, I told you,
Derek didn't want us
in that world.

299
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,368
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

300
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,200
Mrs. Pfeiffer, if your
husband was murdered

301
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,001
because of his
involvement with drugs,

302
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,009
the people who
killed him may think
you know something.

303
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,204
Oh, my God.

304
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,747
Are you telling me
Tommy and I are in danger?

305
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,249
Two detectives are
on their way over here.

306
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,285
They're gonna stay with you.
It's for your own safety.

307
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,376
No.

308
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,146
No, we'II go to
my sister's.

309
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,418
I'II feel more
comfortable there.

310
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,823
Has somebody
threatened you?

311
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,253
Mrs. Pfeiffer?

312
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:21,372
After you were here,
a man knocked on the door.

313
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,035
Said Derek sent him
to pick up the formula.

314
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,306
I told him
I gave it to you,

315
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,506
and he got really upset.

316
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,812
I asked him how he got
past the doorman,

317
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,149
and he showed me his badge.

318
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,752
It's an IAB operation,

319
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,816
and I warned you
to back off.

320
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:42,883
Your detectives...

321
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,327
Were following my orders.

322
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,091
Now who else at IAB
was in on this?

323
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,099
Don't even try
and pin this on me here.

324
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,193
Only five people
in this squad
knew about this case.

325
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,637
Three of us are here,
and the other two
are cleaning up your mess.

326
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,106
Now, I still got
a few friends on this job

327
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,268
who wear stars
on their shoulders.

328
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,336
You wanna tell them
how this went down,
or should I?

329
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,214
Twice, over the Iast year,

330
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,583
Narcotics tried to infiltrate
your baby formula
cocaine ring.

331
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,383
Undercovers got made
both times.

332
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,923
By your dirty cop.

333
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,253
Narcotics thought
it was one of theirs.

334
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,849
That's why they
turned it over to us.

335
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,394
BENSON: And you have
no idea who it is?

336
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,554
We're not sure.

337
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,860
You're not sure
about much, are you?

338
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,661
You know, our D.A.
could've made a deal
with Pfeiffer

339
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,826
to give up your dirty cop

340
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,494
if you hadn't crapped
all over our case.

341
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,060
It's our case, Detective.

342
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,162
Not anymore.

343
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,106
Your people can't handle
this kind of work.

344
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,838
My people do
this kind of work every day.

345
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,675
A baby died
of cocaine poisoning,

346
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,147
and we're damn well
gonna find out
who's responsible.

347
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,205
Now, you wanna help us, fine,

348
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,878
otherwise get the hell
out of our way.

349
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,117
AII right.

350
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,851
What do you need?

351
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,053
Fake IDs, vehicles,
drugs and buy money,
for starters.

352
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,995
You don't make a move
without telling me.

353
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,200
Checked everyone
on the security Iog
at Chandler Hinton.

354
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,437
AII visitors accounted for
and nothing useful
from the canvass.

355
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,035
Pfeiffer's phone records
any help?

356
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,773
Well, the only thing
that stands out

357
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,078
is that whenever Pfeiffer
was at the Bear and Bull,

358
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,846
he always called home
from a pay phone instead
of using his cell.

359
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,318
Sounds Iike
he doesn't want
anyone to know

360
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,581
who else he's calling.

361
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,713
CIassic paranoia.

362
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,985
Could be where he does
his other business.

363
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,321
Hey, there's plenty
of drug activity

364
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,827
down at some of those joints
in the financial district.

365
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,761
Coke to fuel
the high stress jobs.

366
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,992
You're the one with
undercover experience.

367
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,160
I go Iooking to score
in one of them
Wall Street bars,

368
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,466
I might as well
put a sign on my back
that says "cop."

369
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,668
But EIIiot here,
he Iooks Iike the clean-cut
corporate type.

370
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,642
Well, if that's
a compliment,
I'm game.

371
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,542
AII right.
OIivia and Fin
will ghost you.

372
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,637
Munch and I
are backups.

373
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,272
We need to get you
a cover story.

374
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,078
Baby formula scheme's
down the toilet,

375
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,710
so they're gonna be
Iooking for a new way
to bring in the product.

376
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,413
You wanna get
their attention real fast,

377
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,479
you gotta be the solution.

378
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,491
And I gotta be
vulnerable.

379
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,292
Never flash
your buy money.

380
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,160
If they offer to buy,
you know the test.

381
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,559
Snow seals.

382
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,261
There's a quarter gram
of coke in each one.

383
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,996
And take this.

384
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,367
What are you gonna do,
page me?

385
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,929
It's a wire.
If they frisk you,
they'II never suspect it.

386
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,635
Got it from a buddy
in TARU.

387
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,903
We got backup inside.

388
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,945
I'II be out here
recording. Cool?

389
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,306
Yeah.

390
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,187
(SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

391
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,086
How's it going?

392
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,252
What can I get you?

393
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,920
Give me a beer,
that Iast one on the end,

394
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,624
and give the Iady
whatever she's having.

395
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,893
BARTENDER:
Scotch on the rocks?

396
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,991
Yeah.

397
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,057
You got it.

398
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,160
Thank you.

399
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,205
You're welcome.
How you doing?

400
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,705
I'm not bad.
How are you?

401
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:43,897
Better now.

402
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,843
BARTENDER: Here we go.
That'II be 12 bucks.

403
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,773
(LAUGHS)
Sorry about that.

404
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,446
(CHUCKLING)

405
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,978
That any good?

406
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,052
I'II tell you what,
why don't you
just take a Iittle taste

407
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,388
and you tell me?

408
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,624
I can turn you on
to something
a Iittle fresher.

409
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,765
Have a taste.

410
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,028
What's your name?

411
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,965
Donna.

412
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,973
He's talking to somebody
at the end of the bar.

413
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,236
Probably the resident dealer.

414
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,210
And he's coming back.

415
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,912
I'm good. That's for you.

416
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,513
Gentleman down
the end of the bar
would Iike a word with you.

417
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,384
He interested?

418
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,449
Says he'II make it
worth your while.

419
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,604
He's following some guy
into the bathroom.

420
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:53,870
Whoa.

421
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,648
This your idea
of a conversation?

422
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,014
You trying to sell
this crap on my turf?

423
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,109
Who the hell are you?

424
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,175
Who am I?
Yeah.

425
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,846
I'm the guy whose spot
you're parked in.

426
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,857
And I gotta tell you, pal,
I don't Iike competition,
okay?

427
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,722
Wait a minute.
This guy said
you were interested.

428
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,694
This is a big
misunderstanding.

429
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,288
Hey, I don't want
a problem here,
man, really.

430
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,526
So, what's your name?

431
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,727
Here.

432
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,970
Greg EIIiot.

433
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,604
So, Greg, where are you
serving out of?

434
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,104
Building where my office is.

435
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,808
And how much?
How much...

436
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,874
How much quantity?

437
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,178
Three hundred grams
every two weeks, about.

438
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,591
That's... That's impressive.

439
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,648
Yeah.

440
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,751
What are you paying
your supplier?

441
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,852
Ninety.

442
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,021
Ninety.

443
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,565
I'II tell you, Greg,
my people could do better.

444
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,037
My customers Iike
what they're getting.

445
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,538
The stuff I got,
it's top quality.

446
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,639
Okay, I'm Iistening.

447
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,938
Good. Good.

448
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:04,881
Why don't you meet me
tonight at the entrance
to the seaport, say, 8:00?

449
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,477
And bring your money.

450
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,127
Who's he?

451
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,563
Shut up.

452
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,834
Nice to meet you, too.

453
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,307
He's clean.

454
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,545
Still didn't answer
my question.

455
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,683
You got the money?

456
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,876
Wow!

457
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,851
Wow, you wanna show me
the product?

458
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,146
It's a Iittle better
than mine.

459
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,876
Seventy a gram,
introductory offer.

460
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,349
Then we renegotiate.

461
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,477
No, you gotta do
better than that.

462
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,318
Why don't you taste it?

463
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,915
Taste it, because they do
random drug tests
where I work.

464
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,982
I don't do this stuff.

465
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,925
AII right.
AII right. AII right.

466
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,226
Seventy a gram.
Permanent price.

467
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,762
Permanent price. Done.

468
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,808
Hey. Hey.
Take the money.

469
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,309
What're you doing?

470
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,402
You guys, Iook. Hey.

471
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,741
He's got a gun,
Captain.

472
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,371
FIN: Wait a minute.

473
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,574
Everybody, hang tight.

474
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,311
Show me a badge.

475
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,611
Oh.

476
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,711
He's got a gold shield.

477
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,585
STABLER: Look, guys,
Iet's talk about this.

478
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,557
Now he's got
EIIiot's wallet.

479
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,355
What do you say?
You gonna read me
my rights?

480
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,521
You don't got
any rights.

481
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,965
Well, I guess we just
found our dirty cop.

482
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,571
This doesn't Iook
Iike any police station
I've ever seen.

483
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,982
You think
I'm gonna do business
with some dumbass punk?

484
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,042
Are we just gonna
sit here

485
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,382
while they beat
the crap out of him?

486
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,252
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd be dead by now.

487
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,723
What is this?
Some sort of initiation?

488
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,488
The guy with the shield
just wants to show
he's the alpha dog,

489
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,586
to mark his spot.

490
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,028
Your call, Captain.

491
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,430
You see a gun come out,
move. Don't wait.

492
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,765
I hope you didn't
bring me here
just to kick my ass.

493
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,868
Gregory EIIiot,
married, four kids,
house in Forest Hills.

494
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,370
You still got
that gambling problem,
Greg?

495
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,779
What's that?
Your homework assignment?

496
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:59,518
Director of Station Operations
for GIobal Package Express.

497
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,580
What's that mean?

498
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,219
I run our worldwide
shipping stations.

499
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,389
What are you doing?
Putting together my résumé?

500
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,693
Must be
a Iot of travel.

501
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,461
Yeah, I do my share.

502
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,594
I think you're just
the guy we're Iooking for.

503
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,736
Guys, I just sell the stuff,
small quantities.

504
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:17,866
I don't move it.

505
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,035
You do now.

506
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,102
I'm telling you,
I'm selling this

507
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,147
for an old friend of mine,
that's it.

508
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,206
You want Ioyalty,
get a puppy.

509
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,344
I got you with enough blow
for an A-1 felony.

510
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,388
That's Iife
without parole.

511
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,150
You don't think my company
doesn't have safeguards

512
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,021
to prevent people
from doing this sort of thing?

513
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,719
Then you're gonna have to
think outside the box,

514
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,785
Iike they teach you
in business school.

515
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,263
You got till
tomorrow to decide.

516
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,328
Phone number's
on there.

517
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,527
Who's answering?

518
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,431
Call me Kendall.
Oh, one more thing.

519
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,494
Yeah.

520
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,669
That's for the attitude.

521
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,678
Can I have
my wallet?

522
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,590
How's the patient?

523
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,185
Couple of scratches.
He'II Iive.

524
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,560
CRAGEN: What'd you find out?

525
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,428
Brad Kendall's
got 13 years on the job,

526
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,989
nine in Manhattan Narcotics.

527
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,434
He's got more decorations
than you can hang
on a Christmas tree.

528
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,767
Sounds Iike he was
a good cop once.

529
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,136
Nothing Iower
than a commendation,

530
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,572
even got a combat cross.

531
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,576
MUNCH: He walked in
on a gas station robbery,

532
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,077
perps shot at him
and missed.

533
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,237
He killed them both.

534
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,440
Decade of watching
drug dealers
make the big bucks,

535
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,982
guess he wanted
a piece of the action.

536
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,848
If I had went Kendall's route,
I could've been
a rich man by now.

537
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,820
He matches
Laura Pfeiffer's description

538
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,288
of a cop who came Iooking
for baby formula.

539
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,952
We know if Kendall
ever made an appearance
there before?

540
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,324
I spoke to all the doormen
in the building.

541
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,056
It was only that one time.

542
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,496
Which means Pfeiffer
normally delivered
the cocaine to him.

543
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,897
Probably at
the Bear and Bull.

544
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,559
Okay, what about
Kendall's butt boy?

545
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,034
Frank Barry.

546
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,596
Thirty. In and out of prison
on a string of drug collars,

547
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,471
mostly for possession.

548
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,976
Never carried enough weight
to be charged
with intent to sell.

549
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,478
Well, he and Kendall
are soldiers.

550
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,481
There's no way they got
the brains or the muscle
to run an operation Iike this.

551
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,710
We don't even know
how big this thing is.

552
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,310
But there's no way
that Pfeiffer's
their only mule.

553
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,912
Well, Kendall
gave you 24 hours.

554
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,684
That means he's hard up
for product.

555
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,850
If he doesn't
get some soon,

556
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,088
the people that buy
from him are gonna cop
from somebody else.

557
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,924
Get back to Kendall.

558
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,591
Turn up the heat this time,
but meet in a public place.

559
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,759
We don't want
a rerun of tonight.

560
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,509
Why here?

561
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,442
This is where
I do business.

562
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,716
You know, I don't remember
us talking money

563
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,689
while you were
kicking my ass.

564
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,317
I'm Ietting you
stay out of jail.

565
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,623
There's nothing
to talk about.

566
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,098
Oh, no?
Well, what's to stop me
from going to the cops

567
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,568
and telling them
you're shaking me down?

568
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,462
I'm a hero cop.

569
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,001
I mean, who do you think
they're gonna believe?

570
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,010
Then you must think
I am some dumbass punk, huh?

571
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,271
You know what I think?

572
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,108
You're trying
to stay in business.

573
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,784
What, you got
a crystal ball or something?

574
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,311
You need me so bad
you're blackmailing me
to work for you.

575
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,790
That smells
of desperation to me.

576
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,560
I'II tell you what,
hero cop, you're right.

577
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,653
Lock me up.

578
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,961
What do you want?

579
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,334
A third of the profits
of whatever I ship,

580
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,771
after you tell me
why I'm the answer
to your problems.

581
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,741
What's the difference?
It's business.

582
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,778
I don't do business
with Iiars or screw-ups.

583
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,677
(CHUCKLES)

584
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,844
I'II take it to my people.

585
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,909
I don't know
what that means.

586
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,512
What does that mean,
take it to your people?

587
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,387
What, you can't close
the deal?

588
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,450
I mean, doesn't sound
Iike you're very high up
in the food chain.

589
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,053
Maybe I should be talking
to someone who has
a Iittle more juice.

590
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,223
No, you're dealing with me.

591
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,695
Okay.

592
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,469
Have it your way.
You go "talk to your people."

593
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,905
See if they can afford me,

594
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,376
and I'II Iet you know
of my decision.

595
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,538
Try the veal,
it's great.

596
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,154
Okay, I'II call you back
with the details.

597
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,958
What do they want you
to do?

598
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,998
Bring in 10 boxes
of terracotta tiles

599
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,532
made of cocaine base.

600
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,569
Four kilos per box,
each worth $80,000.

601
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,765
My cover story,
I'm retiling my kitchen.

602
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,307
Where's it coming from?

603
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,433
Mexico City.

604
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,712
Gotta find a reason
to get me on down there.

605
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,714
Mexico's a Iittle
out of our jurisdiction.

606
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,250
Not to mention,
out of our Ieague.

607
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,946
Okay, you tell Kendall

608
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,818
you can't make the trip
on such short notice

609
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,220
without arousing suspicion.

610
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,260
Somebody in Mexico City
will make the pickup for you.

611
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,954
Where's the drop?

612
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,357
My alter ego's house
in Forest Hills.

613
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,464
Delivery company
drops off the tiles,

614
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,092
Kendall will come
and pick them up.

615
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,296
We'II have to involve DEA.

616
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,497
They can get us
a cover house

617
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,234
and handle
the pickup in Mexico.

618
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,106
Kendall could be working
with DEA people.

619
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,108
Well, that's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

620
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,821
That's the Iast one, sir.

621
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,415
Thanks a Iot.

622
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,672
This is the most
we've been able
to bring in at one time.

623
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,678
I guess you're saying
you're a satisfied
customer then.

624
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,306
That'II be $267,000.

625
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,111
You wanna count it?

626
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,183
I don't know. Do I need to?

627
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,282
Now Iet's move these.

628
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,385
Honey, are those the tiles?

629
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,227
No, it's a mistake.

630
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,528
They're the wrong ones.
This guy's gonna
exchange them.

631
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,034
He's got ours in his van.
Hey, this is my wife Dana.

632
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,434
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

633
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,801
Baby, you gotta get
in the shower.

634
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,737
We have to be
at Vanessa and GIen's
in Iess than two hours.

635
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,297
Oh, are these the tiles?
STABLER: I don't want to go...

636
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,742
Hey, hey, hey.
What's he doing back here?

637
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,479
Yo, I must've
not signed for it.
He must've made a mistake.

638
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,708
I'II deal with this.

639
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,444
KENDALL: Son of a bitch.

640
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,114
Back off!

641
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,557
Police, Kendall, freeze!

642
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,959
Freeze! Drop the gun!

643
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,622
Drop your gun.

644
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,757
Drop your gun.
Drop your gun!

645
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,198
Drop it!

646
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,034
Drop the...

647
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,980
You okay?
Call the bus.

648
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,749
FIN: 10-13, Manhattan SVU.
We got an officer shot.

649
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:15,384
We're at 6432 99th Street,
Forest Hills, send a bus.

650
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,722
What happened?
He turned around.

651
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,319
I had no choice.
The son of a bitch
just turned on me.

652
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,420
Okay.
He turned on me.

653
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,725
Okay. Take it easy.
He turned on me.

654
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,232
I had no choice.

655
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,528
He wanted me to shoot him.

656
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,967
Son of a bitch
wanted me to shoot him.

657
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,236
Why'd he make me do that?
Why?

658
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,569
He didn't have the guts
to do it himself.

659
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,707
EIIiot, I need your gun.

660
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,410
I know the drill.

661
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,368
STABLER: Upon realizing
he was the target

662
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,766
of our sting operation,

663
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,668
Detective Kendall
pulled his weapon

664
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,764
on Detective Benson
and myself.

665
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:03,830
What happened next?

666
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,136
He ran. I followed.

667
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,370
AIone?

668
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,745
Detective Benson
wasn't armed.

669
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,304
Undercover operation,
it was her call.

670
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,849
But you were armed.
My call.

671
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,384
I didn't trust Kendall.

672
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,579
Are you sure you don't want
your union delegate here?

673
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,678
I've got nothing to hide.

674
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,224
Now how many more times
are we gonna go over this?

675
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,351
Detective Kendall
never fired his weapon,
but you did.

676
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,490
After I identified myself
as a police officer

677
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,193
and ordered Detective Kendall
to drop his weapon,

678
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,259
he turned
and pointed it at me.

679
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,464
Just Iike I told you before.

680
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,904
And how many times
did you fire your weapon?

681
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,034
Two.

682
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,472
Because you saw him
raise his weapon.

683
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,414
To shoot me.

684
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,376
There's nothing else
I could've done.

685
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,056
I'm officially notifying you
you're on modified assignment,

686
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:01,292
restricted to your office
until our investigation
is completed.

687
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,492
You're not to make
any arrests

688
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,161
or interrogate any suspects
until then.

689
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,227
Is that clear, Detective?

690
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,938
The bastard makes me
shoot him,

691
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,480
and I'm the one
under investigation.

692
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,482
EIIiot, maybe you ought to
take a few vacation days.

693
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,518
Not until I find out
who bankrolled Kendall.

694
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,485
I killed him,
I killed our only Iead.

695
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,181
EIIiot, the Iab found
dandruff flakes

696
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,849
on the computer cable
used to strangle
Derek Pfeiffer.

697
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,654
Matches Kendall's DNA.

698
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,422
So Kendall whacked Pfeiffer
to shut him up,

699
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,361
probably on orders
from the top.

700
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,922
With Kendall gone,
we may never find out
who that is.

701
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,525
Well, Kendall
arranged that shipment
of tiles somehow.

702
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,127
Anything on the phones?

703
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,729
Just a few Iocal calls
to family members.

704
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:42,830
Nothing suspicious.

705
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,671
We also took
a prepaid cell off him,
untraceable.

706
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,370
What about his gofer,
Frank Barry?

707
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,572
We haven't found him yet,
but he's too Iow
on the totem pole

708
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,547
to have access
to the top guy.

709
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,447
Maybe Laura Pfeiffer
can fill in the blanks.

710
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,576
BENSON: How?

711
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,210
We found the bad formula
in her kitchen,

712
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,278
we're thinking
Derek brought it in.

713
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,345
But when I called customs

714
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,721
to check on his trips
to Mexico,

715
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,487
we found out
she traveled there, too.

716
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,584
When?

717
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,925
In the Iast three weeks,
five round trips
with her baby,

718
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,521
all on different flights
than her husband.

719
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,965
Doesn't make sense
they would travel
separately every time.

720
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,832
It does if you're
smuggling cocaine
in baby formula cans

721
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,804
and you wanna stay
under the radar.

722
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,738
Mother traveling with a baby.

723
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,675
Customs wouldn't have given
a couple of extra cans
of formula a second thought.

724
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,302
No wonder she refused
our protection.

725
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,676
She's the mule,
not Derek.

726
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:23,907
But Derek's the one
that got whacked,

727
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,415
so he's gotta be in on it.

728
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,884
So question is,
did he or his company
arrange his business trips?

729
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,478
Let's go ask his boss,
Keith Gerard.

730
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,783
I'II go with you.

731
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,124
He was servicing
a Mexican client,

732
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,824
billionaire entrepreneur
who's afraid to fly.

733
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,991
So we go to him.

734
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,556
Fax this to Chicago.
Yes, sir.

735
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,001
Do you usually send a guy
to your billionaire clients

736
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,197
who spends his day
making cold calls?

737
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,833
Look, Derek was
the company's scapegoat

738
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,501
against the bear market.

739
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,566
He shouldn't have Iost
his position,

740
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,340
so I tried
to throw him a bone.

741
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,278
You wanna tell me
what this has to do
with his death?

742
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,806
Derek was smuggling cocaine
on your time and your dime.

743
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,554
Running drugs?
Are you kidding me?

744
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,351
AIong with his wife and son.

745
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,959
I knew it couldn't be true.
You're wrong.

746
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,291
BENSON: And why's that?

747
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,297
Derek and Laura
don't have any children.

748
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,766
If Tommy isn't
the Pfeiffers' child,

749
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,532
then who does he
belong to?

750
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,130
Somebody who needs
the cash so bad

751
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,698
that they're willing
to rent their kid out
as a drug mule.

752
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,745
And Tommy,
or whatever his name is,

753
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,336
he can't be the only one.

754
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,938
So you're thinking
whoever's running this

755
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,915
has a ring of mothers
with babies

756

bringing the coke in.

757
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,343
Well, it's gotta be.

758
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,355
Even if Laura Pfeiffer
brought in three cans
on each of her trips,

759
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,119
it's not enough of a profit
to warrant the risk.

760
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,216
We know where she is?

761
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,282
Yep.

762
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,929
She's staying
with her sister,

00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,718
It's okay.

782
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,154
Come here.

783
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,691
(BENSON GASPS)

784
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,691
Come here. It's okay.

785
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,839
Neighbors hear anything?
FIN: Nada.

786
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,070
CSU found the pillow

787
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,806
the shooter used
to muffle the gunshots.

788
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,245
Any chance
this is Kendall's work?

789
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,474
Unless it's his ghost.

790
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,177
M.E. places time of death
at four to eight hours ago.

791
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,720
Well, somebody's cleaning up
the Ioose ends
Kendall Ieft behind.

792
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:17,982
If that had been
the cartel,

793
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,614
they would've
killed everybody
just to make a point,

794
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,952
including the baby.

795
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,926
Guys, Tommy
was Laura's nephew.

796
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,019
I found his birth certificate

797
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,859
in the dining room credenza
next to this.

798
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,831
PIane ticket
to Mexico perhaps?

799
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,889
Rio, one-way.

800
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,901
Probably so Laura
couldn't be extradited.

801
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,698
This guy's one
cold-blooded customer.

802
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,795
He killed
this baby's mother,

803
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:35,964
he'II do the same
to the others.

804
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,770
So we're on borrowed time,
and the perp's already
two steps ahead of us.

805
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:39,867
Call EIIiot.

806
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,912
Have him start checking
every murder
in the Tri-State

807
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,003
since Kendall was killed.

808
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,073
We're Iooking
for any victims
with an infant.

809
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,843
Yeah. Got it.

810
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,778
Can you tell me
what time it happened?

811
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,152
Whacking mothers
with infants.

812
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,349
Right. Right.
Are you sure...

813
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,755
Yeah, that's what I said.

814
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,316
Any children?
BENSON: Two victims.

815
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:57,918
No, I'm not kidding.
We think there's
gonna be more.

816
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,223
I'm not trying
to be difficult.

817
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,491
Thanks a Iot.

818
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,089
Odafin Tutuola.

819
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,460
Tutuola. You need me
to spell it for you?
Come on.

820
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,333
Call me when you find out.
Thanks.

821
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,963
Got another one.

822
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,065
Where?
Mount Vernon.

823
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,336
Hooker.
Any kids?

824
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,139
They don't have that yet.

825
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,406
What do you mean,
they don't have it?

826
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,005
Munch, I need information.

827
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,106
I'm stuck here.

828
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,447
You guys are the ones
who are out there
trying to find this guy.

829
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,577
You think
I'm just gonna watch?

830
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,677
You need to take a break.

831
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:24,914
You should call
Mount Vernon back

832
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,685
and find out
if the victim had kids.

833
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,349
I brought you
some dinner.

834
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,554
Now is not a good time.

835
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,653
You've got to eat.

836
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,493
I gotta find this guy.

837
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,659
It's after midnight.
Come home, get some rest.

838
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,202
Kathy, I can't Ieave.

839
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,467
OIivia, state police
just found Kendall's
sidekick Frank Barry.

840
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,768
STABLER:
Munch, wait a minute.

841
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,708
Hug the kids. I Iove you.
Thanks for dinner.

842
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,901
Where?

843
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,311
Body washed up
on Jones Beach.

844
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,975
Same MO?
One to the back
of the head.

845
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:57,279
OIivia, grab your coat,
we got another one. Queens.

846
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,993
Hey, Donny,
called your people

847
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,091
as soon
as it came in.

848
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,193
They're in
the Iiving room.

849
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,034
OIivia Benson,
Lieutenant Philly Panzaretti,
Queens Homicide.

850
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,664
Hey, nice to meet you.
What've we got?

851
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,038
Two victims.

852
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,838
Francisco and BIanca FIores.

853
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,436
Lived here
with their Iittle girl,
eight months old.

854
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,537
How's the baby?

855
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,740
Screaming when
patrol showed up,

856
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,077
but otherwise, okay.

857
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,516
EMS took her to EImhurst
to make sure.

858
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,419
CRAGEN: Shooter used a pillow
to muffle the gunshots.

859
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,889
Looks Iike the same MO
as the Staten Island murders.

860
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,653
Except the perp
broke into that house.

861
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,421
There's no sign
anyone forced
their way in here.

862
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,963
So, whoever it was,
the victim knew them.

863
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,464
Looks Iike somebody
worked from home.

864
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,794
Mr. FIores was a gardener.

865
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,233
His truck's parked out back.
Wife did his billing.

866
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,600
Judging from this place,

867
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,902
Mr. FIores wasn't
making any extra money
running drugs.

868
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,874
Or he just hasn't
spent it yet.

869
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:52,967
What'd you find?

870
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,205
An invoice made out
to Keith Gerard.

871
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,279
Mr. FIores
Iandscapes his house.

872
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,839
That's no coincidence.

873
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,942
He's running
this drug operation
from that brokerage house,

874
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,043
he's the top dog.

875
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,520
Renting babies from people
Iike Mr. and Mrs. FIores

876
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,558
who work for him
and need the money.

877
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,856
And now
he's gotta kill them all
so they can't finger him.

878
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,760
Detective Benson,
Captain Cragen.

879
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,458
We need to speak
to Mr. Gerard now.

880
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,591
I'm afraid
he stepped out.

881
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,691
Do you know
where he went?

882
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,498
He said he was going
to the corporate
daycare center.

883
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,595
Where is that?

884
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,299
Right downstairs
on the second floor.

885
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,363
What's going on here?

886
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,568
You Iisten.
Listen very carefully.

887
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,668
If Gerard calls,
you do not tell him
we're here.

888
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,269
You got it?

889
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,021
There's Gerard.

890
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,761
With his next victim.

891
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,029
(SCREAMING)

892
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,595
Drop your weapon.

893
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,695
PIease don't hurt my baby.

894
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,171
Shut up.
Drop it.

895
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,004
Get back.
Get back now or she's dead.

896
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,338
It's over. It's over.

897
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,571
We can all walk away
from this.

898
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,238
I'm Ieaving the building
with her and the kid.

899
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,339
CRAGEN: You're gonna have to
show us some good faith,

900
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,542
all right?

901
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,346
Just Iet them go.

902
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,718
Just Iet them go.

903
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,085
You're gonna watch her die.

904
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,453
CRAGEN: This is between us.

905
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,616
What, you think
I'm an idiot?

906
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,183
Just don't hurt them
and there's a way out.

907
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,592
A way out?

908
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,632
Okay, all right,
Iook, Iet them go.

909
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,861
You can walk
out of here alone.

910
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,092
No cops?

911
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,160
No cops.

912
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,145
Get off,
you're hurting me.

913
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,687
Yeah. That's tough.

914
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,285
I can make you
both rich.

915
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,019
Yeah? You better save it
for the fancy Iawyer
you'II need

916
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,152
to appeal
the death penalty.

917
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,694
D.A.'s office
isn't gonna drag you
before the grand jury,

918
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,533
and IAB cleared you.

919
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,640
In two days, how?

920
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:07,905
Incentive.

921
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,674
Spare themselves
the embarrassment
in the press.

922
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,051
What did it cost you?

923
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,152
Not nearly what it was worth.

924
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,163
I'II see you tomorrow.

925
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,601
BENSON: Good night, Captain.

926
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,729
How'd it go?

927
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:35,897
We got them all.

928
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,572
Ten other mothers.

929
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,444
Gerard paid
each mother 20 grand
to rent those babies.

930
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,976
Good job.

931
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,311
They making you
see the shrink?

932
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,818
Yeah.

933
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,046
You been there?

934
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,520
Not yet.

935
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,152
I thought I was okay, too,
when I shot that guy.

936
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,463
But even a Iowlife
Iike Kendall's
gonna stay with you.

937
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,159
I gotta get home.

938
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,430
Thanks.

939
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,098
How Iong has that sandwich
been sitting there?

00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,541
I got busy. It's all yours.

941
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:14,669
You sleeping?

942
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,734
Yeah.

943
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,918
Seeing that shrink,
did that help?

944
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,419
Not much.
