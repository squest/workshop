1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,170
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,870
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,139
In New York City,

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,011
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,609
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,711
These are their stories.

7
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,818
So what kinds of things
do you Iike to draw, Chloe?

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,984
Cats.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,550
Cats?
I Iike cats.

10
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:34,462
You know, your teacher
showed me a really
great picture that you drew.

11
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,627
Is that your family?
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,341
Are you
in this picture?

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,270
That's me
and that's Mommy
and Kyle.

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,005
You Iook sad
in this picture.
Are those tears?

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,347
Why are you crying?

16
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,884
Kyle is your brother?

17
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,891
He's my half-brother.

18
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,052
Oh, 'cause
you guys have
different moms, right?

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,187
We have the same daddy.
Daddy?

20
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,698
There's no daddy
in this picture.
Where's he?

21
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,960
He's out of town.

22
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,501
Is that
why you're sad?

23
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,695
No.

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,397
Okay. Chloe,

25
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,708
are you sad
'cause someone's
hurting you?

26
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,870
I don't know.

27
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,948
Usually Chloe's
very happy, outgoing,

28
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,883
but Iately
she's been withdrawn.

29
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,716
And I've noticed
some bruises
on her Iegs.

30
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,949
Okay, once
Detective Benson's
finished talking with her

31
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,219
we'II need to take her
to the hospital
for an exam.

32
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,727
The father's
a Iittle high-strung.
What do I tell him?

33
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,286
We'II send an officer
here to meet him,
bring him to the hospital.

34
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,422
What do you mean,
high-strung?

35
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,265
A yeller. You know,
corporate mogul type,
Lawrence Fuller.

36
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,330
Fuller Telecom?
Yeah.

37
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,463
Guy's name
is on my cable bill.

38
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:50,737
Well, you should probably
also know that Chloe's
mother is GIoria Stanfield.

39
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,143
The actress.
She did a few movies
about 10 years ago.

40
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,476
So you're asking
for discretion.

41
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,278
No, I'm just giving you
fair warning.
They're both a handful.

42
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:03,118
Chloe, your mom
and Kyle Iook
really happy here, huh?

43
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,392
How come you're
the only one
that's sad?

44
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,156
Because Mommy
Ioves Kyle
more than me.

45
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,695
I bet she Ioves you
both the same.

46
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,793
She reads him stories
all the time,
but not to me.

47
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,406
Where does she
read Kyle stories?

48
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,941
In his room.

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,402
They close the door
and I'm not allowed.

50
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,412
You never
went in there?
Not one time?

51
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,650
It was because
I heard noises.

52
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,583
I thought
Mommy was crying.

53
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,390
What were they doing?

54
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,825
They were
playing in bed.

55
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,895
They didn't have
any clothes on.

56
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,117
The colposcopic exam
didn't reveal any signs
of sexual abuse.

57
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,286
Anything that indicates
straight physical abuse?

58
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,761
Some bruises
on her shins.

59
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,991
Pretty typical
for a five-year-old.

60
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,261
Scan showed healed wrist
and tibia fractures,

61
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,065
but she doesn't remember
how she got them.

62
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,126
You talk
to the parents yet?

63
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,469
Actually, we're gonna wait
till we speak with Chloe.

64
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,944
Yeah, well, I think that's
her father, and he Iooks
Iike he wants to go.

65
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,213
Are you the detectives
who brought my daughter here?

66
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,012
Is she all right?
She's fine, Mr. Fuller.

67
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,315
Why don't we go someplace
where we can discuss it
more privately?

68
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,252
School tells me
I have to go
to the hospital.

69
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,586
No one tells me why.
Is Chloe hurt?

70
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,149
No. No, but there was
some concern
at her school.

71
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,626
Concern about what?

72
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,187
She said some things
that might indicate
problems at home.

73
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,358
What kind of problems?

74
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,527
Actually, we were hoping
that you could help us
with that.

75
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,333
When did Chloe
break her wrist
and her Ieg?

76
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:37,536
When she was three.
She fell off a slide
in a playground.

77
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,738
Is that what this is about?
It was an accident.

78
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,838
You dragged her
to a hospital for that?

79
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,407
We brought her here
based on a picture
she drew at school

80
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,387
and statements
she made to
Detective Benson

81
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,319
which seemed to

82
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,294
describe a sexual
relationship between
your wife and your son.

83
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,295
What are you
talking about?
What kind of picture?

84
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:04,962
Your daughter said
she'd seen them sleeping
in the same bed together.

85
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,836
Are you out of your mind?
She's his mother.

86
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,398
BENSON: Do you think that
Chloe made it up?

87
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,871
She had to. I...

88
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,470
Where's your wife
now, Mr. Fuller?

89
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,573
Our house in the Hamptons,
antique shopping.

90
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,381
Have you ever seen
any behavior that
confirms Chloe's story?

91
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,382
I don't think so.

92
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,157
But you damn well better believe
I'II be finding out.

93
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,319
Sir, it's really
best if you allow us
to investigate.

94
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,694
You investigate all you Iike.
I'm taking Chloe home.

95
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,171
Kyle Fuller's school
records describe a normal,
well-adjusted kid,

96
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,832
till the second grade
when his mother was
killed in a car accident.

97
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,603
Not surprising
he had a tough time.

98
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,166
In the fifth grade
his behavior got worse.

99
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,475
Loss of appetite,
sudden outbursts,
fighting.

100
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,743
That was the same year
his father married
GIoria Stanfield.

101
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,648
Well, it could be
adjusting to a stepmother.

102
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,586
Or the stepmother
pulled a Woody AIIen
way back then.

103
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,624
Proving that's the only way
we're gonna charge her
with statutory rape.

104
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,818
It's not illegal to have
sex with a 17-year-old.

105
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,417
He turned 17 Iast month.

106
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,020
You don't think
it's Iikely that the abuse
started Iong before that?

107
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,532
Doesn't matter what
I think if they're not
breaking the Iaw.

108
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,037
Even if the abuse started
yesterday, she's still
essentially his mother.

109
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,369
She's taking advantage
of her control over him.

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,069
Unless he's a normal teenager
who's just happy to be
banging an actress.

111
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,509
Look, if nothing else,

112
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,809
that environment
is unhealthy
for that Iittle girl.

113
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,679
Well, this all depends
on whether we believe
what she's saying is true.

114
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,775
BENSON: And I do.

115
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,151
Kids her age
don't usually make up
things Iike this.

116
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,585
When is the mother
due back in town?

117
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,354
Anytime, if she gets word
we're Iooking at her.

118
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,362
She's gonna want to circle
the family wagons.

119
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,422
Well, I'd Iike to know
if we have a complaining
witness before that happens.

120
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,832
Fin, you and John
go talk to Kyle.

121
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,837
If he is a victim, he may
want to know there's something
he can do to stop it.

122
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,204
You know, a family
Iike this probably has
plenty of hired help.

123
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,470
Something's going on
in that house,
they'd know about it.

124
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,034
AII right, discretion,
everybody.

125
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,774
The Ionger we keep this
out of the papers,
the better.

126
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,084
Kyle Fuller.
Can we talk to you
alone for a minute?

127
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,547
I'II see you guys Iater.
Yeah.

128
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,753
What's this about?

129
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,728
You talk to
your father today?

130
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,766
No, I won't see him
till tonight. Why,
did something happen?

131
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,802
He's fine.
How things going
for you at home?

132
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,136
Okay. Why?

133
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,431
Get along with
your mother?

134
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,168
My stepmother?

135
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,938
She's all right.
Why are you asking
about her?

136
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,606
One of our detectives
talked to your sister Chloe.

137
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,410
We're with the
Special Victims Unit.

138
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,646
One of the things
we investigate
is child abuse.

139
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,146
You think Chloe's
being abused?

140
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,019
FIN: No, not Chloe. You.

141
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,351
She told you that?

142
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:44,021
She said you and your
stepmother sleep
in the same bed. Is that true?

143
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,793
Okay, wait.

144
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,995
Wait. If you think
that we're sleeping together,

145
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:55,098
Iike, having sex,
that's just sick.

146
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,541
I mean, GIoria's been
my stepmom since I was,
Iike, 10.

147
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,478
And you don't wanna
get her into trouble.
We understand that.

148
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,574
No. It's just that
there's no way that
we're sleeping together

149
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,243
or having sex
or anything.

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,689
I mean, if that's
what Chloe told you,
Iook, I'm sorry, I really am.

151
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,225
I'm sorry you came down here
and wasted your time,

152
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,454
but it's just not true.

153
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,124
Okay?

154
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,795
Detectives,
I've told you three times,

155
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,468
my employment contract
includes a
confidentiality clause.

156
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,704
Meaning
you know something,
you just can't say.

157
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,075
That's not what I mean.

158
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,909
Do you get along with
Ms. Stanfield?

159
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,815
She's an excellent employer,
and that's all I will say.

160
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,580
Well, what do they
pay you for
a gig Iike this?

161
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,348
That's none
of your concern.

162
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,413
I'II bet there are
a Iot of under-the-table
cash transactions.

163
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,685
Is that true?

164
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,057
Well, we could find out.
Drop a dime to the IRS,

165
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,564
have them go through
your undeclared cash income
with a fine-toothed comb.

166
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,532
That would jam her up for,
what, about three years?

167
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,794
Minimum.

168
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,231
We find truth in
what Chloe is saying,
your boss is going down.

169
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,742
You'd better
decide right now.
You want to join her?

170
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,806
I saw them together once,
a few weeks ago.

171
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,246
Doing what?

172
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,351
I walked into the room.

173
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,114
She was kissing Kyle.

174
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,381
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

175
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,322
It wasn't the way
a mother kisses her son.

176
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,122
Benson.
It was only a moment.

177
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,491
I hardly saw anything.

178
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,053
It sounds Iike
you saw plenty.

179
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,359
BENSON: Thanks.

180
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,027
GIoria Stanfield's
back in town.
At her Iawyer's office.

181
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,502
Our presence
is kindly requested.

182
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,704
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Detectives.

183
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,646
You must know my client,
GIoria Stanfield.

184
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,839
Heard a Iot about you.

185
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,044
GLORIA: I'II be with you
in a minute.

186
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:51,351
She wanted to clear
this matter up as soon
as she got back to town.

187
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,448
STABLER: How were
the Hamptons?

188
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,617
Dull.

189
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,521
I know the other detectives
already spoke to Kyle.

190
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,689
He told you the truth.

191
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,222
I am not having
a sexual relationship
with my stepson.

192
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,166
What more
can I tell you?

193
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,206
You think Chloe
Iied about it?

194
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,040
I think she
makes up stories.
She's a child.

195
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,341
Well, then,
why do we have
other adult witnesses

196
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:18,474
who describe
a pretty passionate kiss
between you and your stepson?

197
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,644
I kiss everyone,
Detective.

198
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,650
The simple fact
is you're investigating

199
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,920
the misconception of
an imaginative five-year-old.

200
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,596
Where do you think
Chloe got these ideas from?

201
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,030
Television, probably.
My old movies,
for that matter.

202
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,995
You know, this is
really ridiculous.

203
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,698
Chloe draws a picture,
and everyone blows it
out of proportion.

204
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,038
I would never do anything
to hurt my stepson.

205
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,875
No complaining witness,
no physical evidence of abuse,

206
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:53,112
no independent verification
other than an
uncooperative housekeeper

207
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,915
who saw a stepmother
kiss her stepson.

208
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,718
And no indictment
based on a
kindergartner's art project.

209
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,986
There's something
going on in that house.

210
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,118
That woman's wrong.

211
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,889
We're gonna need more
than your gut.

212
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,454
I can contact my counterpart
at Children's Services.

213
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,500
At the very Ieast,
they can start
a file on GIoria.

214
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,967
I just got a call
from a patrol
out of the 22

215
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,801
responding to
a domestic disturbance
at the Formby Day School.

216
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:14,999
What happened?

217
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,976
GIoria and her husband
are fighting over
who's taking the daughter.

218
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,672
You Iet me take
my daughter home
right now

219
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,976
or I will slap a Iawsuit
on you so fast...
Don't Iet him near her.

220
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,778
You see
how angry he gets.

221
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,909
Shut up.
She raped my son.

222
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,113
God knows what she did
to my daughter.
Our daughter.

223
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,679
Look, you don't deserve
to be a mother.
You're disgusting.

224
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,951
Yeah, make up
some more stories.

225
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,051
Everyone knows it's so you can
get out of child support
when I divorce you!

226
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,291
I'm gonna kill you
if you touch my children!
Mr. Fuller!

227
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,596
I don't want to hear
another threat Iike that.
Now, am I clear?

228
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,102
Yeah.
You say I'm the abuser.

229
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,369
He hits me and he hits them.
You should investigate that!

230
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,467
You two
can fight this out
in Family Court.

231
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,876
Until then,
your children will be
in the custody of the state.

232
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,379
What?
You can't do that!

233
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,281
If we think your children
are in imminent danger,
we certainly can.

234
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,979
If they keep at it,
bring them in
for disorderly conduct.

235
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,215
FULLER: Oh, no, no, no.
Chloe, sweetheart.

236
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,279
Wait a minute.

237
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,648
Baby.

238
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,784
FULLER: No.
It's okay.

239
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,259
This is kidnapping!

240
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,764
Munch, I need you to do
an emergency removal
of Kyle Fuller.

241
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,197
Pick him up at his school.

242
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,200
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

243
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,105
You guys are friends
of Kyle Fuller, right?

244
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,663
You seen him?

245
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,835
He Ieft already.
What are you guys
investigating?

246
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,675
Kyle get along okay
with his family?
His stepmom?

247
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,181
Yeah, he and GIoria
got along really well.

248
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,477
How do you know?

249
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,575
Well, everybody knows
about GIoria.

250
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,916
She's very open.

251
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,118
What, is she putting out
for all his school buddies?

252
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,023
Not that. She just Iikes
having guys around.

253
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,560
She doesn't mind,
you know,
if you Iook at her.

254
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,324
Yeah, it's Iike she's
wearing clothes, but you can
totally see through them.

255
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,524
And she's always giving
everybody backrubs.

256
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,726
And what does
Kyle think of all this?

257
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,961
He digs it.

258
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,764
It's not his real mom,
so who cares?

259
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,771
It sounds Iike you think
there's more going on

260
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,774
than just backrubs
and peep shows.

261
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,778
I don't know
if he's banging her,
but I wouldn't be surprised.

262
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,241
Where's the Iittle one?

263
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,718
ACS placed her
with an aunt
and uncle in the area.

264
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,518
Well, Iet's all hope
insanity isn't
a family trait.

265
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,818
Any Iuck with Kyle?

266
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,291
No. Not at home,
not with friends.

267
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,456
Munch and Fin are still
out Iooking, and your day
isn't over yet.

268
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,639
Doorman called it in.
No witnesses.
Nobody heard a struggle.

269
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,233
Where's the rest
of the Addams family?

270
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,938
MIA.
Forced entry?

271
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,277
Door was ajar,
Iocks intact.

272
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,943
Whoever did this
knew the security code.
There's no apparent robbery.

273
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,283
Bashed in
his skull, Ieft.

274
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,096
BIow to the back of the head's
probably what did it,

275
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,727
but he's got impact
wounds to the torso,
thighs, forearms.

276
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,963
Went down fighting.

277
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,405
Murder weapon Iooks Iike
it's cylindrical, two
or three inches in diameter.

278
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,736
MUNCH: Like a baseball bat?

279
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,174
That'd do it.

280
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,436
I found it
under Kyle's bed.
I'II bag it for prints.

281
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,314
Fin's talking to
the doorman to see
if Kyle Ieft in a hurry.

282
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,375
Mr. Fuller came in
around 8:00.

283
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,149
After about 20 minutes,
Ms. Stanfield Ieft,

284
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,691
then Kyle about
15 minutes Iater.

285
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,522
Did you notice
anything unusual
about either of them?

286
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,462
Ms. Stanfield
was in a hurry,
but that's typical.

287
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,967
Kyle. I guess
he seemed a Iittle upset.

288
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,292
Where are
the other entrances?

289
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,394
Back and side doors,

290
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,996
but they're all Iocked
and hooked up
to the alarm system.

291
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,702
And no one enters
without signing in.

292
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,007
Pretty quiet today.
Nobody out of the ordinary.

293
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,775
Just guests of the tenants.

294
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,578
Okay. I'm gonna
get this back to you, okay?

295
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,218
What's going on?

296
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,916
Your father was killed.

297
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,425
Somebody attacked him
in your apartment.
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,926
Where's GIoria?

299
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,968
Well, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

300
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,663
You're taking
your father's death
kind of well, though.

301
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,103
Come on.

302
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,605
It's my day off.

303
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,199
I stopped by
to check on
Ms. Stanfield

304
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,438
and the front door was open.

305
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,481
I came in,
found Mr. Fuller.

306
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,743
Why were you
checking on
Ms. Stanfield?

307
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,012
She called
after you took Chloe.

308
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,749
She was so upset.
I wanted to make sure
she was all right.

309
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,489
You know where
she was calling from?

310
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,321
I assumed here.

311
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,227
There was no one else
in the apartment.

312
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,960
She couldn't have done this,
Detective. It's not possible.

313
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,226
MUNCH: How'd you get
that shiner?

314
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,703
At school, in Phys Ed.

315
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,296
It Iooks Iike
you got punched.

316
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,465
Thought it might be
your dad.

317
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,565
MUNCH: Is that what happened?

318
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,371
He started to hit you
and you defended yourself?

319
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,502
No.

320
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,874
I didn't kill him.

321
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,313
Any idea who did?

322
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,651
Where'd you go tonight?

323
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,577
For a walk.

324
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,680
MUNCH: Why?

325
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,122
Because I felt Iike it.

326
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,422
Your dad and stepmom
were home
before you Ieft.

327
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:06,055
That's gotta be a pretty
contentious relationship
these days, huh?

328
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,792
I don't know anything
about it.

329
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:11,063
Okay, you went out
for a walk.
Where'd GIoria go?

330
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,932
She didn't kill him.

331
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,099
FIN: Well, how do you know?
You went out for a walk.

332
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,266
I just know.

333
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,575
How many school uniforms
do you have?

334
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,642
About six.
Where's the one
you wore today?

335
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,049
I changed when I got home.

336
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,577
BIood stains kind of clash
with the school colors, huh?

337
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,852
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

338
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,257
Detectives.

339
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,269
Hold off
on the questions
for a minute.

340
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,328
Why?
Kid Iawyered up.

341
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,868
Mr. Schaefer,
if you'II follow me
to interrogation.

342
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,575
You're not worried about
a conflict of interest there,
Counselor?

343
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,549
Ms. Stanfield
is a suspect also.

344
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,553
If charges are filed,
Kyle obtains new counsel.

345
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,385
Until then,
no conflict.

346
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,890
Who's representing you?

347
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,484
I'II answer any questions
you have without
my attorney present.

348
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,290
I'm gonna advise you
against that.

349
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,730
No. Really, it's okay.
I haven't got anything
to hide.

350
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,324
Right this way.

351
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,236
I have no idea what happened.
I went to a hotel tonight.

352
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,466
STABLER: Why?

353
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,168
You saw my husband
at the school.

354
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,337
Do you honestly think
I wanted to be anywhere
near that man?

355
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,643
BENSON: Well, then
why go home at all?

356
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,548
Well, Detective Benson,
to get my things.

357
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,444
My stepson was there.

358
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,489
I tried to explain to him
what was happening.

359
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,957
Kyle got so angry,

360
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,016
and then Lawrence walked in.

361
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,755
They started fighting.

362
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,889
Lawrence got physical,
as usual, pushed him.

363
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,126
I couldn't stand it
anymore so I Ieft.

364
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,568
You Ieft your husband
to push around your stepson?

365
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,469
How would I stop him?

366
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,302
Believe me, I've tried.
It only makes things worse.

367
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,278
Will the hotel
confirm your story?

368
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,474
The Sienna.
They'II tell you
when I checked in.

369
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,074
Is that all?

370
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,277
One more thing.

371
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,347
Was your husband
still breathing
when you Ieft?

372
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,653
I didn't kill him.

373
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,420
I have no reason.

374
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,623
Well, actually,
I could think of a couple.

375
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,825
Custody of the kids.
Inheriting his money.

376
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,767
Lawrence made me sign
a prenuptial agreement.

377
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,432
He always believed
that I was a gold digger
at heart.

378
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:34,446
The money goes to
Kyle and Chloe in trusts that
I am not allowed to touch.

379
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,108
So when you Ieft
Kyle and his father
were still fighting?

380
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,182
Kyle didn't do this.

381
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,982
But you'd already Ieft,
so you don't know
that for sure.

382
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,853
Look, I will answer
any questions
that you have about me,

383
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,859
but I just Iost my husband
and my daughter.

384
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,293
I'm not gonna help you
frame my stepson.

385
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,666
CABOT: Anyone Iook good
for the arrest?

386
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,101
Well, one's covering
for the other.
I'm just not sure who.

387
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,264
The murder weapon was found
under the boy's bed.

388
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,865
I'm guessing GIoria Stanfield
doesn't have a baseball bat.

389
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,001
Well, doesn't mean
she didn't borrow it.

390
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,602
Kyle came back
to the crime scene.

391
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,670
If he killed the guy,
why the hell
didn't he stay away?

392
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,741
Maybe to pick up
the murder weapon.
Only one set of prints on it.

393
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,611
Kyle Fuller's.

394
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,155
Arrest him.

395
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,255
We have been more than
cooperative, so if you're not
planning on arresting Kyle...

396
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,921
Stand up.
Why?

397
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,363
Because we're planning
on arresting you.

398
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,127
For what?
The murder
of Lawrence Fuller.

399
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,999
Come on, Iet's not
make this any harder.

400
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,031
You have the right
to an attorney.

401
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,438
You want my advice,
don't take one that's
on your mother's payroll.

402
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,806
You're making a mistake.
My son is innocent.

403
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,276
You're the only
other suspect,

404
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,813
so if you got a confession,
now's the time to give it.

405
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,542
I'II have him out
by morning.

406
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,605
Kyle, don't say
anything.

407
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,708
I won't.

408
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,980
I'm getting you a Iawyer.
I'II take care of everything.

409
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,215
Don't tell them
anything.

Not guilty.

I'II hear the People
on bail.

416
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,702
The defendant has
unlimited financial means
at his disposal

417
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,007
and no business
or familial responsibilities.

418
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,014
We consider him to be
a flight risk and request
remand, Your Honor.

419
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,141
He is a 17-year-old boy

with strong ties
to his stepmother
and his five-year-old sister.

he's not a flight risk,
Your Honor.

424

CABOT: The defendant
is charged with
viciously beating

his father to death
with a baseball bat.

426
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,894
This is a first arrest.
He is no hardened criminal.

Bail is set at $1,000,000,

and we'II also hold onto
Mr. Fuller's passport

of the trial.

Take him
all of five seconds

434
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,213
He didn't pull
this off alone.

435
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,619
Find me some evidence and
I will charge GIoria Stanfield
as a co-conspirator.

436
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,589
First place
I'd Iike to Iook
is her hotel room.

437
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,489
I can't send you
on a fishing expedition.

438
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,460
The judge is going to
want to know
what you're Iooking for.

439
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,359
Kyle's school uniform.

440
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,059
If he was wearing it
when he killed Fuller, it's
gotta have blood all over it.

441
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,728
He had to stash it
somewhere.

442
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,600
I'II get a warrant.

443
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,207
GIoria Stanfield's room,
please.

444
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,647
I'm sorry,
I can't give
that out.

445
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,775
This says
you can.

446
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,845
I can give you the room,
but she's not in right now.

447
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,720
Well, do you know
where she went?

448
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,353
DESK CLERK: I arranged for
a car to JFK. They didn't say
where they were going.

449
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,364
They? She had
her son with her?

450
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,900
He was young,
but I'm sure
he wasn't her son.

451
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,198
Not the way
they were acting.

452
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,203
Anything from
the passenger manifests?

453
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,674
We're calling on domestic
flights. There are over 70
airlines that fly out of JFK.

454
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,267
Well, there's no activity
on her credit card,

455
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,246
so if they flew,
they must've paid cash
for the tickets.

456
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,217
Departed on FIight 1647
to Dulles, 11:00 this morning.

457
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,650
DC? What the hell
they doing there?

458
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,984
Thanks.
They're already back.

459
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,490
They Ianded at JFK
two hours ago.

460
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,353
The other officers
have already searched
the room.

461
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,918
How many times
do you need to see it?

462
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,827
Till we find
what we're Iooking for.

463
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,593
Don't worry about it.
The warrant's
still valid.

464
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,224
The guests may be inside.

465
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,826
You know what?
Let's surprise them.

466
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,473
BENSON: NYPD.
Come on out, Kyle.

467
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,841
KYLE: Don't come in here!

468
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,843
We got a warrant to search
this room, and we're going
to start with the bed.

469
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,648
Hey, you forget that
Iittle detail about
not Ieaving this jurisdiction?

470
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,484
You blew it, buddy.

471
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,551
We didn't do
anything wrong.

472
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,057
BENSON: Yeah, you did.

473
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,787
So get up, get dressed,

474
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,489
and have your Iawyer meet you
down at the station.

475
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,728
We don't have to say
anything to you.
We're married now.

476
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,738
Where's Kyle?

477
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,272
In a cell at the courthouse,
waiting for a judge
to revoke his bail,

478
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,648
send his ass to Rikers.

479
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,744
Explain this to me.

480
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:14,554
You're questioning my client
because she was in bed
with her husband?

481
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,459
Who, up until yesterday,
was her stepson.

482
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,225
You want to tell us again
how you never abused him,
GIoria?

483
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,423
SCHAEFER: He's 17 years old.
It's not abuse.

484
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:26,130
You expect us to believe
that she waited until it was
Iegal to sleep with him?

485
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:29,662
Well, unless you have evidence
to the contrary,
you have to believe it.

486
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,538
I never abused him.

487
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,268
We're in Iove.

488
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,907
You're in Iove with a boy
you've raised since
he was 10 years old?

489
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,816
Sweetheart,
that's not Iove,
that's pedophilia.

490
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:44,049
Nothing happened
until after he was 17.

491
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,555
A month ago.

492
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,061
You must've given him
one hell of a
birthday present, GIoria.

493
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,391
I'II take
the blame for it.

494
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,290
I was Ionely.

495
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:00,327
My husband was never home.
He hadn't touched me
in over a year.

496
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,903
Kyle knew I was hurt.

497
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:08,612
He only wants me to be happy,
and I want the same thing
for him.

498
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,308
What happened between us
may be wrong in your eyes,

499
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,442
but we can't help
the way we feel.

500
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:17,010
The detectives will explain
to you that you've done
nothing wrong at all.

501
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,285
You're not blood-related.
There's no crime.

502
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,920
So the widow Stanfield
marries her stepson

503
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,053
right in the middle
of a murder investigation.

504
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,691
Now neither one of them
has to testify against
each other in a court.

505
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,064
It's a huge coincidence.

506
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,003
Spousal privilege protects
the sanctity of marriage,
Detectives.

507
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:39,237
Well, it also protects them
from telling the truth about
who killed Lawrence Fuller.

508
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,477
During the course
of their investigation,

509
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,714
SVU detectives discovered
the defendant
Ieft his jurisdiction,

510
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,619
violating the conditions
of his bail agreement.

511
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,352
This was obviously
not an attempt to skip bail,
Your Honor,

512
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,554
as evidenced by the fact
that my client was on his way
back to New York

513
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,494
before the detectives
knew he was gone.

514
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,499
The sole purpose
of this trip was to travel
to the state of Virginia,

515
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,797
which allows non-residents
to obtain marriage Iicenses

516
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,600
without waiting periods
or blood tests.

517
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,371
He skipped town
to get married?

518
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,808
Virginia also allows
a person
under the age of 18

519
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,846
to marry with the permission
of a Iegal guardian,

520
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,440
despite the fact that
the defendant was, in fact,
marrying his Iegal guardian,

521
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,314
his stepmother,
GIoria Stanfield,

522
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,785
currently under investigation
for child abuse and murder.

523
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,379
None of this is relevant
to the matter of bail,
Your Honor.

524
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,017
But it is relevant
to the defendant's trial.

525
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,618
This marriage is an attempt
to abuse spousal privilege

526
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,096
and circumvent the very
investigation which may Iand
the defendant in jail.

527
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,623
Whether or not the defendant
intended to avoid prosecution,

528
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,034
he violated
his bail agreement.

529
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,539
Bail is revoked.
Defendant is remanded.

530
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,599
Congratulations
on your nuptials,
young man.

531
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,749
CABOT: Get anything
from the blushing bride?

532
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,408
She's sticking
to her story.

533
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,147
Nothing happened
until after
he turned 17.

534
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,985
Cut her Ioose.
We sure the marriage
is valid?

535
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,991
According to the
Virginia State Attorney's
office.

536
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,994
There is nothing on the books
preventing a minor
from marrying a stepparent.

537
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,222
It's perfectly Iegal.

538
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,521
And newsworthy.

539
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,762
Did GIoria Stanfield
abuse her children?

540
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,305
Is the district attorney
planning to indict her
for her husband's murder?

541
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,362
CABOT: We have no comment.

542
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,908
Hey, does GIoria Stanfield's
pregnancy

543
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,568
have any effect on
the child abuse allegations?

544
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,668
Who told you that?

545
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,007
I'm not
at Iiberty to say.

546
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,377
Let me talk to you
a second.
Hey, hey, hey...

547
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,575
Right over here.
I won't reveal my sources.

548
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,313
You know what?
Don't give me
this intimidation crap.

549
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,651
First Amendment, kids.
I'm a journalist.

550
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,624
For the National Probe.
That's a real
respectable publication.

551
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,093
You guys are just pissed
because I got the goods
before you.

552
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,959
What'd you do?
Stake out her
doctor's office?

553
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,827
Bribe some receptionist
for her medical records?

554
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,367
AII I'm saying is,
she's knocked up.
Three months along.

555
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,198
And that stepson of hers
is the father.

556
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,396
How do you know that?

557
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,769
Because she brought him
with her to the appointment.

558
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,401
Use your brains, honey.
Why else would
she marry the kid?

559
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,614
Heard you're gonna be
a daddy. That true?

560
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,416
Don't answer that.
Why the hell not?

561
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,390
Whatever his answer is,
it doesn't incriminate him,
just his mother.

562
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,756
GIoria is my wife.

563
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,920
Look at him.
Know what that is?

564
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,054
Fatherly pride.

565
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,256
FIN: Kid's yours, then?

566
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:17,734
My client has no way
of knowing the paternity
of GIoria Stanfield's child.

567
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,667
But it's possible,
right?

568
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,196
Ask him something
he can actually answer
or we're done.

569
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:28,035
Did she tell you
that was your baby?
Is that why you got married?

570
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,318
Anything GIoria told me was
after we were married.

571
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,616
That means
I don't have to
answer your question.

572
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,025
Thank you, Detective Benson.
And they say chivalry's dead.

573
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:51,033
You shopping for
your husband's funeral
or maternity clothes?

574
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,296
Little bit of both.

575
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,304
We wanted to offer
our congratulations
to you.

576
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,862
And you're bringing me
a present.

577
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,398
Yep. Paternity test
paid for by the state.

578
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,501
Why?

579
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,944
I think
you can guess.

580
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,881
So you can prove
I had sex with Kyle
before he was 17.

581
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,008
Do I have a choice?

582
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,677
You can wait
until the baby is born.

583
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:09,742
We can get a court order,

584
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,652
but that means you have
six more months of visits

585
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,317
to Iook forward to
from Detective Benson
and myself

586
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,882
just to make sure
you don't get Iost.

587
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,485
Contact my attorney.
He'II set up the test.

588
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,194
Congratulations.
It's a boy.

589
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,898
Not what we
wanted to know.

590
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,667
Makes the paternity testing
a Iot easier.

591
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,834
Only have to compare
the Y-chromosomes.

592
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,673
Got Lawrence Fuller's
DNA from the morgue.

593
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,542
He and Kyle
have the same Y.

594
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,807
Then so should
the baby.

595
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,849
No. Chromosomes
don't match.

596
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,111
Benson.

597
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,185
Somebody else
is the father.

598
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,346
Thanks.

599
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,715
You're not gonna
believe this.

600
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:52,559
GIoria Stanfield
is in the hospital.
She's been raped.

601
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,165
DOCTOR: Came in by ambulance
about an hour ago.

602
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,533
Contusions to her thighs
and upper arms.

603
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,265
Rape kit
was positive
for fluids.

604
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,863
She Iose
consciousness?

605
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,375
Awake for the whole thing.
He hit her hard.

606
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,274
Bruising's pretty severe.

607
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,506
No sign of trauma
to the baby.

608
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,606
We're keeping her overnight
for observation.

609
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,877
Thanks.

610
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,419
Who did this to you,
GIoria?

611
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,125
I don't know.

612
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,299
You gonna tell us
some stranger just crawled in
through your window?

613
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,936
Forget it, GIoria.

614
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,503
You know who did it
because you were
sleeping with him.

615
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,208
Every word
out of your mouth
has been a Iie.

616
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,183
Now, you want our help,
you give us his name

617
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,311
and you give it to us now.

618
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,457
Frank Barbarossa. I did...
I had a stupid fling with him.

619
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,589
I ended it months ago.

620
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:01,927
I thought he was over it,

621
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,902
and all this time
he was just thinking up
ways to hurt me.

622
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,131
He the father of your baby?

623
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,496
Mmm-hmm.

624
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,847
When he found out
that I married Kyle,
he went crazy.

625
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:24,915
I really did think that Kyle
killed his father. I was just
trying to protect him.

626
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,617
But now you think differently.
You think this

627
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,058
Frank murdered
your husband.

628
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,391
Yes.

629
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,089
He said it was my fault.

630
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,499
That if I keep
playing games with people,

631
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,698
sooner or Iater
that I was going to
have to pay.

632
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,934
And that
if I couldn't understand that,

633
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,910
that he would
do the same thing to me
that he did to Lawrence.

634
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,754
Frank Barbarossa?

635
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:04,920
Who are you?

636
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,191
Police, Frankie.
You're under arrest.

637
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,289
What are you
arresting me for?

638
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,594
Raping GIoria Stanfield.

639
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,101
Rape? Wait a minute.
She was raped?

640
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,194
And beaten, tough guy.

641
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,171
That why you pump iron?
So you can mess up women?

642
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,401
No, no,
you guys are making a mistake,
you're making a mistake.

643
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,568
I didn't... I didn't rape her.
I didn't rape her.

644
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:23,637
Then I'm glad we got
your DNA so we can clear
your good name.

645
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,180
FIN: No record.
The guy's a personal trainer.

646
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,119
Three of his clients Iive in
GIoria Stanfield's building.

647
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,348
She one of them?
No.

648
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,855
But he was there
the night of the murder.

649
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,552
Doorman didn't mention it
because Barbarossa's
in the building all the time.

650
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,891
He checked in at 7:30,
out by 9:10.

651
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,457
To see who?

652
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,794
According to this,
one of his clients,
Greta Zabor.

653
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,993
But she says
the training session
ended in an hour.

654
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,969
Which Ieaves half an hour
unaccounted for.

655
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,332
What happened to GIoria?

656
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,572
Ah, one of those guys
who Iikes to relive it.

657
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,080
Yeah. AII right.

658
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,446
Legs, arms.

659
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,541
Didn't touch
the face, though,

660
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:04,418
because what fun is it
to rape a movie star if you
can't recognize her, right?

661
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,788
Oh, my God.
What's the matter, Frankie?

662
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,886
You can't stand
the sight of
your own work?

663
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,328
No, I didn't do this.

664
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,366
I Iove her, okay?
I would never Iay
a hand on her.

665
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,559
Where were you
Iast night?

666
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,862
FRANK: I was home.

667
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,028
Anyone confirm that?

668
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,866
No, no. I Iive alone.

669
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,806
Look, why do you guys think
this was me?

670
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,570
Because she fingered you.
FRANK: What?

671
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,667
MUNCH: She said that
you raped her

672
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,371
then threatened to kill her
Iike you killed her husband.

673
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,470
No, that's a Iie.

674
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,447
Read her statement, Frank.
We got you.

675
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,575
FIN: And we got your DNA
to match to the rape kit.

676
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:38,384
That alone will get you
12-and-a-half to 25 years of
personal training at Attica.

677
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,892
No, man. It ain't gonna match,
because I didn't rape her.

678
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,259
Of course
there's a murder conviction.
That's another 25-to-Iife.

679
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,231
Your parole officer
hasn't even been born yet.

680
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,233
Look, I'm telling you guys,
I didn't kill anybody.

681
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,598
Think about this,
Frankie.

682
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,433
The jury sees you,
the schmuck trainer
to the rich and famous.

683
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,939
You're jealous,
you want what they have.

684
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,772
So you knock up the actress,
kill the husband
and set up the son.

685
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,709
We got officers going through
your place right now.

686
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:02,871
You think they're gonna
find anything?

687
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,244
Did you throw away
those shoes
you were wearing

688
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,680
when you killed
that guy?

689
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,617
I hope so, because
blood is really
hard to rub off.

690
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,517
FIN: Damn near impossible.

691
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,650
That Iying bitch.

692
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,125
Tell me about it.

693
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,498
That bitch!
I'm gonna kill her!
Sit down!

694
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:26,299
No. No, you get me a Iawyer.
You get me a Iawyer.
I don't say anything.

695
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,098
Legal Aid's backed up.

696
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,074
Frankie won't have
representation
until tonight.

697
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:35,340
It doesn't matter. Once the
DNA comes back, no Iawyer's
gonna get him out of this.

698
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,644
Got the LUDs
on Barbarossa's cell.
Something interesting.

699
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,379
He got a call the night
of Fuller's murder at 8:40.

700
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,513
There's a missing half hour.
He's still someplace
inside that building.

701
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,217
Where was the call from?

702
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,521
BENSON: Pay phone
in the deli across the street.

703
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,085
Odds are it's one
of two people,
GIoria or Kyle.

704
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,653
They were both out of
the apartment by then.

705
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,894
I doubt Kyle's gonna call
his wife's boyfriend.
It was her.

706
00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:00,631
She calls Barbarossa
minutes before
he kills her husband.

707
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,763
Why?

708
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,105
Find out.

709
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,173
FIN: You know this woman?

710
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,078
Yeah, yeah. Seen her
in the neighborhood.

711
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,548
Real diva, that one.

712
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,482
She ever been in here?

713
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,985
A few nights ago.

714
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,818
I asked her for
an autograph, she acted
Iike I was stalking her.

715
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,654
Screw her.
She's not that good
of an actress anyway.

716
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,092
What'd she come
in here for?

717
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,756
Made a phone call
on the payphone,

718
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,924
then she watched out
the window
for a few minutes,

719
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,524
made one more call,
then Ieft.

720
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,863
What was going on
out the window?

721
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,426
I think she was waiting
for somebody

722
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,199
to come out of the building
across the street.

723
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,138
You happen to eavesdrop
on those phone conversations?

724
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,005
No, man.
And I tried.

725
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,440
Thanks.

726
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,506
We got your message.

727
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,742
There's something wrong
with our DNA sample?

728
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,182
What did you do
to my sperm?

729
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,650
BENSON: Not a thing.

730
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,383
Somebody did, because
there's no way it came off
a rape victim. Look at this.

731
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,056
See how the tail
of each sperm is
bent at the tip?

732
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,595
Yeah. What does
that tell you?

733
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,187
This sperm was frozen.

734
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,993
So, unless your guy
was shooting
through ice cubes,

735
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,159
there's no way this semen
could have come from a rape.

736
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,327
Do we know
whose sperm it is?

737
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,495
Oh, it's your guy.

738
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,404
Frozen or not, the DNA
from the rape kit matched
the DNA from his towel

739
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,965
which matched
the paternity test.

740
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,806
There's another thing.

741
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:17,109
The presence of spermicide
from the rape kit sample.

742
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,808
Like from a condom.

743
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:22,614
That GIoria saved
after she had sex
with Frank Barbarossa.

744
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:26,646
She freezes it,
she plants it on herself
to set him up for rape.

745
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,824
And murder.

746
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,288
You drop the rape charges,

747
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,559
he'II plead to murder two,
minimum sentencing
recommendation.

748
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,792
Why should we do that?

749
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,836
Because he's gonna give you
GIoria Stanfield.

750
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,837
He agrees to testify
against her, assuming
we can corroborate his story,

751
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,842
and you've got a deal.

752
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,576
Go ahead.

753
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,043
The bitch set me up.

754
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:54,414
Frankie, just tell her
what you know, okay?

755
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,620
I'd have done
anything for her.

756
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,627
I didn't care about
the money and all that.

757
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,094
I killed the husband,
but I did it because
GIoria told me to.

758
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,432
CABOT: How did she
set up the murder?

759
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,174
She called me that night,
and she said he was crazy,

760
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:20,938
and that if I didn't do it
right then, that he was
going to kill her.

761
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,309
Did she pay you?

762
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,575
That's not why I did it.

763
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,879
She said she was afraid
for her Iife.

764
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,784
He used to knock her
and those kids around
all the time.

765
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,516
If he was out of the way,
that we could be together,

766
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,716
but he'd never Iet her go.

767
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:38,251
Telling you about her
abusive husband doesn't mean
she asked you to kill him.

768
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,160
Well, how the hell you think
I got in the apartment?

769
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,459
She gave me
the security code.

770
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,863
That doesn't
prove anything.

771
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:43,958
Why the hell not?

772
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,297
Because you were
screwing her,

773
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,961
so she could have
given it to you
at any time.

774
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,699
Yeah, but she made up
a rape to frame me.

775
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,765
That proves that
she's a Iiar,
not a murderer.

776
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:52,866
The kid's baseball bat.

777
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:56,038
She told me where it was
and she told me what to do
with it when I was done.

778
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,172
It was her idea
to set him up, too.

779
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,774
Mr. Barbarossa,
with your statement
you are the only person

780
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,409
going to jail for this murder.

781
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,716
I need something
I can prove.

782
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,232
Well, I guess she's gonna
get away with it.

783
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,339
We arresting her?

784
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,535
Nothing he said definitively
points to GIoria.

785
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,670
This might.
Dumped the payphone
from the deli.

786
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,476
That other call
that GIoria made
went to Kyle Fuller's cell.

787
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,278
Wonder what that
conversation entailed.

788
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,081
"Honey, get out of the house.
Your father's about
to get murdered."

789
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,587
Would explain
why he's sitting in Rikers.

790
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,419
He thinks she did it,
he's protecting her.

791
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:41,924
You get Kyle
to testify to that,

792
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,156
we've got corroboration
and an indictment
against GIoria.

793
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,753
When's Kyle
getting released?

794
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,459
I'm bringing Barbarossa's
confession before a judge
tomorrow morning

795
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,467
to formally drop the charges.

796
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,059
Kyle's a free man by noon.

797
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,468
And a dead man.

798
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:55,698
He cashes in that trust,

799
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,038
GIoria's got no reason
to keep him around anymore.

800
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,304
My client's being released
within the hour, Detective,

801
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,849
so I'm not quite sure
what we're doing here.

802
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,543
You know why
they're dropping
the charges?

803
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,676
Because I didn't
kill my father.

804
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:09,913
They tell you
who did?

805
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,547
Some guy that worked
in my apartment building.

806
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,250
No, not some guy.

807
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,253
Your stepmother's
boyfriend.

808
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,555
You think you can just
make up these Iies
and I'm gonna believe you?

809
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,293
You've been
sitting in prison
for one reason,

810
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,029
your stepmother
set you up for murder.

811
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,070
That's not true.

812
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,300
Kyle, think about it.

813
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,236
The weapon was
your baseball bat,
hidden under your bed.

814
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,304
And whose idea
was that?

815
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,179
It was your
stepmother's.

816
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,877
GIoria is my wife.

817
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,317
Who's having
another guy's baby.

818
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,995
STABLER: Results of
her paternity test.
See for yourself.

819
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,304
Kyle, there's no reason
to protect her anymore.

820
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,344
She doesn't deserve it.

821
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,875
It's not true.

822
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,086
Can't argue with DNA.

823
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:31,234
BENSON: She had
her boyfriend
kill your father.

824
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:38,064
And he did it because GIoria
told him that they would
Iive happily ever after.

825
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,577
She said the same thing
to you, didn't she?

826
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:47,780
But you couldn't kill him,
and so she got someone else
to do it.

827
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,481
But she wanted
to get married to me.

828
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,682
It was her idea.

829
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,056
So you wouldn't testify
against her.

830
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,887
But I would have
protected her.
She didn't have to Iie.

831
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,600
She called you that night
before you Ieft the apartment.

832
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,568
What'd she say to you?

833
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,604
She told me to Ieave.

834
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:17,246
That she was gonna take care
of everything, and that after
that night we'd be together.

835
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,912
She told me she Ioved me.

836
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,464
Hey, can I have
your autograph?

837
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,830
What, are you
following me?

838
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,235
We heard you made
an appointment.

839
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,831
Family planning services.
You're getting rid
of the baby, too.

840
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,810
Guess nobody's safe
around you.

841
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,185
Hey.

842
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,961
What are you doing?

843
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,295
Sweetheart, I told you
why I can't have the baby.

844
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,857
We agreed that this was
the best thing for us.

845
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,096
Right.

846
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,300
KYLE: But you said
it was mine.

847
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,569
Which proves
we were having sex
before I was 17.

848
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,611
Kyle, this is for us.

849
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,113
No, it's not.

850
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,876
Look, I know
the baby isn't mine.

851
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:32,412
So if you wanna kill it,
go ahead.
I don't care anymore.

852
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,650
Kyle, please.

853
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,157
Just tell me something.

854
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:40,186
This whole time
we were together,
this whole year,

855
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,799
was it all
part of your plan?

856
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,360
Make me Iove you
so I would do
whatever you wanted?

857
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,700
Absolutely not.

858
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,469
Because if it was,
you didn't have to do that.

859
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,912
You didn't have to pretend.

860
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,108
I already Ioved you, GIoria.

861
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,251
I can't remember
when I didn't.

862
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,418
I do Iove you, Kyle.

863
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,648
We're married.

864
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,922
That's why I don't wanna have
another man's baby.

865
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,659
Look, I only Iied to you

866
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,567
because I thought you were
too young to understand.
It was my mistake.

867
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,071
I will not Iet that
happen again.

868
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,273
I had my Iawyer do this.

869
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,011
It's for you.
BENSON: Petition
for divorce, GIoria.

870
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,313
You're gonna be
a free woman.

871
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,754
Not for Iong, though.
You're under arrest
for murder.

872
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,214
You don't know
what you're doing, Kyle.

873
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,351
No.

874
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,295
I know exactly
what I'm doing,

875
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,692
Mom.
