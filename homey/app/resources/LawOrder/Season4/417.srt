1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,064
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:06,799
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,033
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,009
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,604
are members of
an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,649
These are their stories.

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,481
Love is all
very nice, darling,
but what does he really want?

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:29,018
Your pecan pies
or your nice,
fat bank balance?

9
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,261
What on earth?

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,300
Not you, dear.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,638
I think there's a dead
animal in my wisteria.

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:46,009
Now, if AIbert
is only after sex,

13
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,238
you have my blessing.

14
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,216
I mean, you're pushing 70.

15
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,214
How many more rides are Ieft
on the merry-go-round?

16
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,317
(SCREAMING)

17
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,832
Home owner's name
is Katerina BIundell.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,663
Victim dropped in
on her unexpectedly.

19
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,227
She's in her 20s.
Wearing a maid's uniform.
No ID.

20
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,034
Miss BIundell
have a housekeeper?

21
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,699
No. Lives alone.

22
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,675
She recognize the victim
from the neighborhood?

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,269
I doubt it.
The victim has no face.

24
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,405
From the Iividity,
she's been dead a while.

25
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,744
Why'd you call us?

26
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,342
WARNER: Looks Iike a suicide,
but somebody worked
her over pretty good.

27
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,887
There's bruising
on her breasts,
buttocks, thighs.

28
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,149
Maybe a rape
and toss?

29
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,383
Some of these
are old.

30
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,255
This stuff didn't
just happen once.

31
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,554
BENSON: Looks Iike
she fell from there.

32
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,652
STABLER: Trellacker Tower.
Millionaire heaven.

33
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,357
So she Iands head first,
breaks the glass,

34
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,366
falls onto the plants
which hold her for a while

35
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,130
until Katerina
goes poking around.

36
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,195
She's a maid.
Probably doesn't
speak much English.

37
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,331
AIone in a foreign country.
If she was raped,

38
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,501
it's not surprising
she didn't call the cops.

39
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,011
So she takes the high dive.

40
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,740
Or she was pushed.

41
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,294
STABLER: Mr. Paysen?
Yeah.

42
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,667
SVU. Detective Stabler.
My partner, Detective Benson.

43
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,571
Now, the doorman says
that you run security
for the Lamerly family.

44
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,233
Yeah. SVU?
What's this about?

45
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,642
We've got a jumper.
Looks Iike she fell
from the penthouse.

46
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,940
Did you check all
the other apartments?

47
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,211
Well, the doorman says that
the windows don't open wide
enough to Iet a child out.

48
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,149
Well, why is sex crimes
interested in a suicide?

49
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,517
We believe that
she was assaulted
before she fell.

50
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,055
You did some
time on the job?

51
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,591
Put in my 20 at the 29.
When'd this happen?

52
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,149
Sometime over
the weekend.

53
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,195
No one's been in
the penthouse from
Friday morning

54
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,854
till Sunday night when
Mrs. Lamerly came home.

55
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,955
From where?
Connecticut.

56
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,624
The rest of the family's
still up there.

57
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,498
I drove Mrs. L. back early
to take in a concert.

58
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,538
There's no sign
of a break-in.

59
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,233
Even so, we'd Iike
to take a Iook around.

60
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,243
Like I said, nobody's been
here since Friday morning.

61
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,974
Well, we could come back
with a warrant and a couple
of TV crews if you'd Iike.

62
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,183
Just Iet me
warn the old Iady.

63
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,180
Thank you.

64
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,425
You think she fell
from our balcony?

65
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,982
BENSON: It seems Iikely.

66
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,529
Oh, the poor soul.
Do you know who she is?

67
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,727
We're working on that.
She was wearing
a housekeeper's uniform.

68
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,098
Gray dress,
white apron.

69
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,967
But all our help
had the weekend off.

70
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,370
STABLER: We'II need
names and addresses.

71
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,636
Of course.
Tom will get
them for you.

72
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,182
BENSON: There's our
crime scene.

73
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,310
There's no sign of
a struggle here or inside.

74
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,411
I still don't
understand how she
could've got out here.

75
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,286
We're going to need to take
a Iook at the building
security camera tapes.

76
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,552
Ma'am, please don't
touch the railing.

77
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,356
I'm sorry. Is this
where she fell?

78
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,452
Looks Iike it.

79
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,054
We're going to have to have
a Crime Scene Unit come up
here and check things out.

80
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,463
Of course.

81
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,070
Lamerly money comes
from Iate Grandpa's
real estate business.

82
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,765
He had the cash,
Grandma had the class.

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,467
Son Douglas runs
everything now.

84
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,532
Wife Iives in Bermuda
and rarely comes ashore.

85
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,599
Kids?

86
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,044
Yeah, one son, Drew,
just back from Europe.

87
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,308
And what about Granny?

88
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,874
She hosts tea parties
and presides over
a dozen charitable events.

89
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,544
Their story hold up?

90
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,248
Doorman said that
the penthouse had
no visitors over the weekend,

91
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,723
but he can't see who comes
in through the garage.

92
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,056
FIN: This is off
the penthouse Iobby camera.

93
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,096
4:45 p.m. Saturday.

94
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,892
She's got her own key.
Any pictures of her face?

95
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,095
Now, that would be too easy.
And that's it.

96
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,762
She's the only one who
went into the penthouse

97
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,170
till Gran and the chauffeur
come home Sunday evening.

98
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,936
Any reports of
missing servants?

99
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,239
AII present and
accounted for.

100
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,609
So who is this woman?

101
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,080
I'm running prints,
dental, DNA.

102
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,146
There's too much bone damage
to try facial reconstruction.

103
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,123
Tested her for
drugs and alcohol.
She's clean.

104
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,454
Did you get anything
from the rape kit?

105
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,687
No fluids.

106
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,288
But traces of
Iubricant and spermicide.
Her attacker used a condom.

107
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,595
Can you connect the assault
to the time of death?

108
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,899
Most of the bruises
and strap marks are old,
but there are petechiae here.

109
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,439
Broken capillaries
that didn't have
time to form bruises.

110
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,975
So she was raped, beaten,
and went up to
the penthouse to die?

111
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,807
Or she Iikes rough sex.
None of this proves
she was raped.

112
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,109
Hands around
the throat could be
erotic asphyxiation.

113
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,151
The strap marks could be
the badge of an S&M junkie.

114
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,914
Possible. The degree
of violence is pretty
controlled.

115
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,615
Another thing,
CSU only found one shoe.

116
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,282
They're still Iooking
for the second one.

117
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,953
Pretty high-end for a maid.

118
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,156
Nice stockings, too.

119
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,668
Okay, she's wearing
high heels, fancy underwear,
dresses Iike a maid,

120
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,296
and Iets herself into
a rich man's apartment?

121
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,704
Sounds Iike an out-call
fantasy to me.

122
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,139
My God.

123
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,640
I think it's Anna.

124
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,080
I can't believe
she'd do this.

125
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,140
Who's Anna,
Mr. Lamerly?

126
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,710
Anna Rivera.

127
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,448
She worked
a month for us,

128
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,286
and then we Iearned
that she Iied about
her Iegal status.

129
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,916
Last week we
had to Iet her go.

130
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,427
Do you always check
the immigration
status of your staff?

131
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,929
We Iead public Iives,
Detective.

132
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,624
We have to be able
to withstand scrutiny.

133
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,894
Do you have any idea
why Anna would kill herself?

134
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,464
She was very upset
about Iosing the job.

135
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,699
She begged us
not to fire her.

136
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,265
But I honestly never
thought she'd do this.

137
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,312
The severance
was very generous.
Three months' salary.

138
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,677
That'II put a dent
in the bank account.

139
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,876
Did Anna usually wear
shoes Iike this to work?

140
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,475
I have no idea.

141
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,384
I don't inspect
the staff's shoes.

142
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,618
She was wearing
stiletto heels
and expensive underwear.

143
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,091
I don't think she came up
to polish the credenza.

144
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,458
What are you trying
to say, Detective?

145
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,589
Whoever abused Anna
made a habit of it.

146
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,392
Her body showed signs
of repeated, violent sex.

147
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,992
Well, what has that
got to do with me?

148
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,334
Anna came to this
apartment to die,
Mr. Lamerly.

149
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,668
Why do you think
she did that?

150
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,141
You can't honestly
think I have anything
to do with this.

151
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,939
How well did
your son know her?

152
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,673
Where was he
Saturday night?

153
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,375
In Connecticut.
We all were.

154
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,114
You barge in here,
no warrant, no nothing,
making wild accusations...

155
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,383
Douglas, please.
Don't shout.

156
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,725
Police have to
do their job.

157
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,318
BENSON: Do you know
where Anna used to Iive?

158
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,728
My son will get
you the address.

159
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,993
LAYTON: Detectives?

160
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,825
Something you should see.

161
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,429
BENSON: Prints.

162
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,871
Took the same prints
on the balcony door.

163
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,875
Was she alone?
Far as I can tell.

164
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,808
There's only the one set.
What about inside?

165
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,177
Nothing. PIace is immaculate.
But, hey, Granny Iooks
Iike a clean freak.

166
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,615
So our victim gets attacked
someplace else but comes here
to kill herself?

167
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,677
She came straight out here,
she climbs over the edge,

168
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,016
she holds onto the railing.

169
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,080
Smearing suggests
she didn't Iet go
right away.

170
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,251
She changed her mind.
She tried to pull herself up.

171
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,521
STABLER: Wasn't strong enough.

172
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,857
Anna's address.

173
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,600
BENSON: Mr. Karenn,
when was the Iast
time you saw Anna?

174
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,967
When she paid her rent.
Tuesday.

175
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,630
Did she pay you
for the whole month?

176
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,800
Wouldn't be
Iiving here
otherwise.

177
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,338
She ever bring
boyfriends here?

178
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,379
No. Is she in trouble?

179
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,573
That's what we're
trying to find out.

180
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,207
This her?

181
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,877
Yeah.

182
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,045
You got any
numbers or addresses
for her family?

183
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,022
Said she was from
Guatemala. Try there.

184
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,456
Can't find a note.

185
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,451
What was Anna Iike,
Mr. Karenn?

186
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,363
Quiet, clean.
She paid her rent.
Perfect.

187
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,168
Then I guess
you'd be real upset
to find out she's dead.

188
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,534
Oh, jeez.

189
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,997
What am I going to
do with her stuff?

190
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,008
Why don't you
send it to Guatemala?

191
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,307
We'II take these for the M.E.
so she can make a positive ID.

192
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,440
Can't get anything
off of these for DNA.
They're brand new.

193
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,883
Oh, well, that figures.
AII right, I'II have CSU
comb the place.

194
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,318
Take a Iook
at this first.

195
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,584
Lots of fine cuts,
some healed, some new.

196
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,957
BENSON: From cleaning
a penthouse?

197
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,086
I swabbed her hands.

198
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,357
Didn't find any
household cleaners
that a maid would use.

199
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,661
Only an acetone
called Rexton,

200
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,293
exclusively used
in cleaning
motion picture film.

201
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,066
Early 20s,
handles Iots of film.

202
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,606
Could be a
film student.

203
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,274
The Lamerlys were
definitely in Connecticut.

204
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,607
Had some Iocal muckety-mucks
over for dinner.

205
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,978
Son Drew even got his picture
taken up there running a red
Iight in his Iittle Audi.

206
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,516
6:10 p.m.

207
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,983
Anything on
the film schools?

208
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,417
Thanks.

209
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,886
Any idea how many
film schools there
are in New York?

210
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,356
PIus a student failing
to show up for class
on Monday morning

211
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,689
is not exactly going
to set off alarms.

212
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,421
Any chance Anna
was taking classes?

213
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,430
Well, not unless she
went by the name of
Carmen Trancoso.

214
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,797
Carmen was supposed
to screen her first-year
film at the New School.

215
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,429
She didn't show. The girl she
made it with said she hasn't
seen her since Saturday.

216
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,835
Suzie, you knew her
well. Has Carmen been
upset Iately?

217
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,972
Why? Tell me
what's going on.

218
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,310
We're worried
about her.

219
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,112
Does she Ieave her
personal stuff here?

220
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,846
This is hers.

221
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,419
And this stuff.

222
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,148
Yeah? Where's Carmen from?

223
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,194
Sao Paulo, Brazil.

224
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,661
Well, she have a hard
time adjusting here?

225
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,634
She does okay
considering her
English isn't too good.

226
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,260
Is this Carmen?

227
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,702
She's a beautiful girl.

228
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,866
Does she have
a boyfriend?

229
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,844
Used to. They broke up.
Carmen was pretty upset.

230
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,277
BENSON: She talk
to you about it?

231
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,405
Not really.

232
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,382
Well, what'd
she say about it?

233
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,315
That she was going
to make him pay.

234
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,852
Well, do you think Carmen
was upset enough to try
to hurt herself?

235
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,688
What do you mean?
Is that what's happened?

236
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,059
We don't know,
but we have to Iook at
all the possibilities.

237
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,995
What's her
boyfriend's name?

238
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,862
Drew. Drew Lamerly.

239
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,464
M.E. confirms.

240
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,199
The DNA off
the Iipstick proves
that the dead girl

241
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,798
is Drew Lamerly's ex,
Carmen Trancoso.

242
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,277
So he dumps her, she goes
to his apartment for an
attention-seeking suicide?

243
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,041
Dresses as the maid
to get by the doorman.

244
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,844
She uses a key that
either Drew gave her
or she stole it.

245
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,044
What about Anna Rivera?
Vanished.

246
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,553
Customs has no record
of her on any flights
out of New York.

247
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,591
And if she's going to go home,
why not take all of her stuff
with her?

248
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,853
Look who's here.
Poster boy.

249
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,152
Hi. Can we help you?

250
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,896
My name is Drew Lamerly.

251
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,327
Suzie called me.

252
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,891
I think I should
make a statement.

253
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,204
About what?

254
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,534
Carmen Trancoso.

255
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,468
It's my fault
she's dead.

256
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,875
Carmen and I went
out for about a month.

257
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,179
It was intense.

258
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,221
So intense it scared me.
I broke up with her.

259
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,620
When'd you break up?

260
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,284
About ten days ago.
She took it bad.

261
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,259
She kept coming
to the apartment,
following me around.

262
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,023
When was the Iast time
you talked to her, Drew?

263
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,759
Saturday. She called me,
begged me to see her.

264
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,825
I said I was with
my family in the country.
She became hysterical.

265
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,234
Said she'd make me sorry
if I didn't come over.

266
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,364
So I told her to get
a Iife and I hung up.

267
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,705
If I'd just gone there,
been kind to her,
she might still be alive.

268
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,945
What time did
she call you?

269
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,578
Around 5:30, I think.

270
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,550
So Anna Rivera
isn't dead then.

271
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,484
No, she's not.

272
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,523
One of the other
maids just heard from her.
Turns out she's in Miami.

273
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,889
Why'd she run and Ieave
everything behind?

274
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,488
Well, she didn't.
Her aunt was really sick
and she had to go see her.

275
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,055
Aunt is sick.

276
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,358
I'm missing something here.

277
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,735
Drew, why did your dad say
the dead girl was Anna?

278
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,673
He got all teary-eyed
and everything.

279
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,709
Well, the girl in the tape
Iooks just Iike Anna.

280
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,142
She's wearing
a maid's uniform.

281
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,906
Well, so was Carmen.

282
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,015
Why is that?

283
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,484
She knew she couldn't
get into the building
any other way.

284
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,487
I'd told the doorman
not to Iet her in.

285
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,053
Carmen got by him dressed
as a maid. She get a copy
of your key?

286
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,323
Yes, which she must have
taken from me while I was
sleeping and duped it.

287
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,387
You guys spent
the night together
a Iot, right?

288
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,229
Well, I told you,
it was a very
intense relationship.

289
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,534
You call beating
the crap out of
her intense, huh?

290
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,073
You Iittle prick,
you did this to her.

291
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,575
Yes, I did do this,
but she wanted me to.

292
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,339
No. No woman wants this.

293
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,505
Carmen did!
This was her thing.

294
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,776
So you beat and rape her
because it was her thing?

295
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,182
I never raped her.
She Iiked it.

296
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,982
It was never enough, though.
She wanted more.

297
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,920
She wanted more of what?

298
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,458
She... She wanted me to...

299
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,517
She wanted me to choke her
until she blacked out.

300
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,426
But I couldn't do that.
I couldn't.

301
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,260
That's when I knew
it was too much.

302
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,766
I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry, okay?

303
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,492
(SIGHS)

304
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,901
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,131
Drew's story checked out.

306
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,733
We got a 10-minute call
from the penthouse
to Connecticut.

307
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,334
5:32 p.m. Saturday.

308
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,470
What about the bruising?

309
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,845
M.E. said the violence
was controlled. So it
could have been consensual.

310
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,383
What's your take
on this kid?

311
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,385
He's got answers
for everything.

312
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,388
Fin, you and Munch see
if Drew's got history.
But do it quietly.

313
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,323
I don't want the Lamerlys
complaining to the brass
that we're harassing them.

314
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,122
You know,
this is Carmen's
date book.

315
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,221
She met with
this Roger Burnbaum
three times Iast week.

316
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,526
There's a number here.

317
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,965
Another boyfriend?

318
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,728
Maybe it was Drew
who didn't end it.

319
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,294
Maybe Carmen dumped him
for this Roger Burnbaum.

320
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,737
Guess who I'm holding for.

321
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,368
Roger Burnbaum and DeLisle,
personal injury Iawyers.

322
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,775
She was suing someone.

323
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:45,140
We represent Carmen Trancoso,
but I can't say why
without her permission.

324
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,048
She can't give it.
She's dead.

325
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,518
What happened?

326
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,918
She committed suicide.

327
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,581
So I hope
you're paid up.

328
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,852
We take cases on
a contingency basis.

329
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,359
No win, no fee.

330
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,486
That's noble of you.
What was Carmen
hoping to win?

331
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,260
A substantial settlement
from her ex-boyfriend
for rape.

332
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,701
Her ex-boyfriend
being Drew Lamerly.

333
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,532
How do you know?
She said she
hadn't told anybody.

334
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,367
Carmen died by
throwing herself 20 floors
from the Lamerly penthouse.

335
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,139
STABLER: She have
a good case against him?

336
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,113
To be honest, no.

337
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:20,344
She told me her sex Iife
with Mr. Lamerly had gotten
increasingly violent.

338
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,319
She tried to break up,
he pursued her.

339
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,356
When she resisted,
he raped and beat her.

340
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,118
And how is that
not a good case?

341
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,352
She refused to report
the rape to the police.

342
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,725
Afraid it might
affect her student visa.

343
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,854
BENSON: Did you believe her?

344
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,956
I believe
he hurt her very badly,

345
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,001
but I wasn't
sure he raped her.

346
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,467
But you took the case anyway.

347
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,027
Yes. I thought they'd settle.

348
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,268
If you were the Lamerlys,
would you want this
sort of publicity?

349
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,537
LAMERLY: Detectives,
our attorney, Lorna Scarry.

350
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,845
Funny, we just came from
Carmen Trancoso's attorney.

351
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,317
How is Mr. DeLisle?
Hit by any ambulances Iately?

352
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,650
He's sad that he won't
be trying his case.

353
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,314
Oh, pity.

354
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,553
Just when he thought
the gravy train had
stopped at his station.

355
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,686
You see a raped woman
as a gravy train?

356
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,320
I swear to you
I never raped her.

357
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,523
Drew.

358
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,294
Believe me, officers,
I am sorry for the girl's
death,

359
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,063
but she was unbalanced.

360
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,195
She tried emotional blackmail,
she tried the Iaw,

361
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:17,572
and when she realized that
we weren't going to cave in to
her outrageous claims,

362
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,769
she killed herself.

363
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,678
Well, the marks on
Carmen's body support
those outrageous claims.

364
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,306
I told you,
that's what she wanted.

365
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,614
Well, that's easy to say,
given she's not here
to defend herself.

366
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,983
Can you prove it?

367
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,454
It's not our job to prove.
But we can.

368
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,826
Affidavits from
three of Carmen's
former boyfriends,

369
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,758
two of whom
she picked up in bars.

370
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,854
They testified that
she was an animal.

371
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,058
The rougher the sex,
the better.

372
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:46,194
So our victim is now a
gold-digging whore and we are
totally being jerked around.

373
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,000
Every time we come
up with something,

374
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,167
the Lamerlys are ready
and waiting with some
plausible explanation.

375
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,232
What've you got?

376
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,903
Facts and figures
on Drew Lamerly.

377
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:57,312
Your typical red-blooded,
all-American boy with an
eight-figure trust fund.

378
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:01,581
Wrapped a few sports cars
around Iampposts,
a few parking tickets,

379
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,780
but no record,
no ex-girlfriends
crying rape.

380
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,585
He's popular.
PIayed hockey and tennis.

381
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,124
Good enough for any
college varsity team.

382
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,093
Except he didn't graduate
high school. He spent three
years at college in Paris.

383
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,630
Well, you know what I think?
I think we've got nothing
we can prove

384
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,998
and too many cases with real,
Iive victims to waste time
chasing shadows.

385
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,165
Now, see if there's a reason
Drew didn't graduate.
If there isn't, case closed.

386
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,471
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

387
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,503
I'm afraid the Radleigh School
didn't quite meet
Drew Lamerly's needs.

388
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,775
Can you translate
that for me?

389
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,283
We expelled him. Pity.
He was a good student.

390
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,512
What did he do?

391
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,247
Disrupted our senior prom.

392
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,757
He brought a very attractive
older woman as his date.

393
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,124
I suspect it was to show off,
but she seemed out of her
element.

394
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,662
Kind of girl you
don't bring home
to Mom and Dad.

395
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,788
Precisely.

396
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,094
Well, it still doesn't
explain why you kicked
him out.

397
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:53,697
To cut a sordid story short,
they both got drunk,
there was an altercation.

398
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,866
The woman called the police
and accused Drew
of assaulting her.

399
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,739
Did he?

400
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,712
The police didn't
seem to think so.

401
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,476
And neither,
in the cold Iight of day,
did the young woman.

402
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,643
She dropped the charges.

403
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,245
However, school policy
is very clear on
these matters.

404
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,620
No alcohol.
He had to go.

405
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,318
Do you remember
the young woman's name?

406
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,952
It was five years ago.

407
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,621
Radleigh High prom
gives us a date,
May 16th, '97.

408
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,930
We're at the 29 now. Yeah.

409
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,163
AII right,
we'II be in touch,
Captain.

410
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,730
Anything?

411
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,966
There's no 61.

412
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,933
You mean no one
filed a complaint?

413
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,274
Oh, they filed a complaint,
but the 61's disappeared.

414
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,871
Looks Iike the Lamerlys
are sweeping up after
Drew again.

415
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,474
This time they
missed some dirt.

416
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,145
One of the cops
filled out an "Aided" card.

417
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,348
They're not kept
in the same place
as the 61s.

418
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,483
Nope. Card gives the
assault victim's name
as a Miss Jenny White, 24.

419
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,687
She refused medical
assistance, but she
did give us an address.

420
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,100
I'm Camilla Hartnell.
Can I help you?

421
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,501
Yeah. Detective Benson,
this is Detective Stabler,
SVU.

422
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,563
We'd Iike to speak
to a Miss Jenny White.

423
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,133
Jenny gave this address
in a complaint that
she made to the police.

424
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,303
When?

425
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,473
About five years ago.
She was assaulted
at a high school prom.

426
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,880
It's taken you
this Iong to respond?

427
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,417
Well, we have some
new information.

428
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,114
I'm sorry, I... I've Iived
here for 20 years and I don't
know a Jenny White.

429
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,281
You know him?

430
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,415
No.

431
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,895
Oh, Frank, hi!
See you tonight
at around 6:00. Bye.

432
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,453
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

433
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,897
No. Thank you so much.

434
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,228
BENSON: It's a dead end.
Maybe.

435
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,098
I think we need
to talk to the cops
who took the statement.

436
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,364
STABLER: Wait, check this out.

437
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,735
Want to go get
a cup of coffee?
Come on, come on.

438
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,205
Yeah, okay.

439
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,873
I think one of
Mrs. Hartnell's girls just
decided not to come home.

440
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,208
PIace is a brothel.

441
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,504
(KNOCKING)

442
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,948
Oh, you're still here.

443
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,480
Yeah, and we're going to stay
here until you start telling
us the truth.

444
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,651
I have told
you the truth.

445
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,217
Then your memory's
not serving you correctly.

446
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,593
Jenny White works for you,

447
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,892
and if you don't
tell us where she is,

448
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,660
we're going to have
Vice tear this place apart.

449
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,360
Do you really think
I'm afraid of Vice?

450
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,834
AII I need to do is
make one phone call...

451
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,495
Great. Why don't you go
ahead and do that then?

452
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,164
Excuse me,
but where do you
think you're going?

453
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,401
AII right, Iisten up.
NYPD. This is a raid.

454
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,737
Everyone up
against this wall.

455
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,902
BENSON: Let's go.
You, all of you out of here.

456
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,002
Stand right there.
Come on.

457
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,947
PIease, don't do this. Don't.
I'II tell you, I'II tell you.

458
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,209
Jenny White stopped working
here three years ago.

459
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,583
BENSON: Where is she?

460
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,851
Married to Angus Rochester,
one of the richest men
in Manhattan.

461
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,451
And I think you'II find
she's similarly disinclined
to remember the past.

462
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,887
Excuse me,
Jennifer White?

463
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,566
I'm sorry,
my name's Rochester.

464
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,102
Prom night,
Radleigh High School.
Remember?

465
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,297
I don't know what
you're talking about.

466
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,571
Sure you do. We spoke
to your former employer,
Mrs. Hartnell.

467
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,202
Drew Lamerly ring a bell?

468
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,047
We believe he raped
another young woman
who recently killed herself.

469
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,743
ANGUS: Jen!

470
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,484
Lady, we don't care
who you were or who you are.

471
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,786
Just yes or no,
did Drew Lamerly
rape you?

472
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,359
Yes, he raped me.

473
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,760
But if you ask me anything
in front of my husband,
I will deny it.

474
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,095
Oh, who's that?

475
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,067
ANGUS: Hi, hon.
Hi, sweetie.

476
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,161
Stabler. Yeah.

477
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,005
So now Drew gets
away with it again.

478
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,669
Maybe Drew's
Iuck just ran out.

479
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,115
Something was bugging me
about Carmen's suicide,
the arc of the fall.

480
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,118
So I had the boys
set up a simulation.

481
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,051
Digital model of
Trellacker Tower.

482
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,590
The M.E. gave us
Carmen's weight,
factored in building height,

483
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,650
wind speed,
body's acceleration.

484
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:39,163
If Carmen just Iet go of
the railing or simply stepped
off it, this is what happens.

485
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,931
BENSON: She falls into
the yard next door.

486
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,633
Five yards short
of where she actually
Ianded.

487
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,235
But if she's given some
Iateral propulsion from
the railing, we get this.

488
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,545
Lateral propulsion.
She was pushed.

489
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,985
That's right.

490
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:08,015
Wait, but the prints show
that she was over the railing
clinging onto the edge.

491
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,357
Yeah, but if she's pushed
back against the railing,

492
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,489
she'd be gripping it
in exactly the same way.

493
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,795
So he pushes her
further and further,

494
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,802
she fights, she kicks him,
the shoe comes off,

495
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,170
but his body weight is
against her, she can't
hold anymore, she goes over.

496
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:26,005
Not suicide, murder.

497
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,183
So somebody pushed
Carmen off the roof.

498
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,480
For all the evidence
you've got, it might
as well be a ghost.

499
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,384
That ghost is
Drew Lamerly.

500
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,686
Wouldn't be the first rich kid
who thinks he's entitled
to treat women how he wants.

501
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,283
You only have
the two rape cases,
Jenny White and Carmen?

502
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,056
Well, one can't talk
and the other one won't.

503
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,687
We've been Iooking.
Can't find anyone else.

504
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,131
But who knows how many others
were bought off or intimidated
into silence?

505
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,463
Okay, what's your
next move?

506
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,833
Well, Fin's checking
on why the cops buried

507
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,929
Jenny White's 61
from five years ago.

508
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,203
CSU just found the other shoe
stuck in a tree
nearly half a block away.

509
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,107
They're running tests.

510
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,043
It's Drew, Captain,
and I'm going to put
him on that balcony.

511
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,309
Well, your first
problem is

512
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:09,252
to explain how he is running
a red Iight in Connecticut
at the time of Carmen's death.

513
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,688
What if he's not Drew?
Baseball cap is
covering half his face.

514
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,818
Well, it doesn't help us
if it's not a positive ID.

515
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,590
Isn't there some work
you could be doing, John?

516
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,823
I am working.

517
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,265
The techs checked the security
tape after Carmen entered
the penthouse.

518
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,360
Came up with zip.
I've been Iooking at
it before she arrived.

519
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,563
I think I got something.

520
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,538
Look at the second
hand on the clock.

521
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,837
It stops and then
it jumps forward.

522
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,638
BENSON: Ten seconds
are missing.

523
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,442
Somebody cut it
out of that tape.

524
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,845
The doorman said
that a repairman
from tower security

525
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,509
came by Sunday morning
to do a maintenance check.

526
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,643
So at 4:15,
half an hour
before Carmen arrived,

527
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,153
we've got someone
entering that penthouse.

528
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,449
He was waiting for her.

529
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:49,253
That call from the penthouse
to Connecticut at 5:30 wasn't
from Carmen,

530
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,955
it was from Drew,
calling home
to say what happened.

531
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,830
Dad jumps into Drew's car,
runs a red Iight,
it's an instant alibi.

532
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,393
So Drew kills Carmen
but Ieaves no trace of
himself on her or the balcony

533
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,804
and he's clever enough to make
sure that Carmen's prints
are Ieft on the railing?

534
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,307
This kid had to have help.

535
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,608
He did.
Guess which cop interviewed
Jenny White five years ago?

536
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,274
Tom Paysen,
the Lamerlys' Mr. Fix-it.

537
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,712
PIot's starting to unravel,
Tom. We know about Jenny,
the camera...

538
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,812
I don't follow you.

539
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,722
Drew calls Carmen,
tells her to come
over to his penthouse.

540
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,157
"Let's try to
work things out."

541
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,991
Then he tells her to dress
as a maid so the doorman
doesn't recognize her.

542
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,555
Yeah, and Carmen comes over,
she still Ioves Drew,
but they fight.

543
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,965
So he rapes her
and pushes her
off the balcony.

544
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,731
That's when
the cover-ups begin.

545
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,472
Word from the Iocal precinct
is the jumper has no face.

546
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,877
Cover up number one,
girl's in a maid's uniform,
why not call her Anna Rivera?

547
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:45,576
FIN: Anna gets moved out,
place gets cleaned so the DNA
doesn't mess up the story.

548
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,413
But the dumb old cops
figure out
it's Carmen anyway.

549
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,976
Cover up number two,

550
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:53,252
Carmen's a nut and a whore
who offs herself because
she Ioses her rich boyfriend.

551
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,656
But who could have
fixed all this?

552
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,321
Somebody who knows
how the police think,
how they work.

553
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,089
You.

554
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,831
I got to hand it
to you guys. SVU.

555
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,840
I thought you were
just the panty police,
but you're right up there.

556
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,000
Up where?

557
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:15,172
Dreamland.
Carmen was a mixed-up kid
who committed suicide.

558
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,215
Look at the evidence,
you dumb bastards.

559
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,718
Evidence you manufactured.
You cut 10 seconds
off that security tape.

560
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,582
How many more cover-ups
you think this clown's got?

561
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,678
I don't have to
Iisten to this.

562
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,848
You've been off
the job so Iong
you forgot the Iaw.

563
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:26,982
Yeah, what Iaw?

564
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,051
The ones you broke, hindering
a police investigation,
tampering with evidence.

565
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,994
Make yourself at home.

566
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,364
I'm sorry
to have kept you
waiting, Detectives.

567
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,133
I was getting changed.

568
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,304
My son isn't back from
the city yet and I'm afraid
I have to go out.

569
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,778
Yet another
charity dinner.

570
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,815
Mrs. Lamerly, we need
to speak with your grandson.

571
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,407
But that's not possible,
Drew's my escort tonight.

572
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,077
Detectives, what is it?

573
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,053
We know that you were
in the penthouse with Carmen.

574
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,384
So what'd you do
to her up there?

575
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,923
What are you
talking about?

576
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,688
He was with us that night.
Tell them, Drew.

577
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,161
Look, can we do
this somewhere else?
My grandmother's not well.

578
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,720
Drew, we know
about the cover-up.

579
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,699
Are you saying
Drew hurt that girl?
That's not possible.

580
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,133
He couldn't do
such a thing.

581
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,193
Oh, yeah?
Jenny White.

582
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,200
That name mean
anything to you?

583
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,766
(SIGHS)

584
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,878
I knew this would
come out eventually.

585
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,245
I told you,
I told your father.
He wouldn't Iisten.

586
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,145
You told him what?

587
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,177
That Drew should
take his punishment
for hurting Jenny.

588
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:31,884
So you admit
that he did it?

589
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,489
Well, why didn't you speak up
then instead of shipping him
off to Paris?

590
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,496
One's instinct is to protect
one's children, Detective.

591
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,690
But I insisted
Drew get help.

592
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,030
Six months in
a psychiatric hospital.

593
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,297
He was a child then.
He's grown up now.

594
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,599
And become a murderer.

595
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,032
Drew didn't do
anything to Carmen.

596
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,841
Test him.

597
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,278
You have Iie detectors,
don't you? Test him.

598
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,179
If he didn't kill Carmen,
who did?

599
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,283
Tom Paysen,
our security man.

600
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,380
He was obsessed with Carmen.
He wasn't here on Saturday
night.

601
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,324
How can I make
you believe me?

602
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,020
Take the polygraph test.

603
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,129
HUANG: How would you
describe your childhood?
Was it happy or unhappy?

604
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,962
Pretty happy.

605
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,569
Did you get along
with your parents?

606
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,475
It's...
Am I being tested yet?

607
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,641
This is
the pre-test interview.

608
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,080
I asked you about
your relationship
with your parents.

609
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:40,185
Well, I mean,
it's okay, I guess.

610
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,521
My mom is not well.
Hasn't been for a while.

611
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,597
Dad's working
all the time.

612
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,759
So I guess you could say
we're mutually indifferent.

613
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,227
MAN: We're set.

614
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,634
I'm going to
show you some cards

615
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,332
and I'm going
to try to guess
what each one of them is.

616
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,838
You must answer no
even if I guess correctly.

617
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,944
Is it the four of hearts?

618
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,106
No.

619
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,910
Is it the king of spades?

620
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,181
No.

621
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,224
Is it the eight of diamonds?

622
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,785
No.

623
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,053
It is the eight, isn't it?

624
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,732
HUANG: The graph clearly
registers the Iie.

625
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,565
No way out then, huh?

626
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,705
Are you ready?

627
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,375
Is your name Drew Lamerly?

628
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,542
Yes.

629
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,414
Have you ever
stolen from a friend?

630
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:43,914
No.

631
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,550
Have you ever forced a woman
to have sex with you?

632
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,287
Yes.

633
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,199
Was that woman
Jenny White?

634
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,603
Yes.

635
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,439
Did you force Carmen Trancoso
to have sex with you?

636
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,435
No.

637
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,640
Did you murder
Carmen Trancoso?

638
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:17,913
No.

639
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,863
The polygraph says
he's being truthful.

640
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,094
But I think he's Iying.

641
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,566
What, he's using
countermeasures?

642
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,865
Yeah, Iike a pebble
in the shoe,
breathing control.

643
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,405
Anything to manipulate
his body's
physiological response.

644
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,838
Well, how do you know
that from the test?

645
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,239
I ran a Control
Questions Test

646
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,402
which means that I included
non-relevant questions

647
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,537
which could still
provoke a guilty response.

648
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,876
Like, "Have you ever
stolen from a friend?"

649
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,006
HUANG: Right.

650
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,880
Drew was taught
how to spot
the control questions

651
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,476
and how to adjust
his body's response
accordingly.

652
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,386
The polygraph shows a guilty
response for, "Have you ever
stolen from a friend?"

653
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:00,196
But almost no response
for the relevant question,

654
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,256
"Did you murder
Carmen Trancoso?"

655
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,591
Well, couldn't that
mean he is innocent?

656
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,103
It could, but I think
he fooled the machine.

657
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,606
He ramped up
his body's response
to the control questions

658
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,608
to cover up his Iies
about killing Carmen.

659
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,974
He wanted to take the test.
He knew he'd pass.

660
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,307
HUANG: Exactly.

661
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,336
Captain.

662
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,280
You get anything
out of Tom Paysen?

663
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,978
He denies murdering
the girl and won't
roll over on the kid.

664
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,714
Even though
the Lamerlys
gave him up.

665
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,551
He's a cop.
He knows we have
no case against him.

666
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,353
Even if you get him for
tampering, the most he'II
get is a couple of years.

667
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,155
And one hell of
a Christmas bonus.

668
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:33,789
If we can't put Drew on that
balcony with Carmen,
we got no case against him.

669
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,127
Thanks.

670
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,101
Maybe we do.
CSU found something.

671
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,633
There are traces of suede
in the abrasions on
the heel of Carmen's shoe.

672
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,904
BIue-dyed calfskin,
pretty nice material.

673
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,740
So it Iooks Iike something
caught in the heel,
Iike a blue suede jacket.

674
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,211
Is that enough
for a warrant?

675
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,407
How many suede jackets are
running around Manhattan?

676
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,383
This suede was produced
by a toxic tanning process.

677
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,476
For starters,

678
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,681
they used a hexavalent
instead of a polyvalent
chrome to clean the Ieather.

679
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,848
Okay, which means?

680
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,360
Not made in the U.S.
Probably comes from
one of your Baltic states.

681
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,794
If your perp has the jacket,
I can match it.

682
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,561
What's going on?

683
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,126
We have a warrant to
search Drew's room.

684
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,933
What on earth for?

685
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:22,811
Kid's got taste.

686
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,314
Detectives,
can I help you?

687
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,009
We're helping ourselves,
thanks.

688
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,244
EIIiot.

689
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,423
Heel made
an impression.

690
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,288
Drew Lamerly,
turn around. Turn around.

691
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,426
You're under arrest
for the murder of
Carmen Trancoso.

692
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,491
You have the right
to remain silent.
If you give up that right,

693
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,696
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court
of Iaw.

694
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,466
You have the right
to an attorney...

695
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,139
Okay, want to deal?

696
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,641
Getting cold feet,
Lorna?

697
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:56,839
Hardly.

698
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,248
Man two. He does five years
in a psychiatric institution.

699
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,950
Your client inflicts
a terrifying death
on a young woman

700
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,013
and you want him
to get counseling?

701
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,524
No. Murder two.
He does 25 years.

702
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,821
No, thanks.

703
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,589
The results of
Drew's psych eval.

704
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,290
Here's your notice.

705
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,197
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

706
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,531
Diminished capacity
caused by brutalization
at the hands of his father?

707
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,198
You've got to be joking.

708
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,605
See if the jury Iaughs.

709
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,637
Well, it's an
impressive tactic.

710
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,911
Brutalization is part of
criminologist Lonnie Athens'
violentization theory.

711
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,214
Another Iame excuse
for criminal behavior?

712
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,344
Not necessarily.

713
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,889
Athens believes that
violent environment
and example

714
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,618
are the cause of all
violent criminal acts.

715
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,024
What, no interest in genetics
or brain chemistry?

716
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,152
No.

717
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,719
Athens interviewed a hundred
convicted violent criminals

718
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,595
and found that they were
all abused as children.

719
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,258
AII saw family
members brutalized

720
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,132
and were all taught
to use extreme violence

721
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,763
in response to stressful
and threatening situations.

722
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,535
We found nothing
that even hints
Drew was abused.

723
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,939
How am I going
to fight this?

724
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,500
By using Drew's
own words.

725
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,507
Defense claims
that Drew's
father abused him.

726
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,549
But in his polygraph
interview with me,

727
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,243
Drew said that his
relationship with his father

728
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,047
was one of mutual
indifference.

729
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,920
SCARRY: Was Drew's
childhood happy?

730
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,919
It was comfortable,
not happy.

731
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,362
Why not?

732
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,728
He always had to succeed.

733
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,826
At school,
at sports,
at everything.

734
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,164
And if he didn't?

735
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,361
He was punished.

736
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,770
By whom?

737
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,869
By whom,
Mrs. Lamerly?

738
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,449
His father.
My son, Douglas.

739
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,683
Did his mother
not protect him?

740
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,847
Grace tried,
but she was
terrified of Douglas.

741
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,186
That's why
she turned to alcohol.

742
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,819
Several years ago
she checked herself
into a clinic in Bermuda

743
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,022
and Drew hasn't
seen her since.

744
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,361
Did Douglas
ever beat Drew?

745
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,798
Yes.

746
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,598
After a flunked
test or a Iost game.

747
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,369
Douglas said failure reflected
badly on the family,
made Drew Iess of a man.

748
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:10,110
Your Honor,
I am showing the witness
Defense Exhibit Three.

749
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,684
Mrs. Lamerly,
do you recognize
this x-ray?

750
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,845
Drew's broken arm.

751
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,446
He got in a fight
at a hockey game,

752
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,618
and when he came home,
Douglas threw him
down the stairs.

753
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,593
Because he had
been in a fight?

754
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,028
Because he didn't
win the fight.

755
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,090
What happened
the next fight
that Drew was in?

756
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,832
He had to be pulled
off the other boy.
He nearly killed him.

757
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,898
So he had Iearned
the violent Iesson
his father had taught him?

758
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,374
Yes.

759
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,604
Thank you.

760
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:48,311
Mrs. Lamerly, you don't seem
to have a problem exposing
your own son in court.

761
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,911
I am mortified.

762
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:54,253
Douglas is my only son.
I failed him.

763
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,453
Don't mock me for
trying to redeem
myself with my grandson.

764
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,262
You say that your son
often abused Drew,

765
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,733
but in his interviews
with the police,
Drew never mentioned that.

766
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,099
In fact, Drew said...

767
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,606
Your Honor, the interview
to which the A.D.A. refers
was with a psychiatrist.

768
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:10,834
It's privileged.

769
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,638
Mr. Lamerly volunteered to do
the interview, Your Honor.

770
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,509
He was talking to
an FBI psychiatrist
in a police precinct.

771
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,175
A psychiatrist
is a psychiatrist.

772
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,718
My client had
the expectation
of privacy.

773
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,721
I'm sorry, Miss Cabot,
the interview is out.

774
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,992
You say that Douglas
taught Drew violence.

775
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,919
Did he also
teach him to rape?

776
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,090
He showed him
how to abuse women.

777
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,895
Drew's mother
will testify to that.

778
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,731
Unfortunately,
she's in Bermuda.

779
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,600
So do you have
some other examples?

780
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,832
He taught him to think
that women can be bought.

781
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,174
So does the advertising
industry.

782
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,647
The fact is that
Douglas didn't teach
Drew to rape, did he?

783
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,775
Drew Iearned
that all on his own.

784
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,079
No.

785
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,916
From the age of 13,

786
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,659
Douglas took my grandson
to have sexual encounters
with prostitutes.

787
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,991
Buy a woman,
you can do anything
you want with her.

788
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:14,194
Mrs. Lamerly assassinates
her son and turns her
grandson into the victim.

789
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,705
I couldn't put
a dent in her.

790
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,798
Jury's buying this
brutalization crap, huh?

791
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,070
Well, so far
the evidence
supports it.

792
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,578
Drew got into fights,
he beat up Jenny White.

793
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,205
Maybe his dad
did brutalize him.

794
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,476
BENSON: You don't
believe that.

795
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,951
If Drew was a gang kid
with no dad and a mother
who was on crack,

796
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,113
we wouldn't blame them
for using an environment
defense.

797
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,713
I do blame
his environment.

798
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,782
He's a spoiled rich kid
whose family helps him get
away with rape and murder.

799
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,088
What can we do, AIex?

800
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,220
Well, the defense is going
to use violentization to say

801
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,458
that Drew was not
responsible for
his actions.

802
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,592
Carmen threatens him
and Drew's Iearned
response is violence.

803
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,035
So in a rush of rage,
he pushes her off the roof.

804
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,303
If we could prove
that there were
other cases

805
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,172
where Drew acted
violently without
provocation,

806
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,144
then we might
have a chance.

807
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,505
But who'II testify
against him?

808
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,453
Jennifer, we really
need you to testify.

809
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,648
No. I can't.

810
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,317
You're going to Iet
Drew Lamerly get away
with rape and murder.

811
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,859
Very much,
will you
please just go?

812
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,360
I understand what
you have to Iose.

813
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,624
We've got to stop this guy,
and we can't do it
without you.

814
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,926
What's going on, Jen?

815
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,059
I can't. It's nothing.
Misunderstanding.

816
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,228
Who are you?
What do you want?

817
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,601
Police, Special Victims.

818
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,072
We were hoping we could speak
to your wife about something
that happened to her.

819
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,267
What?

820
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,537
It was before
you knew her.

821
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,010
It's not important,
Angus.

822
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,438
I know about
Jenny's past.

823
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,288
Well, maybe you don't
know the whole story.

824
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,620
She's my wife. Try me.

825
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,717
Drew said he
needed a date.

826
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,122
He bought me a dress,
picked me up in his car.

827
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,566
For a while it was
as if I really was...

828
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:52,898
His prom date.

829
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,831
Yeah.

830
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,401
But Drew had been drinking.

831
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,174
He pulled me into a room,
started to have sex.

832
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,580
I went along with it.

833
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,951
After all,
that's how
I made my Iiving.

834
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:17,085
But suddenly he
slaps me and says,

835
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,756
"I'm not paying you
to enjoy it, bitch."

836
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,863
He ripped my dress.

837
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,369
He hit me
again and again.

838
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,069
And he raped me.

839
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,968
He treat any of the other
girls the same way?

840
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,515
A couple said
he'd hit them.

841
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,415
But he was easier
to handle then.

842
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,113
He was 13, 14.

843
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,816
When his father
first brought him?

844
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,689
No, that was the sickest
thing about Drew.

845
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,489
He came with
his grandmother.

846
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,427
She'd pick
his girls for him.

847
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,805
I told Carmen
that it was over.

848
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:09,334
She got really upset,
ran out on the balcony.

849
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:14,612
And I tried to calm her,
but she screamed at me,
hit me.

850
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,314
And then something
inside just snapped.

851
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,584
You... You saw red?

852
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,852
Yes.

853
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,057
She kept on screaming
and kicking at me

854
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,265
and I pushed her
against the railing

855
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,626
and I just pushed
her and pushed her
until she fell.

856
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,696
SCARRY: Drew, did you
mean to kill her?

857
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,103
No, God, no.

858
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,736
Thank you.

859
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:53,814
Remind us again, Mr. Lamerly,
how did you break your arm?

860
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,555
I told you, my dad did it.

861
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,795
CABOT: Really?

862
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,265
Because I have affidavits
from your former headmaster

863
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,966
and the teacher
who took you to the ER,

864
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,100
and they could swear
that you did break
your arm playing hockey.

865
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,771
They remember because
they were afraid your parents
were going to sue.

866
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,336
Your Honor, we haven't
seen any of these.

867
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,873
It's the People's 23,
People's 24.

868
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,919
Go on, Miss Cabot.

869
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,478
So tell us again, Mr. Lamerly,
how did you break your arm?

870
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,084
Your father didn't do it.

871
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,192
He didn't touch you, did he?

872
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,228
Yes. Yes, he did.

873
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,831
Mr. Lamerly,
do you recognize
this woman?

874
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,272
No, I don't.

875
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,172
Her name is Jennifer White

876
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:50,771
and I have a sworn
affidavit from her
as well, the People's 25,

877
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,510
that states that you
attacked and raped her
without provocation...

878
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,482
Your Honor...

879
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,180
...which
expressly contradicts
your violentization defense.

880
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,414
Your Honor!

881
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,650
The jury will disregard
the Iast statement.

882
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,419
Miss Cabot,
watch your step.

883
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,858
Your Honor, I'm trying
to establish that

884
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,987
Mr. Lamerly's entire
defense is a Iie.

885
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,792
Then stick to
the facts in evidence.

886
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,095
Do not try to
introduce new material.

887
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,328
You testified that
your father took you
to a brothel. Is that true?

888
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,499
Yes.

889
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,567
May I remind you
that you are under oath.

890
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,475
I told you, it was him.

891
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,275
Who took you, Mr. Lamerly?

892
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,680
Stop it! Enough!
That's enough!

893
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,910
(GROANING)

894
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,184
SCARRY: Your Honor,
we need a doctor!

895
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,915
Order! Order in the court!

896
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,015
How could you do
such a thing, you bitch?
It's all your fault!

897
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,185
You're going to pay for this!
You're going to pay for this!

898
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,752
You can trust me on that!
Get off of me! Get off of me!

899
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,762
Get him out of here.
Settle down!

900
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,492
Grandma!

901
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,574
Mother, it's the police.

902
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,110
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Lamerly?

903
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,236
I'II survive.

904
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,506
I hope so.

905
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,014
Long enough for you
to stand trial, anyway.

906
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,448
What are you
talking about?

907
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,612
Conspiracy, perjury, hindering
a prosecution. Do you want me
to go on?

908
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,279
You can't prove
a damn thing.

909
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,189
We can. Douglas told
us everything

910
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,527
and now you'II be
joining Drew in prison.

911
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,328
What have you done?

912
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,431
I Iet you turn my son
into a monster.

913
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,093
You are nothing.

914
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,603
I built this family,
I kept it strong.

915
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,835
You never Ioved
Drew Iike I did.
I made him a man.

916
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,672
I made him a man.

917
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,639
You are nothing!

918
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,203
You never were anything!
You're nothing!
