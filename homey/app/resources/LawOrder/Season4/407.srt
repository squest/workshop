1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,097
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,866
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,032
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,077
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,636
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,341
These are their stories.

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,345
DAVE: My girlfriend,

8
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,910
she hates that I do this.
She wants me to quit.

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,286
JOE: She won't complain
when you find her
that diamond ring.

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,346
'Cause that happens?

11
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,619
Oh, man!
You wouldn't believe

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,594
the stuff folks
throw away. Oh!

13
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,721
Oh, what the hell
is that?

14
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,026
I don't
smell nothing.

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,397
Oh, man, you're crazy.
That thing stinks.

16
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,028
It may smell bad,
but the pay is good.

17
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,765
Not good enough.

18
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:43,331
Break up that mass
before it jams
the grinder.

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,607
The damn thing's stuck.

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,977
Let me see that.

21
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,609
Is that a hand?
Holy mother of God.

22
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,753
M.E. says she's five,
maybe six years old.
Raped and murdered.

23
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,120
Came in with
a Ioad of garbage.

24
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,954
Where from?
Commercial dumpster.

25
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,324
Half the carting
companies in the city
offload here.

26
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,159
Is there any way to tell
which truck
brought the body in?

27
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,028
PIant manager says
they get more than
a hundred trucks

28
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,192
in here every day,

29
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,704
and they all dump in one heap
that feeds into the maw.

30
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,398
You see everything
on that belt?

31
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,839
Yeah, what about it?

32
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,002
Once the M.E. is done,
I want you to bag up
everything on it.

33
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,170
Swell.

34
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,770
WARNER: Cause of death
was Iigature strangulation.

35
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,076
And the sexual assault?

36
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,845
Injuries to the genitalia
show no signs of healing.

37
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,511
Raped close
to the time of death,

38
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,021
but that was a while ago.

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,888
Her skin is shriveled.
Mummification?

40
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,051
Exactly.

41
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,459
The body was stored
before it was dumped.

42
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,156
I'II know more
after an autopsy.

43
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,323
It'II be tough
to make an ID

44
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,866
with her face
damaged Iike that.

45
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,958
Definitely post-mortem,

46
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,469
probably from the
garbage truck blades.

47
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,631
She was a fighter.
Take a Iook at this.

48
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,543
BIonde hair.
Maybe she got a piece of him.

49
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,944
I sure hope so.

50
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,598
STABLER: Tell me
you've got his DNA.

51
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,032
Sorry. The blonde hairs
that were found in her hand

52
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,694
turned out to be synthetic.

53
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,795
From a wig?
Maybe.

54
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,396
I'm sending the fibers
over to the Iab

55
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,533
to be checked against
the FBI database.

56
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,167
We at Ieast know
how Iong ago she died?

57
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,007
Based on
the insect activity,

58
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,776
I'd say between
six and eight weeks ago.

59
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,909
Judging from
the mummification,

60
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,748
the body was kept
in a cool place.

61
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,685
Can we get an ID
from the dental records?

62
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,156
I doubt it. Look at this.

63
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,487
There's so much tooth decay,

64
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,756
it's unlikely
she ever saw a dentist.

65
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,888
We'II definitely need
a facial reconstruction.

66
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,162
I'II send the body to our
forensic anthropologist.

67
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,827
He'II also try
to raise fingerprints.

68
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,531
So that's it?

69
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:30,235
Except for a few details
that will break your heart.

70
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,834
Displacement of her
front teeth

71
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,845
suggests she sucked
her thumb.

72
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,574
And she Iiked jumping rope.

73
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,775
BENSON: How'd you get that?

74
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,442
The scuffed toes.

75
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,147
I ruined enough pairs
when I was her age.

76
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,780
A five-year-old
kid disappears

77
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,221
and nobody reports it?

78
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,349
We checked her dental x-rays

79
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,087
against every missing
five-to-seven-year-old

80
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,959
African-American girl
in the Tri-State. No match.

81
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,828
Someone snatches your kid,
you call 91 1.

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,162
Unless you don't want
anybody to know

83
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,293
that your kid's gone.

84
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,668
So we're thinking this girl
was raped and killed
in her own home?

85
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,730
If the perp is a parent,
it explains why
there's no report.

86
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,106
And if she's not in school,
she's the perfect victim.

87
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,737
Nobody outside the family
would even know she's missing.

88
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,304
We don't even know
where she's missing from.

89
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,111
The garbage might tell us.

90
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,549
The Iab should have
gone through it by now.

91
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,611
OIivia, EIIiot, quicker we get
her picture out there,

92
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,054
quicker somebody
recognizes her.

93
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,125
DR. CONSTANTINE:
Meet Cherish Doe.

94
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,687
STABLER: What, Jane Doe's
not good enough?

95
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,130
It's too impersonal.

96
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,224
A cute Iittle girl
with braids

97
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,702
deserves something better,
don't you think?

98
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,407
Femur Iength,
plus the Iack of
epiphyseal plate fusion,

99
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,137
I'd say Cherish can't be
more than six.

100
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,371
So were you able
to get prints?

101
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,209
Still working on it.

102
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,442
Do you want to share?

103
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,007
The fingertips
were too shriveled.

104
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,815
So you cut her hands off.

105
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,413
I disarticulated them.

106
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,550
They're soaking
in embalming fluid

107
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,786
to reinflate the tissue,

108
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,421
hopefully enough
to roll a print.

109
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,021
TREVOR: You guys
owe me big time.

110
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,998
You find an address
in all that swill?

111
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,126
No, but I did find
an unusual amount

112
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,760
of fast food wrappers,
coffee cups,

113
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,805
fish scraps
and stained cotton balls.

114
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,704
-Cotton balls?
-From a nail salon.

115
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,800
Yeah, which apparently
shares a dumpster

116
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,505
with a burger joint,
a coffee shop
and a fish market.

117
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,945
That Ieaves, what,
only a couple dozen places
for us to check out?

118
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,880
How many city blocks
we gonna have to walk?

119
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,942
None, if you can manage
to drag your asses
over to the computer.

120
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,112
I've plugged you
your coffee shops,

121
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,951
burger joints,
fish markets, nail salons

122
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,287
into the zoning
and business permit databases.

123
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,452
You still think Big Brother
isn't watching us?

124
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,927
Now we eliminate areas
where all the variables

125
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,793
don't coexist
in close proximity.

126
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,458
Well, the garbage
plant's way uptown

127
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,058
and the manager says

128
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,501
they only pick up dumpsters
from north of 96th Street.

129
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,562
No problem.
In goes the information...

130
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,005
And out comes one Iocation.

131
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,478
1 23rd and Lenox. There we go.

132
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,241
Bingo! Burger Land.
Nail salon.

133
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,477
There's Letty's
Coffee Shop

134
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,213
and the back
of the fish market.

135
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,084
Why do we always get
the trash detail?

136
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,124
'Cause we're the right men
for the job.

137
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,292
PIus we've got the will
and we got the skill.

138
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,629
BIoody bed sheet.

139
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,225
You think the bastard
wrapped her body in it?

140
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,292
Mmm-hmm.

141
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,636
AII those windows up there,
maybe somebody saw him.

142
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,003
CSU have any Iuck
with the dumpster?

143
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,339
FIN: The blood type
on the bed sheets

144
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,879
match the victim.
That's it.

145
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,209
MUNCH: Nothing on
the canvass, either.

146
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,373
Maybe our car will improve

147
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,438
once we get these
on the street.

148
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,882
WOMAN ON TV:
Police today are searching
for the killer...

149
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,613
Looks Iike somebody
beat us to it.
...of this little girl,

150
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,155
found in this
Upper Manhattan garbage plant.

151
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,350
The only clue
to the killer's identity,

152
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,861
Iong blonde hairs
found in the victim's
lifeless grasp.

153
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,419
How the hell
did they get that?

154
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,728
Somebody gave them the fiber.
That detail was our hold-back.

155
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,234
Now when every nut in town
starts making
false confessions,

156
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,702
we got no way
to screen them out.

157
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,397
BENSON: We must've passed out
a couple hundred flyers.

158
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,635
Nobody recognized her.

159
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,905
Are we wrong thinking
she's from the neighborhood?

160
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,413
Maybe he is.
He stored her body
for a month or two,

161
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,948
he dumps her in a place
close to his house.

162
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,381
I mean, where's he
gonna go with her?

163
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,975
Sounds Iike
he's in his comfort zone.

164
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,485
Paroled sex offenders?

165
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,886
We checked.
No pedophiles
registered in the area.

166
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,150
Who says he's registered?

167
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,748
We don't even know
if the perp's a stranger

168
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,088
or the Iittle girl's parent.

169
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,823
Or some transvestite
wearing a blonde wig.

170
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,364
MUNCH: We canvassed.
Nobody remembers seeing

171
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,367
a Iittle black girl
with a guy with blond hair.

172
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,300
Well, I guess that Ieak
to the media paid off.

173
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,928
Community Relations
just called,

174
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,530
there's a candlelight
vigil tonight for Cherish Doe.

175
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,165
How many times
have we collared predators

176
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,334
at their victims' funerals?

177
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,877
Let's flush him out.

178
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,778
Make sure he sees us,
maybe we'II see him.

179
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:32,908
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

180
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,684
REV. ALLASTAIR: Cherish Doe,
we gather here
to remember you.

181
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:42,251
A sweet, innocent child,
stolen from life too soon.

182
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,394
We stand here tonight
as your family,

183
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,525
until your own family
is found.

184
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,226
It's all clear
over here. EIIiot?
We will not forget.

185
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,037
Nothing on this side.

186
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,233
And we will not rest
until justice is done.

187
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,004
I call upon you

188
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,705
to search your memory
and your conscience.

189
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,242
Anything you recall

190
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,375
will be welcomed
by the police.

191
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,413
Thank you for your support.

192
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,689
We need every single lead
that you can provide.

193
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,288
Now if you recognize
Cherish Doe, please call us.

194
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,267
NYPD has set up
a confidential tip line.

195
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,496
We don't need your names,

196
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,970
but we do need
your information.

197
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,968
MUNCH: Did you get
anything yet?

198
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,805
MORALES: So far, no hits
on the facial recognition
software.

199
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,004
FIN: What's your database?

200
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,640
AII known sex offenders
citywide whose victims
were under 10.

201
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,774
Huang's suggestion.

202
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,784
Yeah, but there's no guarantee
his mug shot's in there.

203
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,912
I mean, some guys
molest dozens of kids
before they're caught.

204
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,514
Your positive
attitude's a real joy.

205
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,753
What's up with that
Iady in the blue?

206
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,730
Why is she Iooking
around Iike that?

207
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,390
Zoom in on that Iady,
right there.

208
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,729
MORALES: Got her.

209
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,637
Something ain't right.
I'II be right back.

210
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,207
REV. ALLASTAIR: Cherish Doe,
you walked among us

211
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,246
as a stranger. But now

212
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,907
we call you our own.

213
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,876
You are our daughter.

214
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,183
Detective Tutuola.
Can I help you?

215
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,654
I can't find my daughter.

216
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,712
Okay, Iet's go to the front

217
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,917
and make a missing
child announcement.

218
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,620
No, no. I don't mean here,
not tonight.

219
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,526
When?
I don't know when.

220
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,155
I'm not sure when.

221
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,223
Okay, okay. What's your name?

222
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,201
Violet Tremain.

223
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,329
I saw Cherish Doe on the news,
I had to come here...

224
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,569
She may be my Iittle girl.

225
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,803
She Iooks just Iike my Nina.

226
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,044
I just came back tonight.

227
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,280
I was gone
for five months upstate.

228
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,016
FIN: Doing time?

229
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,148
No, I...

230
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,717
I was in rehab.

231
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,328
I'm not a crack addict,
if that's what you think.

232
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,129
I'm a painter
and I do graphic design

233
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,499
to pay the bills.

234
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,095
I'm not judging you.

235
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,470
We were in a car accident.

236
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,238
My husband, Nina's father,
was killed and...

237
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,607
I messed up my back

238
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,080
and I couldn't work
without painkillers.

239
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,344
I got hooked,
but I'm clean now,
four months.

240
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,147
ACS took your daughter away.

241
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,188
I knew if I put Nina
in foster care

242
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,246
I might not get her back.

243
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,791
So I Ieft her with a neighbor.

244
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,087
Well, that shows
a Iot of trust

245
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,752
to Ieave your daughter
with a neighbor.

246
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,354
Mrs. Hawkins was Iike
a grandmother to Nina,

247
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,728
she watched her
ever since she was a baby

248
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,027
and never took a penny.

249
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,227
She Ioved Nina.

250
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,792
You check in on her?

251
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,834
I couldn't call from rehab,
so I wrote Ietters.

252
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,275
I started to worry
when a Ietter I sent
Iast week was returned.

253
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,539
And then I saw the news.

254
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,478
And you checked out of rehab.

255
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,311
No, I just Ieft.

256
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,444
I called Mrs. Hawkins,
the phone was disconnected.

257
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,978
I called another neighbor,
she said Mrs. Hawkins
was dead.

258
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,287
She passed away six weeks ago.

259
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,327
And no one knew
what happened to Nina.

260
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,628
Sit down.

261
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,167
You've got to tell me
more about Nina.

262
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,731
How old is she?

263
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,744
She's five.
Her birthday was Iast month.

264
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,878
She's smart.

265
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,314
She can't wait
to start school.

266
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,821
She's playing all the time.

267
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,181
The child has a Iot of energy.

268
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,056
She Iike to jump rope?

269
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,151
Yeah, all the time.

270
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,923
What about the dentist?
When was her Iast checkup?

271
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,557
A couple of years.

272
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,898
I freelance
and my husband didn't...

273
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,903
He didn't have
dental insurance.

274
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,667
It's my Nina, isn't it?

275
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,406
We don't know that for sure.

276
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,607
Well, I have to see her.
No, no...

277
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,116
No sense in getting ahead
of ourselves, okay?

278
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,482
Somebody probably
took her in

279
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,851
and didn't know
how to get in touch with you.

280
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,219
Then we have to Iook for her.

281
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,782
It's after 12:00.
There's nothing
we can do right now.

282
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,795
How can I get in touch
with you tomorrow?

283
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,764
I don't know, I haven't
figured that out yet.

284
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,761
Don't worry,
I'II take care of that.

285
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:22,904
Violet's telling the truth.

286
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,375
"Junkies Iie all the time."
Your words.

287
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,433
You didn't talk to her.

288
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,979
Then Iet her see the body.

289
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,039
The child had no face.
No mother can handle that.

290
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,846
MUNCH: Sounds Iike
you're Iacking
a Iittle objectivity.

291
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,011
Why? 'Cause I'm not
handling things your way?

292
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,146
The department
doesn't have a budget
for Violet's hotel room.

293
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,020
You're paying for it,
aren't you?
So what?

294
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,423
Well, I guess
she is kind of cute.

295
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,894
Look, somebody knows
who took Nina

296
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,055
after Mrs. Hawkins died.

297
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,065
We've gotta canvass
her neighborhood. Let's go.

298
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,296
I still think you ought to
Iet her view the body.

299
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,162
Are you coming or what?

300
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,763
How do you even know
she has a kid?

301
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,001
Maybe she's using Cherish Doe
for a handout.

302
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,441
I pulled the
birth certificate myself.

303
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,001
So back off.

304
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,410
Lover's quarrel?

305
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,572
Gonna be a domestic dispute

306
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,047
if Munch don't get
out of my face.

307
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,914
Look, why don't Fin and I
go canvass
Mrs. Hawkins' building?

308
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,783
Good idea. We got dozens
of new Ieads in Iast night,

309
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,220
Munch and I will prioritize
and assign them out.

310
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,258
Come on. Let's go.

311
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,259
OId Iady died
a month and a half ago,
heart attack,

312
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,658
on her way home
from the market.

313
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,753
Nina with her?

314
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,923
Smart Iittle girl,
called 911 from a payphone.

315
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,990
Here it is, 3B.

316
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,630
FIN: Who cleaned
this place out?

317
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,728
Salvation Army.

318
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,603
You called them?
Mrs. Hawkins' daughter did.

319
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,699
Said everything
in here was junk,
told me to Iet them in.

320
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:31,902
Okay, and what about Nina?

321
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,104
Mrs. Hawkins' daughter
take her?
Yeah, right.

322
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,613
She said just because
her mama took in strays

323
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,739
didn't mean she had to.

324
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,044
Said the child
was my problem.

325
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,709
FIN: You try to reach
Nina's mother?

326
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,049
Violet never said
where she was going.
What could I do?

327
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,557
I had to send her
to Child Welfare,
hope for the best.

328
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,426
AII Nina could tell me
was that her mother went away.

329
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,590
Mrs. Tremain
didn't Ieave any names

330
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,634
or phone numbers
of any of her relatives.

331
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,566
Under the circumstances,
we had to classify Nina

332
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,694
as an abandoned child.

333
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,398
Nina's mother
didn't abandon her.

334
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,633
She voluntarily entered
into a rehab program.

335
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,767
Well, then she
should have come to us

336
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,175
instead of Ieaving her child

337
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,304
with an elderly neighbor
in failing health.

338
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,144
We could have placed
Nina voluntarily
while Violet was away.

339
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,651
Your agency doesn't
always make it easy

340
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,380
for parents to get
their children back.

341
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,649
Well, children are often
better off in foster care

342
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,281
than they are being
raised by addicts.

343
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,588
Violet's cleaned up
and she wants
her daughter back.

344
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,355
Yeah. Well, that's for
the courts to decide.

345
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,589
Mrs. Tremain's
gonna have to prove

346
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,563
that she can provide
a stable home environment

347
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,792
before we can release Nina.

348
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,630
Where's Nina Iiving?

349
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,862
I won't release
that information

350
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,301
if you're planning
to take the mother

351
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,032
on an unauthorized home visit.

352
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,074
You see the resemblance
to Nina Tremain?

353
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,837
This Iittle girl was raped,
murdered and tossed
in a dumpster.

354
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,970
Don't get in my way, Iady.

355
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,648
I placed her
with Thelma Price.

356
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,246
BENSON: Mrs. Price?
Yes?

357
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,484
I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Tutuola.

358
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,823
We'd Iike to talk to you
about Nina Tremain.

359
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,919
She's not here.

360
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,553
FIN: Where is she?
I don't know.

361
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,326
Ask Children's Services.

362
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,799
They said that they
placed her with you.

363
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,200
You don't believe me?

364
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,034
Take a Iook.

365
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,971
That child was nothing
but trouble.

366
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,066
Hyperactive, no manners,

367
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,303
always making a mess.

368
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,902
Well, when did they take her?

369
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,277
Must have been
over a month ago.

370
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,839
Then why did
Nina's case worker
tell us you had her?

371
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,045
Hell if I know.
That woman is Iazy.

372
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,712
Never makes a home visit.

373
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,517
Well, I find it hard
to believe Mrs. Preston

374
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,785
would forget to tell us
she took Nina.

375
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,053
She didn't take her.

376
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,392
It was some white guy
with dark hair.

377
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,987
Did you get his name?

378
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,327
I told you it was a month ago.

379
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,891
You expect me
to remember that?

380
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,868
BENSON: When was the Iast time
you saw Nina Tremain?

381
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,998
I'm gonna have to
check the file.

382
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,371
You got a memory problem?

383
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,601
I think it was Iast week.

384
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,769
Wrong answer.

385
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,539
It's possible
that I missed a visit.

386
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,581
Or more than one.

387
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,741
Even if I did,
it's hardly a police matter.

388
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,841
Wrong again.

389
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,146
Well, when you can't
make a visit,

390
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,777
you ever send
a colleague to cover?

391
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,118
A guy, maybe?
No, never.

392
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:02,421
No, then can you explain
why your records say

393
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,122
that you visited her
Iast Tuesday,

394
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,858
and Thelma Price says
you didn't.

395
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,162
That woman's a Iiar.
You're the Iiar, Iady!

396
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,099
Hey, I want my union rep.
BENSON: Yeah?

397
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,502
Well, why don't you tell
your union rep
that Nina Tremain is missing

398
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:17,235
and that you haven't seen her
in six weeks.

399
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,709
You were responsible
for this child's safety,

400
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,042
and you didn't even bother
to check on her.

401
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,604
This is not my fault.
Whose fault is it?

402
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,706
Do you know
what my job is Iike?

403
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,841
How big of a caseload I have?

404
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,215
There's no way
I can see every child.

405
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,277
If you're Iooking
for sympathy, you're barking
up the wrong tree.

406
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,754
Thelma Price was a good
foster mother.

407
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,848
I thought Nina
would be all right.

408
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,895
How could they Iet someone
just walk off with my child?

409
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,059
We don't know, but we're doing
everything we can to find him.

410
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,898
Now I need your help.

411
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,232
Anything.

412
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,672
Do you have something
with Nina's
fingerprints on it?

413
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:54,006
We draw together all the time.
I keep her pictures with me.

414
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,450
I guess it's Iike
having her here.

415
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,277
PIease be careful,
they're all I have.

416
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,051
We'II take good care
of them, I promise.

417
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,622
Violet, is this
Nina's handprint?

418
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,755
Yeah.

419
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,396
We made that together
Iast Thanksgiving.

420
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,563
The mother
authenticates that it's
the child's handprint.

421
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,768
Will it work?
Let's see.

422
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:29,007
The anthropologist
sent the hand over,
it's finally ready to print.

423
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,580
Couldn't ask for better.

424
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,915
People did their jobs,
this wouldn't have happened.

425
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,215
Sorry guys,
prints don't match.

426
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,312
Are you sure?

427
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,913
Not even close.

428
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,789
So Nina's not the dead girl.

429
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,329
Nina Tremain
might still be alive.

430
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,698
Two Iittle girls,
Iook Iike sisters,
from the same neighborhood,

431
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,963
tell me that's a coincidence.

432
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,028
Same guy that killed Cherish
might have Nina.

433
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,006
Are we sure it's the same guy?

434
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,975
He's got dark hair
when he took Nina

435
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,238
and a blonde wig
when he killed Cherish.

436
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,610
Well, maybe he played dress-up
before he killed her.

437
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,979
Maybe it's not even
a blonde wig
we're Iooking for.

438
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,178
I gotta tell Violet
that Cherish Doe
isn't her daughter.

439
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,915
Cherish's real name
is Susie Marshall.

440
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,984
How'd you get that?

441
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,222
Computer kicked out a match
to a KidPrint card on file.

442
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,356
Grandmother had her printed
during Safety Week.

443
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,129
I always thought
this day would come,

444
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,571
but not to hear
my grandbaby is dead.

445
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,600
I thought it would be Ronnie.

446
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,735
Who?

447
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,302
My daughter. The junkie.

448
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,816
That's why you were
taking care of Susie?

449
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,019
Ronnie'd ask me
to baby-sit her for a night

450
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,356
and disappear for months.

451
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,262
Then she'd come home
clean and sober,

452
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,026
and beg me to give Susie back.

453
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,900
And this Iast time I agreed,

454
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,996
because I thought that Ronnie

455
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,099
had finally
straightened herself out.

456
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,376
When did you Iast see
your granddaughter?

457
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,574
About five or six months ago.

458
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,085
Weren't you worried
because it had been so Iong?

459
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,179
Honestly, I was relieved.

460
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,459
Ronnie came by and told me
that a man from Child Welfare

461
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,154
had taken her away.

462
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,095
A perfect stranger
shows up at your door,

463
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,330
says he's a social worker,

464
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,632
and you just
turn over your kid

465
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,763
without a second thought?

466
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,535
Predator profiles his victims,

467
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,235
the kids come from
a chaotic household,

468
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,743
he knows they're not
gonna question him.

469
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,075
Posing as a social worker
is the perfect cover.

470
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,614
Well, that's true for Nina,

471
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,049
but ACS has no record
of contacting Susie Marshall
or her mother.

472
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,586
There's gotta be
another connection.

473
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,645
Well, take your pick.

474
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,054
Our perv either knows the kids
or their mothers.

475
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,184
What do we know
about the fathers?

476
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,728
Well, we know
Nina's father is dead

477
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,424
and Susie's father
went back to Jamaica.

478
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,467
We got a rap sheet
on Ronnie Marshall yet?

479
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,469
String of arrests,
collared for shoplifting
three years ago.

480
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,529
Last known whereabouts,
strung out on the street.

481
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,541
Then we got to go back
to Violet.

482
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,167
Show her pictures
of Ronnie and Susie.

483
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,872
Maybe she can
connect the dots.

484
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,779
VIOLET:
I'd remember this girl.

485
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,148
She Iooks just Iike my Nina.
I'm sorry.

486
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,084
FIN: How about this woman?

487
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,025
That scar.
I've seen her before.
Where?

488
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:32,222
An NA meeting.
I remember thinking
someone cut up her face.

489
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,992
Which NA meetings
did you go to?

490
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,263
Five o'clock
at the Community Center,

491
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,897
St. Virgil's on Tuesdays,
a few others
when the urge hit.

492
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,907
Well, the whole point of NA

493
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,705
is total confidentiality,
it's first names only.

494
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,446
They're not gonna talk to us.

495
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,538
I bet they'd talk to you.

496
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,518
What do you mean?

497
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,782
Your story might convince
a 12-stepper to open up.

498
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,183
FIN: You in?

499
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,556
What's he doing?

500
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,221
I'd do anything
to get my baby back.

501
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,858
Whatever it takes
to find Nina.

502
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,525
I'II do anything
I can to help.

503
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,966
But I'm not
gonna put a civilian

504
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,163
in the middle
of a criminal investigation.

505
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,762
Whatever you're thinking,
don't.

506
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,205
Violet's our only way in.

507
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,709
Violet would be acting
as an agent of the police.

508
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,211
Any evidence she obtains
could be excluded in court.

509
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,713
We're not Iooking
for evidence, Counselor.

510
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,009
We're Iooking for a Iead.

511
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,709
Nina Tremain
might still be alive.

512
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,911
We're talking about
violating the confidentiality

513
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,476
of a drug treatment program.

514
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,114
AIex, I tell people in AA

515
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,021
things I wouldn't want
my best friend to know.

516
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,457
Now I'd be the first
to agree with you

517
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,859
but I don't see how making
an appeal could hurt.

518
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,797
I would prefer
to get the information
through Iegal channels.

519
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,868
I'II get a subpoena.
CRAGEN: For what?

520
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,369
NA doesn't keep
membership Iists or records.

521
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,269
You want to tell that woman
you care more about the Iaw

522
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,570
than the Iife of her child?

523
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,269
She's Iiving a parent's
worst nightmare.

524
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,370
You think I really
had to run a number on her?

525
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,509
AII right.

526
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:01,109
But the only way we do this
is the right way.

527
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,312
Open meetings only.

528
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:06,153
Disclose your presence
and don't Iet Violet
out of your sight.

529
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,229
The Ninth Step says,

530
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,286
we have to make amends

531
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,959
to those harmed
by our addiction.

532
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,662
Well I... I harmed my baby.

533
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,578
Because I got high,
I couldn't take care of Nina,

534
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,944
and some monster
kidnapped her.

535
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,181
I have to find
Ronnie Marshall.

536
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,378
I think
she's been here before,

537
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,115
and she might
have some information.

538
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,850
Ain't that against the rules?

539
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,985
The only way I can get
my Iittle girl back
is with your help.

540
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,926
I have to find Ronnie.

541
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,896
This is her picture.

542
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,127
The same freak
who stole my Nina
murdered her daughter.

543
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,476
Time is running out.

544
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,774
If you know anything,
I am begging you to tell me.

545
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,541
Hey, what's the rush?
None of your business.

546
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:06,606
No, trust me,
it's my business.

547
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,709
I got nothing to say.

548
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,617
Then why are you running
Iike a Iittle scared rabbit?

549
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,315
I don't know nothing
about no missing kids.

550
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,880
But you do know
Ronnie Marshall.

551
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,118
I don't have to
tell you anything.

552
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,682
I respect
people's confidentiality.

553
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,092
How about respect
for the dead?

554
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,097
You think Ronnie
wants to attend her own
daughter's funeral?

555
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,894
This is for real?
It's not a scam?

556
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,094
You got my word.
I don't know, man,

557
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,397
people won't trust me
if I talk to a cop.

558
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,768
We never talked.

559
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,765
A place Ronnie and I
used to get high.

560
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,469
The Starlite Lounge.

561
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,335
Oh, yeah.
Ronnie used to come in.

562
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,472
Used to?

563
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,572
A while back.

564
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,947
Threw her out
for shooting up in the can.

565
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,486
Haven't seen her since.

566
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,488
Do you know
where we can find her?

567
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,751
I don't get personal
with the customers.

568
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,588
They pay, they drink,
they Ieave.

569
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,151
Any customers talk to Ronnie?

570
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,457
Only guys
who were drunk enough

571
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,294
to think
she Iooked good.

572
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,162
She'd go with a Ieper
for the price of a fix.

573
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,725
Any Iepers around here?

574
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,567
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

575
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,338
Hey, Pat!

576
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,068
You banged that
skanky chick once, right?
Ronnie?

577
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,338
The one with the scar?

578
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,210
Don't remind me.
This bitch boosted my wallet.

579
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,874
You go to her place?

580
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,783
Woman's shelter
don't allow guests.

581
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,445
We did it in a alley.

582
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,421
You know which shelter?

583
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,628
FIN: You see Ronnie anywhere?
VIOLET: No.

584
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,964
Wait. There she is.
This is Ronnie.

585
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,967
Ronnie Marshall?

586
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,469
Leave me alone.
I have a couple more hours.

587
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,138
Wake up, Ronnie.

588
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,114
Who the hell are you?

589
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,210
I'm a cop.
I didn't do nothing.

590
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,723
Who's she?
I'm Violet.

591
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,359
I'm Iooking for my daughter,
and I need your help.

592
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,790
Cost you twenty bucks,
I'II help you all you want.

593
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,201
We've got no time for games.

594
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,967
We think the same man
took your daughter.

595
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,905
No.

596
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,001
No. Social worker
took my baby.

597
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,070
That man
wasn't a social worker.

598
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,945
Oh, no? Who was he?

599
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,353
Look, I'm sorry,
but Susie's dead.

600
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,155
We found her body
two days ago.

601
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,357
She's better off.

602
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,794
That's how much you care
about your Iittle girl?

603
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,340
Come on, get your ass up.
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,701
You Iook Iike crap, Ronnie.

605
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,438
When are you
gonna Iet me out of here?

606
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,037
Orange juice.
You're gonna need it.

607
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,308
What do you want from me?

608
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,979
Description of the man
who took Susie
for a sketch artist.

609
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,249
I can't remember
back that far.
Can I go now, huh?

610
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,585
Look, I found your works.

611
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,455
You don't cooperate,
I'm gonna bust you.

612
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:02,959
What is your problem?

613
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,792
Your daughter's dead
and there's not one cell
in your junkie body

614
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,957
that gives a damn.

615
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,831
That man who took
my daughter was right.

616
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,200
I'm not fit to be a mom.

617
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,762
Susie deserved more than me.

618
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,204
Now she's gone,
and there's nothing
that I can do

619
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,371
that's gonna change that.

620
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,780
You could help us save
this other Iittle girl.

621
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,818
Make it right for Susie.

622
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,817
We got to get
a description of this guy.

623
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,484
You can do this.

624
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,050
(CRYING)

625
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,534
Thelma, Ronnie worked this up
with a sketch artist.

626
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,933
Does this Iook
Iike the man
who took Nina?

627
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,027
That's him.

628
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,402
There's got to be a connection
between this guy
and the three of you.

629
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,499
So both Ronnie and Violet
went to the same NA meeting.

630
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,770
Thelma, have you
ever been to one?

631
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:53,868
Never.

632
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,106
Maybe it wasn't the meetings,
but where they were held.

633
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,842
Ronnie and I
both went to St. Virgil's.

634
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,042
FIN: You go
to that church, Thelma?

635
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,778
No, First Baptist.

636
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,820
How about Haven House?
Never been there.

637
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,220
Ronnie, can you think
of anyplace else?
Anywhere at all?

638
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,553
Not really.

639
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,459
Come on, think.
Where did this guy see you?

640
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,123
Maybe at the Community Center
on Eighth Ave.

641
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,167
I stopped in there
a couple times.

642
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,863
I go there for Bingo Night.
Nina Iiked their playroom.

643
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,200
Oh, God,

644
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,797
I went to meetings there.
I took Nina with me.

645
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,880
He cut his hair
and shaved his beard,

646
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,143
and he never wore glasses,

647
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,946
but it could be Terry Jessup.

648
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,008
Who's that?

649
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,678
He worked here.
Quit a few months ago.

650
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,881
How Iong have you
known him?

651
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,823
Oh, most of his Iife.
He was a Iocal kid.

652
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,723
Just about grew up here.

653
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:46,059
Had a mother who was unstable.
Went on and off her meds.

654
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,462
ACS ever remove him?

655
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,022
Well, we called them
several times,

656
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,263
once when he had
a terrible burn
on his hand.

657
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,328
But, you know,
he told them
it was an accident.

658
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,600
What did Terry do here?

659
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,508
CIeaned up, you know,
took out the trash,
small repairs.

660
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,238
He used to fix
the broken toys.

661
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,212
That was his real passion.

662
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,078
So he was around
the kids?

663
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,585
He had quite
a doll collection.

664
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,018
He Ioved showing it to them.

665
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,456
Strange hobby
for an adult man,
collecting dolls.

666
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,186
He inherited them
from his mother.

667
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,524
Terry called them his Iegacy.

668
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,028
We're gonna need
to talk to Terry.

669
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,462
Do you have
an address for him?

670
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,263
I can't imagine
that Terry's in trouble
with the police.

671
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,735
Do you recognize
this Iittle girl?

672
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,797
That's Cherish Doe,
from the news?

673
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,240
Her real name
is Susie Marshall

674
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,743
and the other one
is Nina Tremain.

675
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,143
Oh, my God.

676
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,377
You do recognize them.

677
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,747
Just to say hi.

678
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,817
I can't believe it.

679
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,945
Did you ever see Terry
around either one of them?

680
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,182
No.

681
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,121
But he did pay
special attention

682
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,922
to the kids
with tough home Iives.

683
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,519
He said that they
needed extra Iove.

684
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,898
Damn it! We're too Iate.

685
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,663
Here we go.

686
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,935
The paper's
three months old.

687
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,670
Jessup must have taken off
after he kidnapped Susie.

688
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,940
He's got to have another place
where he stashed Susie's body

689
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,914
before he dumped her.

690
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,644
Got something over here.

691
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,482
Polaroid?

692
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,646
Susie Marshall.

693
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,020
Yeah, dressed up
Iike a Iittle doll.

694
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,461
Dolls are idealized
representations
of men and women.

695
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,865
They're pure,
perfect and sexless.

696
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,232
Terry Jessup
is Iike a child

697
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,203
who uses dolls
to act out his fantasies.

698
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,467
But he's a grown man
and his fantasies are sexual.

699
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,634
And he feels guilty
about being attracted
to children

700
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,541
and so he turns them
into dolls.

701
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,704
Which works for a while...

702
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,340
Until he gives in,
he has sex with the doll,

703
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,815
but then it's not
a doll anymore,
so he kills it.

704
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,045
Why stash the body?

705
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,711
Again, out of guilt.

706
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,278
And then when he finds
a new playmate,

707
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,914
he just discards the Iast one.

708
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,117
STABLER: Talked to your friend
at Bellevue,

709
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,387
got me the psych records
on Jessup's mother.

710
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,758
Diagnosed with
severe depression

711
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,694
with intermittent
bouts of mania.

712
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,595
She'd go around having
sex with dozens of men

713
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,568
and then go on
these spending sprees
buying nothing but dolls.

714
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,763
Give you anything on Jessup?

715
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:07,964
Well, the shrink said
that she was

716
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,564
intermittently abusive
and seductive towards him.

717
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,008
Perfect way
to raise a serial killer.

718
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,011
I talked to a couple
of Jessup's neighbors.

719
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,740
The stress of his mother's
death a year ago

720
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,214
pushed him over the edge.

721
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,148
He became reclusive
and explosive.

722
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,311
I just got off with CSU.

723
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,823
No forensic evidence
either Nina or Susie
were in Jessup's apartment.

724
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,982
Well, to keep
the girls prisoner,

725
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,322
Jessup would have
needed privacy and isolation.

726
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,952
STABLER: He snatched
both girls in the 'hood,

727
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,826
dumped Susie back there.

728
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,424
If he's following a pattern,
Nina's got to be nearby.

729
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,162
TREVOR: Check this out.

730
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,863
Moving in?

731
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,169
My own doll collection.

732
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,607
Fibers came from
a Madame Charlotte doll.

733
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,701
Very exclusive.

734
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,076
CRAGEN: Well, how exclusive
is their distribution?

735
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,115
Only three stores in the city.

736
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,118
Sure, I've known
Terry Jessup for years.

737
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,586
Not a Iot of guys
are into collecting,

738
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,644
but his money's good.

739
00:30:58,723 --> 00:30:59,849
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

740
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,516
Oh, it's a couple
of months ago.

741
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,221
He came in to buy
the new Princess AIexis.

742
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,923
Craftsmanship,
that's what Terry cares about.

743
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,296
Only perfect dolls
in mint condition.

744
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,891
We need an address for him.

745
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,527
I send mailings
to preferred customers

746
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,004
whenever a new
Madame Charlotte comes out.

747
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:18,201
Here we go.
2555 Eighth Avenue.

748
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,141
That's his old apartment.

749
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,542
Avid collector Iike Terry

750
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,513
surely sent you
a change of address.

751
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,639
No.

752
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,481
But he called
a couple of weeks ago.

753
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,213
Pre-ordered a Virginia Belle.

754
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,482
Left a number for me to call
when it came in.

755
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,684
917 area. Cell phone.

756
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,660
Call Terry and tell him
his order came in.

757
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,602
Terry, I'm sorry.
(SOFTLY) He just came in.

758
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,137
What's wrong?
After I called you,
I opened the box.

759
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,911
The shipment was damaged.

760
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,077
Would you take
a Princess Renee instead?

761
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,415
You know
I don't collect Renees.

762
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,251
The workmanship's shoddy.

763
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,850
How about
a 50th anniversary Nicolette,
Iimited edition?

764
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,966
Okay, but I still want
the Virginia Belle.

765
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,266
Promise. I'II call you.
Okay.

766
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,206
He's on the move.

767
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,165
STABLER: Police!
Let's see your hands.

768
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,932
Don't hurt me.
Don't move.

769
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,405
Where is she, Terry?
What?

770
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,942
On your knees.
Nina Tremain,
where is she?

771
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,307
Nina?
Tell us where Nina is,

772
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,005
before I take
your punk ass head off.

773
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,342
I don't know.
STABLER: Hey, Terry.

774
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,711
Terry!
Where's the top sheet?

775
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,046
Did you use this to wrap up
Susie Marshall's body?

776
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,847
Terry!

777
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,547
PIease don't hurt my dolls.

778
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,086
PIease don't.
Tell us where Nina is.

779
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,353
She's not here!

780
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,985
Get his ass up.

781
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,194
We ran Iine-ups.

782
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,929
We got positive IDs
from Thelma Price and Ronnie.

783
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,028
Nice job.

784
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,970
I don't need a confession
to win this case.

785
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,440
But we do need one
to find Nina Tremain.

786
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,306
Any chance
she's still alive?

787
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,608
Warner couldn't pin down
the exact time
of death for Susie.

788
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,079
AII we know is that
he kept her breathing

789
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,581
between two and four weeks.

790
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,708
And we're at
the four-week mark
with Nina right now.

791
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,275
If he killed her,
he'd be agitated.

792
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,820
He'd be on the prowl
for his next victim,

793
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:47,346
instead, he's in there
sleeping Iike a baby.

794
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,120
You know what?
Why don't you all
take a Iittle walk

795
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,660
while Terry and I
get better acquainted.

796
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,662
Now, he's not going
to respond to threats.

797
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,826
He's very Ionely.
Dolls and children
are his only companions.

798
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,562
He needs a friend.

799
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,262
Your dolls are beautiful.

800
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:02,898
I had Iots of dolls,

801
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,068
but never ones
as nice as yours.

802
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,340
Girls are Iucky.

803
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,747
They can play with dolls.
Boys aren't supposed to.

804
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,250
I had dolls.

805
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,410
You did? What kind?

806
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,818
You know,
GI Joe, Batman...

807
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,756
Those are action figures.

808
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,890
Terry, I hear that your mother
started your doll collection.

809
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,988
She Iiked beautiful things.

810
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,931
I inherited them
when she died.

811
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,468
And you Iove them very much.

812
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,697
They were her most
precious possession.

813
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,171
Now they're mine.
She can't take them
away from me.

814
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,572
BENSON: Your mother
didn't want you
to have the dolls?

815
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,042
She'd hit me
if I touched them.

816
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,477
She said that I'd break them.

817
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,641
"Boys are too rough.
Boys can't be trusted

818
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,343
"to handle fragile things."

819
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,551
But sometimes,
when she was really happy,

820
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,416
she'd Iet me dress them up.

821
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,787
I was very careful
not to break them.

822
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:03,229
I bet you take
really good care
of those dolls.

823
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,200
And I hear
that you fix them, too.

824
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,135
Yeah, I can fix anything.

825
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,731
I'm really good with my hands.

826
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,038
Man, that burn
must have hurt.

827
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,347
It was an accident.
BENSON:
Did your mother do that?

828
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,882
She Ioved me.

829
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,153
But Iittle boys are wicked.
Little boys need discipline.

830
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,021
But your mother
had no right to hurt you.

831
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,692
Little children deserve
to be Ioved.

832
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:35,425
Bad mothers shouldn't bring
Iittle children
into this world.

833
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,990
Susie Marshall
have a bad mother?

834
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,127
She was a crack whore.

835
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,072
Susie was sad all the time.

836
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,630
I Iet her play with my dolls.

837
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,005
Is that why
you took her, Terry?

838
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,101
So she could play with you?

839
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,873
In the Center,
she Ioved my dolls,

840
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,413
but then she didn't want
to play anymore.

841
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,778
She just wanted to go home.

842
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,249
And that must've
made you mad.

843
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,118
She broke one of my dolls.

844
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,679
I told her not to,
I told her that she'd be sorry

845
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,746
but she wouldn't Iisten.

846
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,157
That's when Susie got hurt?

847
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,126
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

848
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,688
Where did you keep Susie?

849
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,097
I can't tell you.

850
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,965
BENSON: Okay, Terry. Okay.

851
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,372
Well, then
Iet's talk about Nina.

852
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,500
No.

853
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,679
Terry, Nina has
a good mother.

854
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,305
No, she doesn't.

855
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,613
I saw her Ieave Nina
with that evil woman.

856
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,346
I saw that woman
yelling at Nina.

857
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,820
Terry, Nina's mother
came back.

858
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,815
She misses her
and wants to see her again.

859
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,917
I know what
you're trying to do.

860
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,154
You're trying to trick me.

861
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,164
Terry, where is Nina?
Where is Nina?

862
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,834
Where is she?

863
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,602
He's completely dissociated.
Just give him some time.

864
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,735
We don't have any time.
It's too Iate.

865
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,142
VIOLET: Detective Tutuola.

866
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,511
Violet, what are you
doing here?

867
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,780
Fin called me. He told me
that you have the man
who took Nina.

868
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,376
We have a suspect in custody.

869
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,751
Who won't talk.

870
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,619
I've got to see him.

871
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,785
Give us a minute.

872
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,359
I thought we were working
this case together

873
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,057
and you called Violet
without telling me?

874
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,826
You got another way
to get Jessup to talk?

875
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,562
Putting Violet and Jessup
together is a bad idea.

876
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,763
She was strong enough
to go to those NA meetings.

877
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,863
We prep her correctly,
I know she can handle it.

878
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,840
Back me up, Doc.

879
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,377
Jessup thinks he's saving Nina
from an abusive parent.

880
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,572
If you challenge his delusion,
he might break.

881
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,807
And if this doesn't work,

882
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,940
the guilt
will destroy Violet's Iife.

883
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,952
A dead child's gonna
destroy her even more.

884
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,853
Nina's gonna die
if we don't do something.

885
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,594
You sure you can do this?

886
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,865
Yes.

887
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:01,136
No matter what he says,
you have to be
stronger than him.

888
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,886
I'm ready.

889
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,449
Hello, Terry.

890
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,802
Do you know who I am?

891
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:34,942
Nina's mom?

892
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,970
That's right.

893
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,345
My name is Violet.

894
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,424
You ran away.

895
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,322
Nina was so sad.

896
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,258
I was sad, too.

897
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,265
I missed her very much.

898
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,261
But I Ieft to help Nina.

899
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,862
I was no good to her
the way I was.

900
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,280
That's why
Violet came back, Terry.

901
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,282
She came back for Nina.

902
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,582
It's too Iate.

903
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,022
FIN: No, it's not.

904
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,653
Nina needs her mother.
Make it right.

905
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,130
Nina's a good girl.

906
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,769
Yes, she is.

907
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,569
I'm a good mother.

908
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:44,508
Do you Iove her?
Yes.

909
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,244
With her gone,
it's Iike a knife in my heart.

910
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,477
I have another place.

911
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:37,763
Bastard's playing us.

912
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,704
Maybe not. Trap door. EIIiot.

913
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,075
Nina?

914
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,448
It's okay, baby.

915
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,024
It's okay, baby.
I'm a police officer.

916
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,030
(GROANING)

917
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,592
I got you. It's okay, baby.
You okay, baby? Look at me.

918
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:18,734
Look at me, baby, Iook. Okay.
I'II get you out of here.

919
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:20,939
I miss my Mommy.

920
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,273
I'II take you home.

921
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,278
She'II be all right.

922
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,846
Mommy?

923
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,864
Thank you.
