00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,131
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,832
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,066
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,008
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,569
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,376
These are their stories.

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,978
Cab driver went the way
I told him to,

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,315
we wouldn't have
got stuck in traffic.

9
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,083
We should've
taken the subway.

10
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,648
Body-slamming my way
onto the Number 9
with the great unwashed?

11
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,523
No thanks.
You're a snob.

12
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,823
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,863
We're so Iate,
I'm sure they started
dinner without us.

14
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,127
Come on, guys.

15
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,225
Take it easy, Josh,

16
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,328
I'm sure
they're in the back
by the dining room.

17
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,564
There. Open.

18
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,268
(SHIVERS)

19
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,234
Evan?
Sorry we're Iate.

20
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,604
Oh, my God.

21
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,681
(GROANS)

22
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,278
Yo, Lucates.
Take this couple
up to Homicide

23
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,948
and have Kroling
get their statements.
AII right?

24
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,752
Detective Dave
Duethorn,

25
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,259
I missed dinner
with my wife and kids,
this better be good.

26
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,692
Two naked women,
fluids everywhere,

27
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,195
both raped
and shot in the head.

28
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,731
That's our bread and butter.

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,699
So I guess the two
head-shot naked guys
with them

30
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,531
are nothing special, right?

31
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,865
DUETHORN: Well, what do
you think?

32
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,167
STABLER: Looks Iike
the party from hell.

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,400
DUETHORN: Dinner party,
to be exact.

34
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,033
With an orgy
for dessert.

35
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,634
Except they
never made it
to the appetizer.

36
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,542
Dining room
table's still set.

37
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,774
And check that out.

38
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,682
"Happy engagement.
Share wonderful
Iives together."

39
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,119
There's no signature.
Who's the unlucky
couple here?

40
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,316
Evan Briggs
and his fiancée,
Melissa Ziman.

41
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,552
Other two are
Dean McCarren
and Regina Valerio.

42
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,821
Couple who found them
made the IDs.

43
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,955
Evan and Melissa
invited some grad school
friends over to celebrate.

44
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,468
Not the type of evening
you'd expect to turn into
a sexual free-for-all.

45
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,968
I'm thinking
home invasion.

46
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,733
Doorbell rings,
victim opens door,

47
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,273
whacko busts in
and robs them.

48
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,434
You got four victims,
gotta be at Ieast two perps.

49
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,499
What'd they take?

50
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,602
AII the victims' jewelry.

51
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,840
Marks on the men's wrists
indicate they wore watches,

52
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,074
the women wore necklaces.

53
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,776
DUETHORN: Their wallets
and IDs are also gone,

54
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,684
along with Miss Ziman's
two-and-a-half karat
engagement ring.

55
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,153
Couple who found them
told me she got it Iast week.

56
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,316
Oh, and there's
something else, right, Doc?

57
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,883
Both men were beaten,
probably with the business end
of an automatic.

58
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,725
Something must have
set them off.

59
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,628
Pummel the men
and rape the women.

60
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,530
WARNER: Not just the women.

61
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,398
Excuse me?

62
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,537
The men were raped, too.

63
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,015
AII the violence
was pre-mortem,

64
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,488
the beatings and the rapes.

65
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,855
Anything
from the kits?

66
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,052
PIenty of fluids.

67
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,891
But when I
combed for hairs
things got strange.

68
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:17,987
Define strange.

69
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,258
Take a Iook.

70
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,734
Hairs Iook
the same to me.

71
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,599
WARNER: Both belong
to Evan Briggs.

72
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,901
I found the one
on the Ieft
on his fiancée.

73
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,736
Nothing unusual about that.

74
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,868
The other was in
the second male victim.

75
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,105
What the hell went on here?

76
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,374
Both men had blood
and fluids on them

77
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,712
that matched the blood types
of the other victims.

78
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,014
So the perps
forced the men

79
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,247
to rape the women
and then each other?

80
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,723
I'II need the DNA
to confirm it.
But that's how it Iooks.

81
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,193
The townhouse belongs
to Earl Briggs,

82
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,195
CEO of Happy Time Toys.

83
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,596
Evan is his son,
two of them Iived there alone.

84
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,997
Mom's deceased.

85
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,831
I checked Earl's
background and financials.

86
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,370
Tutuola.
Aside from being
worth 50 million,

87
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,100
nothing points to anyone
intentionally targeting
his home.

88
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,869
Well, what about
the victims?
Squeaky clean.

89
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,569
AII four come from
wealthy families,

90
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,544
had entry-Ievel
jobs in media.

91
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,671
FIN: Are you
ready for this?

92
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,044
We're Iooking
for one perp.

93
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,776
Lab found a bunch
of bloody footprints,

94
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,442
all made by the same
pair of shoes.

95
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,883
And I checked ViCAP.

96
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,853
Nobody's active
with a similar MO.

97
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,822
It's hard to believe
this sadistic son-of-a-bitch

98
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,619
just suddenly popped up
on the radar screen.

99
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,751
Guy Iike this was probably
in the system before.

100
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:25,195
Sexual assault, rape,
burglary, maybe a few
street holdups.

101
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,631
Pretty big step from there
to making four people
sodomize each other

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,065
and then whacking them.

103
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,159
What set him off, Doc?

104
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,603
Probably one of the victims
said or did something
to challenge his masculinity.

105
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,970
The sodomy
was to humiliate them.

106
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,941
Killing them was the
ultimate power trip.

107
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,739
Is this nut job
gonna hit again?

108
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,870
If he is a sadist,
he enjoyed it

109
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,778
and he'II want more.

110
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,282
Fin took your notification

111
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,716
and your boss agrees
we should be working
this case together.

112
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,651
So you're temporarily
reassigned here.

113
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,745
AII right.
That works for me.

114
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,221
But we got a Iittle
math problem.

115
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,690
MUNCH: Yeah?
Well, educate us.

116
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,455
Four deceased,
plus our two Iatecomers.

117
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,022
Look at the dining room table.
MUNCH: Seven place settings.

118
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,259
Well, maybe our
missing dinner guest

119
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,494
didn't Iike what
was on the menu.

120
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,865
We know who it is?

121
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,404
No, but Evan's father
probably does.

122
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,170
Everybody Ioved Evan.
I can't...

123
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,576
I can't think of a soul
who'd want to hurt him.

124
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,170
Anybody have a grudge
against you?

125
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,045
Oh, I doubt any
of my competitors

126
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,414
would resort to this
kind of mayhem.

127
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,009
As soon as you can,
we're gonna need a Iist

128
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,850
of everything
that was stolen.

129
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,982
There's some jewelry missing,
none of it's worth much.

130
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,152
The most valuable thing to me
was the picture.

131
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,387
What? A piece of art?

132
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,158
A framed photo
of Evan and me fishing.

133
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,896
It was hung in that
empty spot on the wall.

134
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,195
Why would he steal that?

135
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,466
Well, it's possible
it fell during the break-in,
and we have it in evidence.

136
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,938
We'II check.

137
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,335
Best we can tell,
Evan invited two couples

138
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,967
and another friend
for dinner.

139
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,137
But we can't account
for the single friend.

140
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,441
I think it was Buzzie.

141
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,742
FIN: You know Buzzie's
real name?

142
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,511
I'm sorry, Paul Dumont.

143
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,552
He just moved back
from Boston.

144
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,318
Evan and Buzzie
used to go to camp together.

145
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,448
You have any idea
how we can find him?

146
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,084
I just got him a job
over at NOHO Magazine.

147
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,991
He started two weeks ago.

148
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,794
Paul's not picking up.

149
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,695
You want to Ieave a message
on his voice mail?

150
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,734
No, we want to talk
to him in person.

151
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,735
You don't know
if he's in?

152
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,064
We have over 100 people
working here.

153
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,936
It's not my job
to keep track of them.

154
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,202
FIN: Is there anybody
that can help us?

155
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,709
The police are here
Iooking for Paul.

156
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,647
Sure, I'II tell them.

157
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,651
Editor is on his way out.

158
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,280
Appreciate it.

159
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,257
Are you the officers
Iooking for Paul Dumont?

160
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,418
FIN: Yes, we are.

161
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,052
I'm Ralph SIoan, the editor.

162
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,459
I just got a call
from Paul's parents.

163
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,555
Did something happen?

164
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,566
There was an
accident Iast night.

165
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,931
He's in the hospital.

166
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,526
FIN: They say which one?

167
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,300
Roosevelt. He's in bad shape.

168
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,471
EMS brought him in Iast night
with massive skull fractures.

169
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,011
DUETHORN: Was he awake
at any time?

170
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,513
Extent of his injuries,
I'm surprised he was alive.

171
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,243
We rushed him to the O.R.
to reduce the swelling
in his brain.

172
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,579
What are his chances?

173
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,485
Not good. A Iot of
damage and bleeding.

174
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,819
In my opinion,
too much for a fall.

175
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,188
Who said he fell?

176
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,318
EMS run report.
Said he was under
the influence,

177
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,759
found Iying on the street.

178
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,888
But it didn't scan for me.

179
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,933
FIN: I'm no doctor,
but that doesn't Iook good.

180
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,059
It's not.

181
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,261
Mr. Dumont
was hit in the head

182
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,304
in three places
with such force,

183
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,567
it caused
radiating fractures.

184
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,336
More consistent
with being whacked
on the head

185
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,536
with a blunt object
than with a fall.

186
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,771
You checked
his blood alcohol?

187
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,677
Yes, and it was zero.

188
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,340
He didn't have
a drop to drink.

189
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,644
MUNCH: Patrols from the 20
respond to a call for a drunk

190
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,019
in one of the stairwells
of the 79th Street
subway station.

191
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,682
They find Dumont,
all covered in blood,

192
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,989
smelling Iike he was
dragged through a wine vat.

193
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,121
Cops figure he tied one on,
fell down the stairs,
so they call the bus.

194
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,790
DNA put this guy
at the crime scene?

195
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,890
No. No, no.

196
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,798
Only blood found
belonged to the four
murder victims.

197
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,837
So he never went inside.

198
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,701
But his flowers did.

199
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,131
FIorist IDed Dumont
as the guy
who bought the flowers.

200
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,609
So we're thinking
the perp sees Dumont

201
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,975
going up the steps
of the Briggs place

202
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,377
with his flowers
and a bottle of wine.

203
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,007
Conks Dumont on the head,
throws him down the stairs.

204
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,846
Holds the flowers
Iike he's delivering them.

205
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,647
The door opens,
he goes and he does his thing.

206
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,744
Meanwhile, those whacks
on the head

207
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,845
Ieave Dumont disoriented

208
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,082
but not down
for the count.

209
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,182
So he somehow makes it
from the townhouse

210
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,817
all the way to
the subway station.

211
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,021
That's a Iong way to go
with a skull fracture.

212
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,961
Doctor said it's possible,
before he passed out.

213
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,226
And the wine?
Lab found stains on his coat.

214
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,860
Bottle must've broken
when he went down
and got all over him.

215
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,836
So Paul Dumont
is victim number five.

216
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,338
Crime of opportunity,
Captain.

217
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,464
Wrong place, wrong time.

218
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,009
Thanks. Just Iike
victims six and seven.

219
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,671
We got two more?
Riverside Park.

220
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,441
LAYTON: Parks Department guy
emptying the trash
found them.

221
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,642
Any ID?

222
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,877
In their wallets.

223
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,181
Russell and Darlene Weston,
both 51,

224
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,949
Iive a couple of blocks
up Riverside.

225
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,956
Both head-shot, naked.

226
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,326
Same as the townhouse.
Any signs of rape?

227
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,123
BIood on Mrs. Weston's
nether region.

228
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,390
Still waiting
for the M.E.

229
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,726
Your guys
find anything else?

230
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,390
Dug a spent slug
out of a tree.

231
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,832
Looks Iike a.380.

232
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,994
Rushed it to Ballistics,
waiting to see

233
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,798
if it matches
the other victims.

234
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,702
And check this out.

235
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,398
DUETHORN: Keys.

236
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,033
Belonging to one
of the victims,
I presume, right.

237
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,044
But found a couple
of yards away.

238
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,238
And Iook at the ring.

239
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,974
Oh, he Ieft
the keys to the house,

240
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,811
but he broke off
whatever was on the other end.

241
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,680
Maybe the keys
to the car, right.

242
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,276
Cash and credit cards
are gone.

243
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,820
LAYTON: So is their jewelry.

244
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,881
Got six murders in two days.
Dumont dies, that makes seven.

245
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,291
We got ourselves
a spree killer.

246
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,590
Add Paul Dumont
to the Ioss column.

247
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,295
Hospital called.
He died an hour ago.

248
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,529
Seven victims.

249
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,834
Except for Mr. Dumont,
they were all robbed,

250
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,897
sexually assaulted
and then shot.

251
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,273
Both scenes
are within 20 blocks.

252
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,209
This guy's killed
as many people in two days

253
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,042
as Son of Sam did
in four months.

254
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,843
Now you all have
your assignments,

255
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,884
Iet's get this guy.

256
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,613
Okay, how's it
going at the park?

257
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,053
CSU's still there,
Munch is supervising.

258
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,386
The slugs they found confirm
that the Westons were shot

259
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,585
with the same gun
used at the Briggs' townhouse.

260
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,718
Anything from the M.E.?

261
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,491
Rape kits on both victims
tested positive for fluids.

262
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,532
Doc Warner says pending DNA,

263
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,397
no stray hairs were found
other than the victims'.

264
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,662
So it's the same MO,

265
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,795
perp probably forced them
to have sex.

266
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,600
Well, Mrs. Weston
also had bruising

267
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,005
consistent with being
pistol-whipped.

268
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,065
Before she was shot.

269
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,872
Perp orders them to do it,
hubby says no.

270
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,436
Perp beats wifey,
threatens to kill her
unless he can get it up.

271
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,538
HUANG: That makes sense.

272
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,107
He probably beat the men
at the townhouse
for the same reason.

273
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,982
Okay, we got five kids
in their 20s

274
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,077
and a middle-aged couple.

275
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,781
This guy's making it up
as he goes along.

276
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,983
Or to him they all
have something in common.

277
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,185
Did we find out
what was hanging on
Mrs. Weston's key chain?

278
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,023
Family said it was
a picture of her grandson.

279
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,620
HUANG: And the photo missing
from the Briggs home?

280
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,289
Not in evidence,
so it was probably stolen.

281
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,357
Those are items that only
have value to their owners.

282
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,423
We thinking trophies?

283
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,026
Very specific trophies.

284
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,537
He's destroying
happy families,

285
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,266
maybe because
he's jealous.

286
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,864
I bet his own family
was miserable,

287
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,102
some kind of abuse.

288
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,370
And he's just gonna
keep taking it out

289
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,877
on these people
until we stop him.

290
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,380
EIIiot and OIivia
will run things from here.

291
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,383
Duethorn and Fin,
Iight a fire under CSU.

292
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,147
SIPER: We're combing the park
half a mile north and south,

293
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,916
from Riverside Drive
to the Hudson.

294
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,286
Any Iuck
besides the slug?

295
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,949
So far,
three distinct sets

296
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,586
of footwear impressions
at the murder site.

297
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,823
Two sets belonging
to the victims.

298
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,764
The third is a work boot,
presumably the perp's.

299
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,822
This is where
he Ieft the park.

300
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,232
Toes facing towards
the sidewalk.

301
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,997
Dental stone'II
pick up his tracks.

302
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,596
He ran from the bodies
to this point.

303
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,663
DUETHORN: You know he ran?

304
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,140
Yeah. Check out
the foot angle.

305
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,972
When you walk,
your feet point out slightly

306
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,637
at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock.

307
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,180
But they're slightly
straighter when you run,

308
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,510
Iike these prints.

309
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,277
GEORGIE: Captain!
SIPER: What's up, Georgie?

310
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,012
More impressions.

311
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,254
FIat sole, athletic shoe
and work boot.

312
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,191
Get Ivan over here
with the camera.

313
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,454
Our victims
and the perp.

314
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,497
Toes pointing to
the murder site.

315
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,826
Here's your entry point.

316
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,127
I guess Mr. and Mrs. Weston

317
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,168
weren't out for a midnight
stroll in the park.

318
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,204
They're on the sidewalk,
they Iook Iike easy marks,

319
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,069
our guy forces them
to go with him.

320
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,539
Yeah. When he's done,
he Ieaves the park

321
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,735
a couple yards south
of where he came in.

322
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,938
He's got a thousand
places to run,

323
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,244
he goes back to the only place
where he could be seen. Why?

324
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,716
No parking,
8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

325
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:01,979
Our perp's traveling by car,

326
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,282
it's perfectly Iegal
to park here.

327
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,222
He comes back for his ride
after he's done the deed.

328
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,317
Well, maybe somebody
in one of these buildings
parked behind him,

329
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,123
remembers the car.

330

(DOG BARKING)

331
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,498
The reason most
spree killers get caught

332
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,158
is 'cause they can't
help baiting the cops.

333
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,531
This animal's
giving us nothing.

334
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,298
Yeah. Neither are any
of these people.

335
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,105
How'd you get past
the doorman?

336
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,231
With this.

337
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,868
Detective Tutuola,
Detective Duethorn
and you are?

338
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:25,968
Renny Nix,

339
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,570
and you can't
barge in here Iike
you're Hawaii Five-O.

340
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,671
Take it easy, Mr. Nix...

341
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,614
When there's some guy
running around killing people.

342
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,878
What are you doing about that?

343
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,182
Seeing if anyone
in the building
saw anything.

344
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,814
Do you own a car?
No. Now get Iost.

345
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,252
You'd think
they'd be more helpful

346
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,319
instead of slamming
their doors in our faces.

347
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,261
Some people
don't Iike talking
to the cops.

348
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,993
Yeah, until they
need us, right?

349
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,898
How old are you?

350
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:50,993
Thirty.

351
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,061
How Iong on the job?
What, eight, nine years?

352
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,128
Five.

353
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,538
Where'd you work
before Homicide?

354
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,772
Patrolling the 48,
before I got my gold shield.

355
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,810
Only way that happens
is you collared
Osama Bin Laden

356
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,315
and I didn't get it,

357
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,510
or you got a real good
rabbi on this job.

358
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,053
I grew up next door
to the First Deputy
Commissioner.

359
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,986
So you parachuted
into Homicide.

360
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,183
You know what,
start in on how
I didn't earn it

361
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,557
and I'II parachute right back.
I don't need a Iecture.

362
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,096
You do the job,
you got no problems with me.

363
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,756
BRENDA: Excuse me, Officers?

364
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,856
Can we help you?

365
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,701
I'm sorry, my husband,
Renny Nix, was horribly
rude to you inside.

366
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,670
He said we shouldn't
get involved.

367
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,764
Did you see
something, Mrs. Nix?
Yes.

368
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,035
Last night, around midnight

369
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,907
I was closing the curtains
on my Iiving room window.

370
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,139
I saw a man and a woman
standing here

371
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,546
next to a car that was
parked right there.

372
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,244
Then another man
got out of
the driver's seat,

373
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,412
and walked behind them
into the park.

374
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,046
Could you see
what he Iooked Iike?

375
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,455
His dark winter coat,
wool cap.

376
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,514
I didn't see his face,

377
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,026
he walked around
the front of the car.

378
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,755
FIN: How Iong before
he came back?

379
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,297
I don't know.
I went to sleep.

380
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,956
Do you remember
anything about the car?

381
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,001
It was gold,

382
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,003
Iast two numbers
of the Iicense plate
were 3-5,

383
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,766
my daughter's birthday,
March 5th.

384
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,207
But I wouldn't know
a Lexus from a Lincoln.

385
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,140
Detective Shubel
from our Accident
Investigation Unit's

386
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,739
gonna take you through
his computer program.

387
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,545
Now we already know
the car's gold.

388
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,949
Were there two doors or four?

389
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,453
Four.

390
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,116
Did it have a trunk,
a hatchback, or a flat bed?

391
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,488
A trunk, definitely.

392
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,151
So it's a sedan.

393
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,295
Can you describe
the rear Iights?

394
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,923
Kind of oval?

395
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,129
Okay. Like this?

396
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,602
No. The Iights wrapped
around the side.

397
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,435
And the Iicense plate
was on the trunk.

398
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,302
Okay. How's this?

399
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,435
That's it!

400
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,035
Ford Contour.

401
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,576
Here we go. '95 Ford Contour.
Address Central Park West.

Oh, wait. There's gotta be
hundreds of them.

403
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,285
How do you know
that's the one?

404
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,449
This one came up as stolen.

405
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,590

406

have you?

Sorry, we're just
doing a follow-up.

419

Could you tell us
what happened?

420
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,490
Yeah. Sure.

421
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:34,054
About three days ago,
I go out to my plumbing
supply place in Jersey,

422
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,794
and I go to where
the car is parked,

423
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,926
it's not there anymore.

424

It's all in the report.

425
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,901
Are you sure you just didn't
Ieave it somewhere else?

426
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,134
I mean, me,
I'm always forgetting
what street I put the car on.

427
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,698
No. No. I searched
this neighborhood,

428
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,642
I'm telling you,
I even called both my boys.

429
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,077
I thought maybe

430
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,944
one of them took it
without telling me, you know?

431
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,107
You gonna get it back for me?

432
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,549
Well, it was a Ford,
so it probably wasn't
boosted for parts.

for the cabinet, you know.

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,384
So whoever boosted this,

468
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,723
did it the easy way,
with a key.

469
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,354
Or the owner dumps it
with the key in it.

470
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,127
Somebody else steals it,
owner collects the insurance.

471
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,225
Where are the victims?

472
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,932
CRAGEN: Adam Darling
and Craig Fischetti,
both 22.

473
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,201
Found both guys' wallets,
no cash inside.

474
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,299
What about jewelry?

475
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,570
WARNER: They both
wore wristwatches,

476
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,305
they have corresponding
marks on their wrists.

477
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,505
CRAGEN: How Iong
they been dead?

478
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,071
Six to eight hours.
They were murdered Iast night.

479
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,584
They got their clothes on.
Any signs of sexual activity?

480
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,018
Haven't checked yet.
But Mr. Darling's fly is open.

481
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,522
Yeah. Could have stopped here
to take a Ieak, you know?

482
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,057
This place is a
Iover's Iane at night.

483
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,592
These two might have been
in the middle of something

484
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,786
when the perp found them.

485
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,089
Or maybe the perp
didn't have enough time

486
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,323
to make them do
what he wanted.

487
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,025
Well, assuming
these two walked in,

488
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,499
why'd the perp
dump his ride?

489
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,002
My guess, he got spooked.
He could've Ieft on foot.

490
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,629
Or in the victim's car.

491
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,935
Registration in
Adam Darling's wallet.

492
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,136
Silver Acura,
address Tenafly, New Jersey.

493
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,807
New York Police?

494
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,111
We're here about
the silver Acura SUV.

495
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,679
My son Adam
borrowed it Iast night

496
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,085
and we haven't
heard from him.

497
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,287
Are he and Craig
and the girls okay?

498
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,452
What girls?

499
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,928
DUETHORN: Names are
CIaudia Smullen
and Diane Combs,

500
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,557
both 21,
roommates at Barnard.

501
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,067
Double-dating with our
two male victims.

502
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,104
We grid-searched the park,
checked their apartment,

503
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,435
and called their parents.
These girls are in the wind.

504
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,135
Let's get alerts out
on all their credit cards
and bank accounts

505
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,734
in case somebody's using them.

506
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,836
How are we doing
on those phone tips, John?

507
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,278
Do you remember
that white van
everybody saw

508
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,679
during the DC
sniper shootings?

509
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,512
Well, our man is a plumber,

510
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,179
garbage man, doorman,
husband.

511
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,243
The city's out of control.

512
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,313
Ballistics says
it's the same gun.

513
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,721
Nine dead, two missing.

514
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,623
This guy's killed every one
of his victims so far,

515
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,286
why snatch these two women?

516
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,024
They're Iiving trophies
and I think he's stashing
them somewhere.

517
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,292
So what's changed?

518
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,390
HUANG: His confidence.

519
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,765
He used the victims
as surrogates
to rape each other.

520
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,929
Maybe he's ready to rape
the women himself now.

521
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,905
This guy's MO's
all over the map.

522
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,464
But we still do have
some constants.

523
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,531
The gun, for one thing.

524
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,271
His comfort zone,
the Upper West Side.

525
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,778
He Iikes
controlled environments,

526
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,007
the townhouses,
secluded areas of parks.

527
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,481
And he targets couples.

528
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,518
A woman or a man
walking alone

529
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,984
Iate at night,
they're vigilant.

530
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,247
But two people walking together,

531
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,686
they don't always
perceive the danger.

532
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,054
Guy's an animal hunting
the slowest prey in the herd.

533
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,753
Or a Ioner who has trouble
making social connections.

534
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,592
So people in
successful relationships
trigger his rage.

535
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,222
Because they have
what he never will.

536
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,130
And maybe kidnapping
these two women

537
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,668
is his way
to fulfill his fantasy.

538
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,034
BENSON: Assuming that
they're not already dead.

539
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,367
How much time do we have?

540
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,701
When he's done
or when one of these women

541
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,401
pisses him off,
he's gonna kill them.

542
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,602
STABLER: Maybe we
just caught a break.

543
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,339
Lab got something
out of the Contour.

544
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,038
No blood,
no prints matching anyone
in the system,

545
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,085
no fibers connecting
any of the victims
to the Contour.

546
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,551
But we did
find footprints

547
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,713
consistent with all
of the crime scenes.

548
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,518
So we can estimate his height.

549
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,956
EIeven-and-a-half
inch impressions

550
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,186
means the perp's shoe size

551
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,285
is between eight
and nine-and-a-half.

552
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,388
So our guy is
between 5'5" and 5'10".

553
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,262
And, he's wearing these.

554
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,030
OutdoorWear Explorers.

555
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:08,300
Very expensive.
But great treads
for trace evidence.

556
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,673
Which we found in the car
and in his boot impressions.

557
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,976
Wood?
Pine, oak and cherry.

558
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,449
The tube next to it
has fiberglass insulation.

559
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,611
Sounds Iike we're
after someone who works
in construction.

560
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,281
That's what I thought
until I found the rest.

561
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,618
DUETHORN: What is this?
Grass seed?

562
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,923
Two different blends.

563
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,863
Rye and Kentucky bluegrass.
Suburban boy?

564
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,326
Yonkers,
but even my old man

565
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,266
never made me seed
the Iawn in the
middle of winter.

566
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,237
Well, I doubt it came
from the park.

567
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,036
There were also
traces of diazinon,
a common pesticide,

568
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,101
ammonium nitrate and Iime,
both used for fertilizer,

569
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,171
and some metal shavings,
bronze and brass.

570
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,409
From what?

571
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,917
I'd say a
key-cutting machine.

572
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:58,646
So he had key shavings, wood,
insulation and bug killer.

573
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,419
AII the stuff
a building super uses.

574
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,983
Except for the grass seed
and the fertilizer.

575
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,688
We're Iooking for someone
who works around

576
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,129
these materials every day.

577
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,461
DUETHORN: The only place
you can find all that stuff

578
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,798
is in a home
improvement store.

579
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,394
AII right,
send a flatbed and a team

580
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,669
and make sure
nobody touches it
before it gets here.

581
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,902
What's up, Captain?

582
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,035
Your silver SUV
just turned up.

583
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,080
With somebody sleeping inside.

584
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,980
Anti-Crime found the SUV
parked on 49th
between 8th and 9th.

585
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,043
I managed to get
a description from a drunk

586
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,486
who was sitting in
the back seat of the car.

587
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,523
Young, average height,
dark hair, blue eyes.

588
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,058
Great. So he Iooks Iike
a million other people.

589
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,754
Yeah, but most of them
don't work in a home
improvement store.

590
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,661
And we're gonna have to
canvass every single one
of them that sell Iumber.

591
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,892
That's the only
solid Iead we have.

592
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,727
He's about 5'9",
dark hair, blue eyes.

593
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,936
We have several employees
who fit that description.

594
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,910
Hari Singh,
Andy Regal,

595
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,970
Butch Lanahan,
Billy Baker...

596
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,208
Billy Baker?
Yeah.

597
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,307
Works 4:00 to 11:00
in the Iumber department.

598
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,681
He Iives over
on Central Park West?

599
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,912
Yeah.

600
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,956
Seems funny someone
with that address
would work here.

601
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,991
I can't imagine him
being in any kind of trouble.

602
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,687
Yeah. Why's that?
He's a boss's dream.

603
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,228
Does whatever
you tell him to,
never complains.

604
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,991
Worked here three years,
only Iate once.

605
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,896
FIN: When?
Other day.

606
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,058
Said his car was stolen.

607
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,861
The Contour was never boosted.
Billy just took it.

608
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,099
Yeah, and Billy knows
we're asking
questions about it,

609
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,665
he figures it's too hot,
dumps it in Central Park.

610
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,802
CRAGEN: Explains why
the steering column
was clean.

611
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,506
That quiet Iittle guy
was a time bomb
waiting to explode?

612
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,980
Billy's the super's kid.

613
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,346
He grew up surrounded
by rich people

614
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,975
who probably treated
him Iike dirt.

615
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,680
And every one of our victims
is wealthy or appeared to be.

616
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:37,881
And now he's getting
back at them.

617
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,719
We picking him up,
Captain?

618
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,019
Doc?

619
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,458
It's an all-power game.

620
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,017
Arrest him now,
he may never tell us

621
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,859
where these missing women are.

622
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,865
CRAGEN: Then we sit on him
to make sure
he doesn't kill again

623
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,594
and hope he Ieads us
to the victims.

624
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,034
Three teams,
three shifts, 24/7.

625
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,799
CSU is done with the Contour,

626
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,169
Iet's get it back
to the Bakers.

627
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,571
Unless he stole another car,

628
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,508
Billy's gonna need
some transportation.

629
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,973
FIN: How you read that trash?

630
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,175
I got an inquiring mind.

631
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,718
You get off on that
psych stuff, don't you?

632
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,550
Average murder's
one drug dealer
shooting another,

633
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,886
a bar fight
or a domestic gone bad.

634
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,516
Once you figure out the who,

635
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,494
working Homicide's all about
where the perps are
and finding them.

636
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,120
So?

637
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,665
Sex crime is about the why.

638
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,863
This city's
a three-ring circus
and SVU's the freak show.

639
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,840
And you wanna be
the ringmaster.

640
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,967
I wanna know
what makes them freaks.

641
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,243
Here it comes.

642
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,511
FIN: It's the Contour.

643
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,678
Okay, kiddies,
car's on the move.

644
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,812
Billy's driving.

645
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,717
South on Columbus.
Our boy's behind the wheel.

646
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,188
Comes all the way
down here to get cash?

647
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,758
He could have done that
on Columbus Avenue.

648
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,071
DUETHORN: Look at that.

649
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,300
Do you know anyone
that needs a cheat sheet

650
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,569
to remember a PIN number?

651
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,804
Only when it
ain't their card.

652
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,140
SVU detail to base,

653
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,841
subject appears to be
using a stolen ATM card.

654
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,117
If he's got the PIN number,
they could still be alive.

655
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,882
CRAGEN: Take him.
FIN: 10-4.

656
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,917
We're taking him.
Nice and easy,
may have a gun.

657
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,335
Police officers, stop!

658
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,208
BILLY: No, no.
Get off of me, please.

659
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,746
PIease!

660
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,985
That what you did,
Billy? Huh?
FIN: Dave!

661
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,988
Huh? Is that what you did?
You made them
plead for their Iives?

662
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,455
Before you blew
their heads off?
Come on. Ease off.

663
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,287
Is that what you did? Huh?
Dave! Easy! Easy!

664
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,826
Crying Iike a Iittle girl.
Where are they?

665
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,054
Don't you move.
Where are they?

666
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,356
Where are the girls?
Dave!

667
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,227
Where are the girls?
Dave!

668
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,663
(BILLY GRUNTS)

669
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,138
The ATM card will be enough
to get a warrant
to search his crib.

670
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,904
CRAGEN: Anything?
If it's here it's well-hidden.

671
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,313
You guys are making
a big mistake.

672
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,941
Billy wouldn't do
something Iike this.

673
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,679
Our evidence says he did.

674
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,380
Billy have access
to anywhere else
in the building?

675
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,219
Yes. Everywhere.
I keep all the master keys
in my office.

676
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,452
Billy's been hanging out
in the basement a Iot Iately.

677
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,926
What's down there?

678
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,623
Boiler room, Iaundry,
owner's storage Iockers.

679
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,028
You got keys
to those, too?

680
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,430
AL: Yes, sir. I do.

681
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,900
Don't you need, Iike,
a warrant or something?

682
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,494
Not if we have
the owner's consent.

683
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,172
Over here.
What have you got?

684
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,780
CRAGEN: Evan
and Earl Briggs.

685
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,174
MUNCH: Mrs. Weston's
grandson from
her key chain.

686
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,588
Melissa Ziman's
engagement ring.

687
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,617
And one pair of
OutdoorWear work boots.

688
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,797
DUETHORN: Game's up, Billy.
We got you cold.

689
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,835
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Save it, Billy.

690
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,233
I don't wanna hear
how you didn't do it,

691
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,397
it wasn't you,
you were abused
as a child.

692
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,599
We have the boots.
Look at them.

693
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,802
They match prints
at all the crime scenes

694
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,003
and in your father's car.

695
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,739
What, you can't stand
the sight of them, Billy?

696
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,611
Look at them, Billy.
They're your boots.
Look at them.

697
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,742
(SOBBING)
Why are you picking on me?

698
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,583
I told you I didn't do it.

699
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,087
Then explain this stuff!
You know what this is?

700
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,420
This is your one-way ticket
to a Iethal injection.

701
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,152
But you got
a chance here, Billy.

702
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,625
What chance?

703
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,890
Tell us where these women are.

704
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,159
The DA'II spare you
the death penalty.

705
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,996
They die and it's all
over for you.

706
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,798
The story doesn't have to
end that way though.

707
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,602
Look at me.

708
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,803
Don't blow this,
it's your only shot.

709
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,042
I wanna talk to my brother.

710
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,146
DUETHORN: You gotta show us
some good faith here first.

711
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,920
Where are the women?

712
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,155
I'II tell you
whatever you want.

713
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,198
Just Iet me talk
to Charlie first.

714
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,125
Two hours,
it's the first time
he's cracked.

715
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,727
Brother goes in
and tells Billy to Iawyer up,
we're screwed.

716
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,601
Doesn't matter,
the case is already
bulletproof

717
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,765
without Billy's confession.

718
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,308
Our priority is
finding those women.

719
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,775
They've been missing
for 24 hours.

720
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,812
We gotta
take the risk.

721
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:32,339
Charlie goes for it,
I want both of you and Huang
Iistening to every word.

722
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,346
Maybe I should call a Iawyer?

723
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,980
No Iawyer in the world's
gonna be able
to help him out of this.

724
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,250
His only chance
to stay alive

725
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,916
is to tell us where
those women are.

726
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,927
He's right, Dad.
We have to save his Iife.

727
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,088
Look, you sure
you know what you're doing?

728
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,758
Yeah.
Let me talk to him.

729
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,666
Billy...

730
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,138
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

731
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,803
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

732
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,809
I screwed up.

733
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,044
Are you mad at me?

734
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,380
No, you're my brother.

735
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:14,154
But you and me,
we gotta work this out.

736
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,458
How?

737
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,861
The cops want you to show them
where these women are.

738
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,434
No, I won't do it.

739
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,980
You have to do
the right thing here, Billy.

740
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,481
You have to be strong.

741
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,083
You have to be a man.

742
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,147
I am.

743
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,187
Can't you see that?

744
00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:00,334
No matter what happens
I'm always here for you.

745
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,674
You understand?

746
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,507
I Iove you, Charlie.

747
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,846
I love you,
too, Billy.

748
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,776
He's not gonna
tell us a damn thing.

749
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,445
Lied so he could
see his brother.
Anything, Doc?

750
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,613
Nothing, except Billy never
asked for his father.

751
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,782
Well, Charlie's sober.
Dad isn't.

752
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,318
Sorry, Detectives.

753
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,624
Thanks for trying.
Your father's outside.

754
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,797
He didn't give up
anything, Captain.

755
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,929
We're heading back in.

756
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,235
Forget it.
We got two more bodies.

757
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,365
Greenwich Village.

758
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,770
That's way out
of his comfort zone.

759
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,308
What's going on?

760
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,278
Iris and Daniel Braverman.
Mid-20s. Found by their maid.

761
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,550
Iris was shot once,
execution-style.

762
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,182
Husband's another story.

763
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,652
(GROANS)

764
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,989
Man, this guy's face
is gone.

765
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,325
Found some stippling
on what skin was Ieft.

766
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,194
Shooter put the gun
right between his eyes.

767
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,893
As if he wanted him
to see it coming.

768
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,298
Was Mrs. Braverman raped?

769
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,166
Yes. But no fluids
on the husband.

770
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,068
Which means our guy
did the deed himself.

771
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,197
How Iong they dead?

772
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,435
They're not in rigor yet.
Less than six hours.

773
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,703
DUETHORN: Rules out Billy.

774
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,369
He's been in custody
all night.

775
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,935
Okay. The perp empties
a whole clip

776
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,709
into this guy's face
point-blank

777
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,443
then rapes
the wife, himself.

778
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,882
It's way off the MO.

779
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,078
It could be a copycat.

780
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,121
Or Billy had a partner.

781
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,282
Whoever it is,
this is personal.

782
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,688
We need to check
these victims'
backgrounds

783
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,420
as quickly as possible.

784
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,689
And get the ballistics.

785
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,027
The Bravermans
have been in the same
address for two years.

786
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,190
Before that, college.

787
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,257
Before that, Daniel
Iived with his parents,

788
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,962
same address as Billy Baker.

789
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,026
How Iong?

790
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,662
Their whole Iife.
Grew up there.

791
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,468
With Billy
and his brother.

792
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,305
I got it! I got it.
Guess what?

793
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,811
It's the same gun.
It's the same gun.

794
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,041
But guess what.
CRAGEN: What?

795
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,015
It's two perps.
How do we know that?

796
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,951
The footprints. AII right.
This one we found
in Riverside Park, right?

797
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,248
This one we found
in Central Park

798
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,346
where the women
were snatched.

799
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,415
Two right foot prints,
same boot, same size.

800
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,357
This one,
this guy walks normally.

801
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,022
And then this one,
with the smudge,
we found four of them,

802
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,190
one right in front
of the next.

803
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,927
This is our second perp
and this guy,

804
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,096
he walks with a Iimp.

805
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,365
Just Iike Charlie.

806
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,704
HUANG: That song-and-dance
in interrogation
was all an act.

807
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,834
Charlie was telling Billy
to keep his mouth shut.

808
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,209
Charlie's the dominant one.
He's the one
calling the shots.

809
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,043
We gotta pick him up.
Go easy.

810
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,878
He knows we're onto him,
he's Iiable to kill the women

811
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,646
if he hasn't already.

812
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,415
Charlie's gone.
Where?

813
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,183
I don't know.
He at work?

814
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,281
No.

815
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,450
They called here
Iooking for him.

816
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,049
But they said
he never showed up.

817
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,425
When's the Iast time
you seen him?

818
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,794
Was when we Ieft
the police station.

819
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,662
Got any idea
where he may have gone?

820
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,634
Why, you think
he'd tell me?

821
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:48,160
Let me guess,
he's in trouble now,
too, huh?

822
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,399
DUETHORN: You don't even
sound surprised.

823
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,568
No. Because if Billy did
what you think Billy did,

824
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,111
Charlie must've had
something to do with it.

825
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,202
Why do you say that?

826
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,248
Because Billy
can't do anything

827
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,475
without somebody
telling him to.

828
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,813
This kid has never
made a decision

829
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,409
in his whole Iife
on his own, you know?

830
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,045
Lets the whole world
push him around.

831
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,487
Listen!
Hey, hey, hey.

832
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,547
We got two women missing
and I don't have
a Iot of time!

833
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,150
Okay. Okay. Just don't hit me.

834
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,290
Just... Just don't hit.

835
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,093
AII right. AII right.
We got it.

836
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,600
Does anyone
besides his brother
know where Charlie is?

837
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,659
Yeah. Yeah. His girlfriend.

838
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,399
He and that slut
work together.

839
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,576
MARIE: I have no idea
where Charlie is.

840
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,114
Why are you asking me?

841
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,548
Well, because
you're his girlfriend.

842
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,815
I was his girlfriend.
I dumped him six months ago.

843
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,382
He's crazy.
He and that brother of his.

844
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,189
You know Billy?

845
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,093
Yeah. Too well.

846
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,755
And that was kind of
the problem.

847
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,998
You had sex
with your boyfriend's brother?

848
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,603
Billy was a Iittle fast,
but cute.

849
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,768
I didn't really mind
when Charlie told me
to break him in.

850
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,835
And you did everything
Charlie told you to do?

851
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:05,474
I thought I Ioved him.
Until the Iast time.

852
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,841
What happened?

853
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,282
Charlie climbed into bed
with me and Billy.

854
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,381
You had a threesome?

855
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,482
Yeah.

856
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,959
Until it became a twosome.
And I wasn't one of the two.

857
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,830
Charlie and Billy?

858
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,928
Yeah.

859
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:33,435
Billy didn't really want to,
but Charlie made him.

860
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,644
Billy was crying so Ioud

861
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:39,182
that their daddy came back
and caught us.

862
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,785
Charlie threatened to kill me,

863
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,017
Billy and their father
if we ever told anybody.

864
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,294
What'd those officers
bring me here for, huh?

865
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,498
I told you
I don't know anything.

866
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,040
Mr. Baker, how did you
hurt yourself?

867
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,735
I'm a building super.
It happens.

868
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,970
FIN: You're pretty
accident-prone.

869
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,069
I had a bad week.

870
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,272
Yeah. Is that why
you been drinking?

871
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,212
So I take a pop
every now and then, so what?

872
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,773
FIN: You reek of booze.
You're drunk!
Hey, hey! Come on!

873
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,785
I said just,
just don't hit me, okay?

874
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,720
Just don't, don't hit me.

875
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,014
I'm not trying to hurt you.
Come on.

876
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,253
I'm trying to help you.
Get up.

877
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,163
HUANG: Who's been
beating you, AI?

878
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,466
Nobody.

879
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,932
Was it Charlie?
No.

880
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,839
But you caught Charlie
having sex with Billy,
didn't you?

881
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,211
AI?

882
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,318
Yeah. He was raping Billy.

883
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,428
And you tried
to stop him.

884
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,192
I told him to Ieave him alone.

885
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,698
He just Iaughed at me.

886
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,236
He said I was a drunken Ioser.

887
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,704
He said I couldn't
keep a woman.

888
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,004
He told me he was gonna do
whatever he wanted to do.

889
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,236
So I tried to
pull him off Billy,

890
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,710
he just pushed me away.

891
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,076
AII right and then
what happened?

892
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,206
Then I called him a faggot.

893
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,948
So he hit me. Boy.

894
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,579
My kid hit me,
again, and again, and again.

895
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,584
Now he hits me every day.

896
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,126
Did Billy beat you, too?

897
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,493
No.

898
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,362
Never. Billy would never
do that. He's a sweet kid.

899
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,460
Wouldn't hurt a fly
unless Charlie told him to.

900
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:43,064
Billy's a good, good kid.

901
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,631
Billy didn't put
that stuff in that Iocker

902
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,609
from those poor people.
Charlie did it.

903
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,043
Charlie got the key
and Charlie stole

904
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,581
every time he could
from all those residents.

905
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,844
Said I was gonna Iose my job
if I told anybody.

906
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,483
Did you help Charlie
hide those women?

907
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,786
No. I swear I didn't.

908
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:01,950
HUANG: AI?

909
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,424
We need to find them.

910
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,264
Yeah. I know.

911
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,232
FIN: Are you hiding Charlie?

912
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,470
Boy, you guys
don't understand.

913
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,701
He's gonna kill me.

914
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,003
He's not gonna ever be able
to hurt you again.

915
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,447
If you don't tell us
where he is
and those women die,

916
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,779
that's on you.

917
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,554
He's in an apartment
in my building.

918
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,890
One of the residents
is on vacation.

You told them where I was!
You bastard! I'II kill you!

924
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,858
I should have killed you
for what you did to Billy.

would all be dead.

931
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,911
Then us, then your dad,
then you'd do yourself?

932
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,915
Not today, Charlie.

933
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,382
Come on.

934
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,679
You're never gonna
find those bitches.

935
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,154
They're gonna die

936
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,020
and you're never
gonna find them.

937
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,262
Where are they?

938
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,301
How many times
you gonna ask me
the same stupid question?

939
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,428
As many times as it takes!
Where are they?

940
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,132
You're wasting your breath
because I'm not gonna
tell you a damn thing.

941
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,675
Give it up, Charlie!
Your father
told us everything!

942
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,438
My father doesn't
know dick.

943
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,945
Yeah? He saw you
rape your brother.

944
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,778
He doesn't know what he saw.
He's a drunken Ioser.

945
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,908
That why you beat him?

946
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,383
Because he caught you
screwing your brother

947
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,919
and he called you a fag?

948
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,114
Your ex-girlfriend, Marie,
said that right foot of yours

949
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,816
ain't the only thing
that's Iimp.

950
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,416
But you can make it happen
with your own brother,
ain't that right, Charlie?

951
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,518
Yeah. That why
you raped him?

952
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:18,527
That's why
you got that gun

953
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,326
to show everybody
you're a man.

954
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,694
You think you guys
are better than me?

955
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:27,897
You think you're Iike
all those rich people?

956
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,769
You think you can push me
around Iike they did?

957
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,330
Is that what this
is all about?

958
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,400
You're damn right it is!

959
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,139
And I showed them!
Yeah.

960
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,805
You showed them.

961
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,709
Now tell us where they are!

962
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,716
If you're so smart,
go find them yourself.

963
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,025
Look at that...
Look at that door,
pretty boy.

964
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,758
Look at that door.

965
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,905
You think this
is gonna work, huh?

966
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,812
Billy, you have to
tell them.

967
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,752
No. Take me
back to jail.

968
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,946
I tried, Son.

969
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,683
I did. I tried to
protect you from him.

970
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,622
So I could grow up
to be Iike you?

971
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,225
Charlie is twice the man
you'II ever be.

972
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,096
FIN: Charlie set
you up, Billy.

973
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,007
What are you
talking about?

974
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,338
Know all that
stuff you stole

975
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,469
from the people
you murdered,

976
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,705
and the boots you wore,

977
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,543
you know where
we found them?

978
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,209
In a storage Iocker
in your building.

979
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,723
Don't tell them
anything, Billy.

980
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:01,356
That's not where
we hid those things, Charlie.

981
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,291
Why'd you put them there?

982
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,393
Because he was gonna make you
take the rap all by yourself.

983
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,960
No, I wasn't.

984
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,369
It's not true, Billy.

985
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,135
It is true.
He stole the keys.

986
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,142
He betrayed you, Billy.

987
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,112
He would never do that.

988
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,649
AL: He's no good.

989
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,686
I may not be much,
but I never Iied to you, Son.

990
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,654
I never sold you out.
He sold you out.

991
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,551
BILLY: No.

992
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,256
Only your boots
were there, Billy.
Not Charlie's.

993
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,693
Why did you do that?

994
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,201
Be a man, Billy.

995
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,601
Don't tell them
where those bitches are!

996
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,865
Why didn't you protect me?

997
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,997
Shut up!

998
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,940
You said it was us
against everyone else!

999
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,107
And you Iied to me.
You're a Iiar!
You Iittle wimp!

1000
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:53,275
I'II rip you apart
if you tell them anything!

1001
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,410
Charlie made me
kill those people!

1002
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,546
Shut the hell up!

1003
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,351
But he shot those
women's boyfriends!
Shut up!

1004
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,857
Where are they, Billy?
Where are the women?

1005
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,451
CHARLIE: No!
Don't tell them anything!

1006
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,654
They're on the roof!

1007
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,196
You stupid son of a bitch.

1008
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,095
What roof? What roof?
Shut up!

1009
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,930
Of our building.
In the old water tower.

1010
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,076
(PEOPLE CHATTERING ON RADIO)

1011
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,808
How are they?

1012
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,281
PARAMEDIC:
They'II be all right.

1013
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,181
They're frostbitten.
Got her.

1014
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,550
They wouldn't have
Iasted another night.

1015
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,986
Any signs
of sexual assault?

1016
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,785
Not that
we can see.

1017
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,952
Won't be sure
until we get them
to the hospital.

1018
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,063
You're gonna be okay.

1019
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,267
What now?

1020
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,071
Go to the hospital,
take their statements,
get some sleep.
