a sample so you can frame
me with my own cells.

154
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,969
Why would we do that?

155
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:01,173
I don't know.
Why would you stick a plunger
up Abner Louima's ass?

156
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,877
If you want anything from me,
come back with a warrant.

157
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,146
I believe
that's check and mate.

158
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,121
Sure is, smartass.

159
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,660
STABLER: Couldn't get a DNA
sample from our suspect,
but I think we got prints.

160
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,126
Index finger
and thumb.

161
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,224
I'II see if I can Iift
a print off the body.

162
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,292
Meanwhile, I've got
Iots to work with.

163
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,167
There's evidence
of vaginal trauma,

164
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,935
I've got the perp's fluids,
and I got skin cells,

165
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,566
from underneath
her acrylic nails.

166
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,133
Great for trapping evidence.

167
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,974
Could explain
the Band-Aid
on Donovan's neck.

168
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,741
Vanessa clawed
the son of a bitch.

169
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,180
She wasn't
the only one.

170
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,445
The blood on the cat's fur
was Vanessa's,

171
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,249
but the blood on its claws,
was a match to the perp.

172
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,016
We gotta get
Donovan's DNA.

173
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,024
I'II get the prints off
the chess piece and send them

174
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,219
over to Ballistics
to compare with the gun.

175
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,655
I dusted the gun.
The wooden grip is too
textured to raise prints,

176
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,700
and only your victim's
are on the barrel.

177
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,234
Like Vanessa
tried to grab it.

178
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,998
AIso found a greasy
substance on the weapon.

179
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,095
Gun cleaning fluid?

180
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,106
No, I'd recognize
that in my sleep.

181
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,641
I'II run some
tests on it.

182
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,801
So that's it?

183
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,538
Would I waste your time?

184
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,273
I've got the gun owner.

185
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,611
You mean we have a Iegal,
registered piece?

186
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,744
Mmm-hmm. Carry permit comes
back to Marvin KIigman,
address on Park Avenue.

187
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,247
Sure, Marvin had a gun.

188
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:22,055
My Iate husband,
may he rest in peace,
was in the diamond trade.

189
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,926
Dangerous business.

190
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,759
MUNCH: Where's the gun now,
Mrs. KIigman?

191
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,991
In my Iock box.

192
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,328
May we see it?

193
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,063
Of course.

194
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,298
Does anyone else
have access to the gun?

195
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,308
Only my son.
He Iives in the dorms.
At Hudson University.

196
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,284
It's gone.

197
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,321
I didn't take
my father's gun.

198
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,551
How did it get used
to kill your classmate?

199
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,890
I don't know anything
about Vanessa's murder.

200
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,793
But you do know her.
Yeah.

201
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,262
Yeah? You sleeping with her?

202
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,424
Yeah, I wish.

203
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,989
BENSON: Where were you
Iast night?

204
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,697
At an all-night cram session
with my study group.
Go check.

205
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,969
Oh, we will, but right now
you're the one who's Iooking
good for this murder.

206
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,470
Okay.

207
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,540
I got a Iittle over-extended
on the Super Bowl.

208
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,015
I was gonna sell the gun,
but someone stole it.

209
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,608
You know Donovan AIvarez?

210
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,777
Yeah, sure,
he Iives down my hall.

211
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,842
Could he
have stolen it?

212
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,943
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

213
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,250
I don't know...

214
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,585
Stabler.

215
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,182
Did Donovan ever
see the gun?

216
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,523
Yeah, I was Iooking
for a buyer.

217
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,529
I showed it to a Iot
of people, including Donovan.

218
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,394
Did he see
where you kept it?

219
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,058
Yeah, yeah,
in my desk.

220
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,694
Warner. She wants
to talk to us.

221
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,567
You fumed her.

222
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,667
It's amazing
what you can do
with crazy glue.

223
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,009
Vaporize it,
and when it hardens,
you can dust a print on skin.

224
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,172
Where's the print?

225
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,842
On the inside of her
right wrist, where
there's deep bruising.

226
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,441
STABLER: Like someone
grabbed her hard.

227
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,043
With the glue,
it's as clear as day.

228
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,418
Donovan AIvarez?

229
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,013
Ten point match.

230
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,490
PROFESSOR:
In People v. Carmichael,
the M.E. ruled that the death

231
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,496
was due to undetermined
homicidal violence.

232
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,126
How did the District Attorney
get a conviction?

233
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,136
Donovan AIvarez, you're under
arrest for the murder
of Vanessa Bevins.

234
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,296
PROFESSOR: Hey, what do
you think you're doing?

235
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,464
You can't do this.
Sure we can.

236
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,529
What do you think
you're doing?

237
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,542
Your teacher
cover Miranda yet?
What's going on? Hey!

238
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,508
You have the right
to remain silent.

239
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,045
If you give up that right,
anything you say
can and will be used...

240
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,147
This is your Iast chance,
Donovan.

241
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,617
Just tell us the truth.

242
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,520
Once there's a DNA match,
no one will care
what you say.

243
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,216
I am telling the truth,
all right.

244
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,226
I didn't kill Vanessa.
I only went to the club
to talk to her.

245
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,818
Because you were pissed off
that she broke up with you?

246
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,989
No, I was pissed because
she stole my credit card

247
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,533
and spent thousands
of dollars on crazy stuff.

248
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,228
That sounds Iike a good
motive to drag her out
to the alley and kill her.

249
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,463
No.

250
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,270
We were arguing because
Vanessa said she had bigger
problems than paying me back.

251
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,899
So then you pulled
the gun to make her
take you seriously.

252
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,136
No, I didn't have a gun.

253
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,872
Come on, Donovan.

254
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,574
Vanessa was killed with a gun
stolen from your dorm.

255
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,879
I don't know
anything about that.

256
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,511
Why don't you believe me?
I could never hurt Vanessa.

257
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,613
You grabbed her so hard
your prints were
bruised into her flesh.

258
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,250
She was walking away.
I grabbed her arm
so I could stop her.

259
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,226
Is that when
she scratched your neck?

260
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,853
I cut myself shaving.

261
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,526
See for yourself.

262
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,226
Does this Iook
Iike a scratch?

263
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,696
BENSON: You believe his story?
I don't know.

264
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,400
Vanessa's on drugs,
desperate for money,

265
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,534
she steals from
her ex-boyfriend.
Sounds Iike motive to me.

266
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,273
Donovan can't explain how
Vanessa was shot with a gun
that he had access to?

267
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,717
Something wrong?

268
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,147
Yeah. Ray Bevins,
he called five times.

269
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,020
CRAGEN: DNA's back.

270
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,117
The semen, fingernail
scrapings, and the blood
on the cat's claw,

271
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,923
all come from
the same person.

272
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,055
And it's not
Donovan AIvarez.

273
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,197
So, Vanessa had
sex with someone else
earlier that night,

274
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,100
and then Donovan
shoots her in the alley.

275
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,868
Possible, but not enough to
hold a kid you arrested in
front of a criminal Iaw class.

276
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,067
BENSON: We can't
cut him Ioose.

277
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,770
And we can't
talk to him anymore.

278
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,004
BENSON: Why's that?

279
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,309
Professor called and
Iawyered up for him.

280
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,473
Ray.

281
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,607
Detective.

282
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,173
It's the middle of the night.
What are you doing here?

283
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,446
I called.

284
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,954
I know. I haven't had a chance
to get back to you. I'm sorry.

285
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,388
I just wanted to know
if you had any Ieads.

286
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,449
Yeah, we're making progress.

287
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,888
Can't you tell
me anything?

288
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,489
No. Ray, go home.
Get some sleep.

289
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,556
I can't.

290
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,533
I can't...
I mean,
I can't sleep.

291
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,072
I just keep seeing
Vanessa's face,
in the morgue.

292
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,471
Ray...

293
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,272
If I have any news,
I'II call you.
I promise. You have my word.

294
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,973
Now go home.
Go home.

295
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,615
Hey, how's he doing?

296
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,121
He's a mess.

297
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,225
The Iogs on Vanessa's phone.
Check out this number.

298
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,622
Dozens of calls to it.

299
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,128
It's the Rape
Crisis Center.

300
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,023
Why was Vanessa
calling them two weeks
before she was raped?

301
00:13:56,202 --> 00:14:00,400
Vanessa must've called me
20 times, but she never
gave a Iast name.

302
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,633
I was afraid if I pushed
too hard, she'd stop calling.

303
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,505
I know what she said
is confidential...

304
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,673
And any father would
waive confidentiality
to catch his child's killer.

305
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,273
Let's cut
the red tape.

306
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,283
Good. Why was Vanessa
calling you?

307
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,718
She was in
a sexual relationship
she couldn't handle.

308
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,050
So, she was raped.

309
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,783
She wasn't sure.

310
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,988
She needed help understanding
what had happened to her,
but it was rape all right.

311
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,292
She had gotten involved
with this man that she met.

312
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,991
Donovan AIvarez?

313
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,159
She never gave his name.

314
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,170
He was a sadist.
He Iiked to degrade her.

315
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,173
Make her have sex
in public places.
Get rough.

316
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,505
When she refused,
he beat her up.

317
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,204
After that she was too
scared to say no again.

318
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,008
Why didn't she
call the police?

319
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,673
I gave her your number.

320
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,149
Vanessa just wasn't ready.
She was very depressed.

321
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,516
She kept blaming herself
instead of her boss.

322
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,382
Her boss?

323
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,917
Yeah, that's
who was raping her.

324
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,461
Look, I understand
the need for investigation.

325
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,502
I just don't see
how I can help you.

326
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,629
Well, you were at the club,
weren't you?

327
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,573
I was in the VIP room.
I told that to the officers
who interviewed me.

328
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,611
You didn't tell them
you were sleeping
with the victim.

329
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,338
(SIGHS)

330
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,974
Well, now I see.
Someone's been talking
about me behind my back.

331
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,419
Then Iet's talk openly,
in our squad room.

332
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,724
Baby, I'm going now.
You'II call me Iater?

333
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,683
Come here.

334
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,157
You know I will.

335
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,665
Give me a moment to call
my Iawyer. I'II have him
meet me there.

336
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,798
There's no need to.
You're not under arrest.

337
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,467
And I'd Iike to
keep it that way.

338
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,746
My client is more than
happy to assist in
the investigation.

339
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,976
He'II answer
your questions.

340
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,450
Why don't we Iet
his DNA sample
do the talking?

341
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,647
Oh, hey, take a swab.
It'II match.

342
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,983
I'm sure
you'II find my blood
in the alleyway, too.

343
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,391
Damn cat clawed
the hell out of my ass.

344
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,328
Listen, I had sex
with Vanessa that night.
That's not a crime.

345
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,694
Rape and sodomy are.

346
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,565
(SCOFFS)

347
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,936
Rape? Detective,
I don't need to force
women to have sex with me.

348
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,839
Oh, so you expect
us to believe

349
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,604
that Vanessa Iiked
being half-naked,

350
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,111
down on her knees
in a dirty alley?

351
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,738
Yeah, she grew to Iike it.

352
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,680
Once you stripped away
that schoolgirl exterior,

353
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,117
underneath Iay
a very adventurous woman.

354
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,315
Why'd you go out back?

355
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,052
I don't Iike to
share my girls.

356
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,860
I saw Vanessa go
outside with a friend.

357
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,919
I went to make sure
they weren't
having a quickie.

358
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,123
Were they?

359
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,063
No, no. Her tastes
had changed.

360
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,930
She told him to
get the hell out.

361
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,230
BENSON: So,
did you see him Ieave?

362
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,793
He got into a cab.

363
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:49,307
Vanessa and I had
a Iittle fun,
and then I went back inside.

364
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,503
So she fought
with her boyfriend,
had sex with you,

365
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,604
and then, a third guy
came along and he killed her.

366
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,978
Is that what
you're telling me?

367
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,347
Truth is stranger
than fiction.

368
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,422
But you're the only one
with a history
of abusing Vanessa.

369
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,618
Oh, more gossip?

370
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,923
BENSON: No, we have witnesses.

371
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:14,197
Vanessa told people
about your repeated
sexual assault.

372
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,894
I don't recall anyone
watching us having sex.

373
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,132
So unless you guys
communicate with ghosts,
you've got nothing.

374
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,639
AII right. My client
has answered all
of your questions.

375
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,302
So, unless
you're arresting him,
we're Ieaving.

376
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,366
(CLEARS THROAT)

377
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,314
You'II notify me
if you want to speak
to my client any further.

378
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,012
Oh, we'II be speaking
to him again, yeah.

379
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,315
Come on.

380
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,883
Detective Stabler,
any news about Vanessa?

381
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,017
Are you her father?
Yeah.

382
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,391
Hey, I'm really sorry.

383
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,930
Thanks. Who are you?

384
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,132
Oh, sorry,
Perry Williams.

385
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,828
How do you know
my daughter?

386
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,871
I was her boss.
Let's talk. Come on.

387
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,963
She was really sweet.
What?

388
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,602
Why are you here?

389
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,973
WILLIAMS: I'm just answering
a few questions.

390
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,671
About what?

391
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,338
My relationship
with your daughter.

392
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,473
You bastard! You raped
and murdered my daughter.

393
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,074
Hey, hey, I didn't
have to rape her.

394
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,618
And I sure
didn't kill her.

395
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,176
He's not worth it.
Let him go. AII right?

396
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,279
AII right, all right.
Come on.

397
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,525
Ray, you've gotta
stop coming here.

398
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,959
I got nothing
else to do.

399
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,223
What about your job?

400
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,492
I don't give a damn
about my work anymore.

401
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,664
You're never going
to make an arrest.

402
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,205
It's been three days, Ray.
You gotta give me time.

403
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,504
That filth killed my daughter
and you're just gonna Iet him
walk out the door.

404
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,205
We don't have enough evidence
to arrest him for murder yet.

405
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,110
You could at Ieast
arrest him for rape.

406
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,979
He's claiming their
relationship was consensual.

407
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,316
That's crazy.
We need the proof.

408
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,515
What do you think?
It doesn't matter
what I think, Ray.

409
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,786
In your heart,
what do you think?

410
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,795
We may never know.

PIease...

412
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,003
Just tell me...

413
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,599
Did he rape her?

414
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,773

at him for it.

415
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,650

(SIGHS)

417
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,651
We're gonna
get the guy.

418
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,254
Thanks.

419
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,035
Go home.

420
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,632
You sound Iike
me talking to Ray.

421
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,940
EIIiot, there's nothing
we can do tonight.

422
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,106
We'II start fresh
in the morning.

423
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,309
I need to get
that bastard.

424
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,012
PIenty of other bastards
out there, EIIiot,
why this one?

425
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,488
You know why.

426
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,892
I'm gonna go catch
a few hours of sleep.

427
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,959
See you at 7:00.

428
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,430
Hey, it's Stabler.
Sorry to bother you so Iate,

429
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,194
I need you to do
me a big favor.

430
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,133
You gotta run
the tests tonight.

431
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,472
I burned a sample
of the greasy residue
in the gas chromatograph.

432
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,736
Tell me it nails
Perry Williams.

433
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,300
Hear me out.

434
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,109
The grease on the gun
had three component
organic substances.

435
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,878
The first two are
Ianolin and talc.

436
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,647
Skin care products?
Exactly.

437
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,779
Chemical compositions
identical to the Iotion

438
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,880
and face powder
brands Vanessa used.

439
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,925
So the gun
touched her skin.

440
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,019
It doesn't explain the flakes
trapped in the Iotion.

441
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:35,726
Cured tobacco, same brand
as the cigarettes we found
in Vanessa's purse.

442
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,234
Vanessa was carrying
the gun.

443
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,066
She tried to defend herself.
Perp took it away
and shot her.

444
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,299
You'd think so,

445
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:47,971
but I decided to take
another Iook at the residue
pattern on Vanessa's hands.

446
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,070
Here it is.

447
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,844
But that residue
pattern is not consistent
with any defensive posture.

448
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,014
Not Iike this.
Not Iike this. And so on.

449
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,351
So you have no match.

450
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,288
I think there
might be.

451
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,826
Like this.

452
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,925
Fire in the hole.

453
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,440
It's a match.

454
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,645
Vanessa killed herself.

455
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,754
Perry Williams raped Vanessa
and it drove her to suicide.

456
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,285
She steals the gun,
brings it down to
the alley to kill him,

457
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,353
Ioses her nerve.

458
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:44,095
When Perry rapes her again,
it's the Iast straw,
so she kills herself.

459
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,934
This bastards gonna escape,
we got nothing on the rape.

460
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,441
You know, maybe Vanessa told
someone in person, other than
the rape crisis counselor.

461
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,602
We get an outcry witness,
we got ourselves a chance.

462
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,976
Ray didn't know,
none of her friends knew.

463
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,912
Hell, no one even
knew she was suicidal.

464
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,779
They all say
she was a party girl.

465
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,910
This may explain why.
Vanessa's toxicology report.

466
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,921
It says that her
blood was positive
for Iithium.

467
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,013
What's that used for?

468
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,853
For treating
bi-polar disorder.

469
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,291
No wonder she was
flying high one day,
and crashing the next.

470
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,888
Promiscuous, going on spending
sprees, explains why everyone
thought she was on drugs.

471
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,158
It also explains
her inability

472
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,928
to break off from
Perry Williams despite
his treatment of her.

473
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,264
So why didn't
the Iithium help?

474
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,465
Because the amount
found in her blood
wasn't a therapeutic dose.

475
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,100
My guess is she stopped
taking her meds a week ago.

476
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,508
So why didn't anybody
tell us about her diagnosis?

477
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,773
This is a woman
who suffered in silence.

478
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,645
Now, I gotta tell Ray
his only child killed herself.

479
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,644
First you tell me she's
on drugs. Now you tell me
that she's crazy,

480
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,781
and I'm telling you
I know my daughter,
and she was never suicidal.

481
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,586
If you'd Iike,
you can talk to
our medical examiner.

482
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,320
She can explain how
she came to the findings.

483
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,089
Thank you.
You know what,
I will.

484
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,125
Did you know that she
was taking medication
for bipolar disorder?

485
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,227
She was moody.
I mean, she felt
things very intensely.

486
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,400
She was a caring...
Look, my daughter
was not sick.

487
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,002
Then Vanessa never mentioned
that she was seeing
a psychiatrist?

488
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,238
(SIGHS)

489
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,911
No.

490
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,648
Ray, maybe she was ashamed.

491
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,991
No daughter wants to
disappoint her father.

492
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,257
Vanessa's "problem"
was that bastard
Perry Williams.

493
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,561
He murdered her,
even if he didn't
pull the trigger.

494
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:27,469
But Iegally, Ray,
Iegally he's not
responsible for her death.

495
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,701
Can you give us
the name of her doctor?

496
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,471
I don't know.

497
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:36,844
She was using the college
health care service.

498
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,553
Could you all
just please Ieave?

499
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,327
Vanessa wanted help
controlling her behavior.

500
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,335
The Iithium worked,
and in combination
with psychotherapy...

501
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,106
Well, she was making
excellent progress.

502
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,574
Did she ever mention
a Perry Williams in therapy?

503
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:05,769
Yes.

504
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,177
He was encouraging her
to drink and stop
taking her meds.

505
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,544
STABLER: Why?

506
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,252
To make her more vulnerable,
more manic.

507
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,719
He Iiked being with
a hyper-sexual party girl.

508
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,082
When she began to stabilize,
he Iost his control over her.

509
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,820
That's when she realized
he was abusing her.

510
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,521
Well, why'd she keep
going out with him?

511
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,157
Well, he's a handsome,
successful older man.
She was blinded by his charm.

512
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,361
Our tox screen shows
that Vanessa had stopped
taking the Iithium.

513
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:35,300
Now you know what can happen
to a manic depressive
when they go off their meds.

514
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,772
What did you
do about it?

515
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,070
What could I do?

516
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,304
She's an adult Iegally free
to make her own choices.

517
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,402
STABLER: She was suicidal.

518
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,471
Not Iast week
when I saw her.

519
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:47,848
You should have
told her father
what was going on.

520
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,285
The only way
I could've disclosed anything

521
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:56,794
is if she'd been
homicidal or suicidal
and as I said, she wasn't.

522
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,560
Did Vanessa ever mention
confiding in anybody else?

523
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:07,070
She was keeping
a therapy journal.

524
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,466
Vanessa's roommate had
the diary. I can see why
she kept it hidden from Ray.

525
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,775
It's graphic sexual stuff,
a catalog of
Perry's perversions.

526
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,441
He's a sexual sadist,
he doesn't want a partner,
he wants a victim.

527
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,848
I'm not sure
that's enough.

528
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,512
We talked to several
of Perry's ex-girlfriends.

529
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,351
He gets off on pain,
they'II all testify to that.

530
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,685
Were they raped?

531
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,216
No, but...

532
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,624
But then
it's not enough.

533
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,719
Vanessa's body showed signs
of sexual trauma.

534
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,424
Well, Perry will argue
that it was rough
but consensual sex.

535
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,899
And we've got her statements
to the psychiatrist

536
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,061
and the rape crisis counselor,
that she was forced.

537
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,504
AII right, those I can get
admitted under the outcry
exception to the hearsay rule,

538
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,974
but I would still Iike
a confession from Perry.

539
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,704
AIex, it's all in here.

540
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,268
Everything that
he did to her.

541
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,779
"I'm still bleeding
from Iast night.

542
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,476
"I should go to the hospital,
but I'm too embarrassed
to tell anyone.

543
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,180
"When I said I couldn't have
sex tonight, he punched me
so hard I couldn't breathe."

544
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,184
Let's go after him
for the rape.

545
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,089
But, just in case, tell
Ray to file a civil suit.

546
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,123
CIean Perry out.

547
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,357
At Ieast arresting Perry
might give Ray some closure.

548
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,865
Maybe you, too.

549
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,595
EIIiot, can I talk
to you for a minute?

550
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:11,931
I'II meet you
down in the car.

00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,027
What you got?

552
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,696
Ray Bevins came by
to see me,

553
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,300
asked questions
about why we ruled
Vanessa's death a suicide.

554
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,003
He accept it?

555
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,377
I walked him through
the evidence as gently
as I could, but I screwed up.

556
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,848
I mentioned the oral sodomy.
I thought you told him.

557
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,045
No. I didn't want to put
that image in his head.

558
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,111
His daughter on her knees
in some filthy alley.

559
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,350
I'm sorry,
but it's in there now.

She wouldn't
want you to do this.

00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,414
He killed a sexual predator
that you said
we couldn't convict.

608
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,952
I will not
condone vigilantism.

609
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,984
I am not going to Iet
my compassion for Ray
prevent me from doing my job.

610
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,651
Well, I did my job.
I arrested him.
He's all yours.

611
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,894
I want manslaughter
and probation. Extreme
emotional disturbance.

612
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,632
Ray snapped when he found out
his daughter's rapist would go
unpunished for his crime.

613
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,436
For someone who snapped,
your client was
thinking clearly enough

614
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,740
to obtain a weapon,
Iocate the defendant,
and execute him.

615
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,713
That's not
temporary insanity.

616
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:20,842
You know the EED
statute was designed
to downgrade murder charges,

617
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,945
when they are
mitigated by the defendant's
severe psychological trauma.

618
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,958
Only when the defendant's
mental state creates a Ioss
of self-control.

619
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,324
Ray's actions appear
deliberate and rational.

620
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,364
Don't take our word for it,
have your shrink evaluate Ray.

621
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,259
Perry Williams
killed my daughter.

622
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,967
He took her to
such a dark place that
she couldn't find a way out.

623
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,375
So what did you do?

624
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,970
Guy I know at the work site
gave me the gun.

625
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:55,578
I went to the club,
said I had an appointment
with Perry

626
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,881
and waited in his office.

627
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,257
And what happened after that?

628
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,289
Perry walked in.

629
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:09,298
I confronted him
with Vanessa's rape.

630
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,096
He denied it, and then...

631
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,771
Then he said that she Iiked
what he did to her.

632
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,806
Ray, how did Perry
end up in the alley?

633
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,318
I took him there.

634
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,287
I forced him to his knees,
the way he forced
Vanessa to her knees.

635
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:36,350
He begged for his Iife,
he swore that he would
tell the truth to the cops.

636
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,262
I said enough,
you know, enough Iies.

637
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,336
So I put the gun in his mouth,
and I pulled the trigger.

638
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,077
Ray's emotional pain
is genuine

639
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,177
and the cause for his mental
trauma is Iegitimate,

640
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,812
but I don't buy
his affirmative defense.

641
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,016
Why the hell not?
This is a man who's
Iost his daughter.

642
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,151
Well, despite his
emotional distress,
he had the presence of mind

643
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,526
to carefully
plan this murder.
He knew right from wrong.

644
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,430
He knew nothing.
This is a guy
drowning in grief.

645
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,992
HUANG: Ray made clear,
Iogical, and deliberate
choices.

646
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,560
He forced Perry
out into that alley

647
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,106
and symbolically re-enacted
his daughter's rape
and murder.

648
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,641
He didn't shoot
Perry in the chest.

649
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:29,112
No, he put the gun
in Perry's mouth,
imitating the oral sodomy.

650
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,273
I'II notify Ray's attorney
that we're gonna fight it.

651
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:35,046
She'II probably try for
jury nullification, get them
to acquit out of sympathy.

652
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,450
They should.

653
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,149
Look. I'm not mourning
for Perry Williams,

654
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,248
but I'm not rolling
over for Ray, either.

655
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,123
I need that report as
soon as you can get it.

656
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,828
I could've stopped him.
I should've known
what Ray was gonna do.

657
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,828
How?

658
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,303
I'd have done
the same thing.

659
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,737
No, you wouldn't.

660
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,070
Wait till
you're a parent.

661
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,238
Don't throw that
crap at me, EIIiot.
You made a mistake.

662
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,541
What?

663
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,314
You Iet Ray in.

664
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,421
You're right, I did.

665
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,827
He got to me,
and now I'm responsible.

666
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,300
I don't remember
Ieaving the nightclub.

667
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,273
EMMETT: What's the next
thing you do remember?

668
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,607
Sitting in the park,
by the Iake.

669
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:42,352
Vanessa and I went there
since she was a Iittle girl.

670
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:48,448
She would feed the ducks her
sandwiches when she thought
I wasn't Iooking.

671
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,517
But you still had the gun?

672
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,451
Yes.

673
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,124
What were you
going to do next?

674
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,697
Shoot myself,
so that I could be
with my daughter.

675
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,235
Thank you.
No further questions.

676
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,838
You blame Perry Williams
for your daughter's death?

677
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,952
Yeah, he raped Vanessa
and that's why
she killed herself.

678
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,783
CABOT: You sound very
certain of that.

679
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,255
But Vanessa was
emotionally unstable,
wasn't she?

680
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,450
BEVINS: He made her that way.

681
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,551
Mr. Bevins, she was
under psychiatric care

682
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,153
and had been
prescribed Iithium
for a bipolar disorder.

683
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,960
Are you suggesting
that Perry Williams
was responsible for that?

684
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:33,766
He Iowered her self-esteem,
and told her not to
take her medication.

685
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,341
My daughter was
happy and healthy,

686
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,535
before she
worked at that club.

687
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,237
As far as you knew.

688
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:45,078
There was quite a bit
about her Iife that
Vanessa did not tell you.

689
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,447
Did she tell you
that she had been
sexually assaulted?

690
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,844
No.

691
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,912
CABOT: So her relationship
with Perry Williams

692
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,219
could have been
consensual as he claimed.

693
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,393
You call the deceased
a rapist, but you have
no evidence

694
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,828
other than your
personal beliefs.

695
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,330
That's not true.

696
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:05,062
Detective Stabler told me
that Perry Williams
raped my daughter.

697
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,601
Thank you.
Nothing further.

698
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,677
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

699
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,271
You're calling
me to the stand?

700
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,647
No, the Defense is.

701
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,948
You've just become
their star witness.

702
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,785
Excuse me?

703
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:29,154
EIIiot, did you tell Ray
that you knew Perry Williams
had raped Vanessa?

704
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,956
No.
He says you did.

705
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,193
I told him
Perry was a suspect.

706
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,496
Now they're going to
use you to justify
Ray murdering Perry.

707
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,502
Yeah? Well, the hell with him.
He got what he deserved.

708
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,333
Well, now it's your turn.

709
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:45,000
You gave premature information
to an unstable man.

710
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,042
You sure as hell
better be ready
when I cross-examine you.

711
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,416
Detective Stabler,
did you have a conversation

712
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,652
with Ray Bevins
about Perry Williams?

713
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,185
Yes.

714
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,594
Do you remember the content
of that conversation?

715
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,097
Not word for word, no.

716
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,895
Do you remember
telling Ray Bevins

717
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,435
that you believed
Perry Williams
raped his daughter?

718
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,029
I said we were
Iooking at him.

719
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,507
Did you say, quote,
"We're gonna get the guy."

720
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,535
Yes, I said that.

721
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,010
Who did "the guy" refer to?

722
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,571
STABLER: The killer. It didn't
necessarily mean that I was
Iooking at Perry Williams.

723
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,381
But it's reasonable to assume
that Ray believed
you meant Mr. Williams.

724
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,822
Now, did you tell Ray
that you were powerless
to arrest Mr. Williams?

725
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,791
At the time,
we didn't have
enough evidence.

726
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,351
Yes or no, Detective.

727
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,262
At the time of the murder
did my client believe

728
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:44,665
you would ever be able
to arrest Mr. Williams?

729
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,834
No.

730
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,868
Thank you.

731
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,478
"We're gonna get the guy."

732
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,608
Detective Stabler,
when you made that
remark to the defendant,

733
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,779
was it based on
any official determination
from the NYPD?

734
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,482
"Official determination"? No.

735
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,958
Was it based on
any forensic evidence?

736
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,258
Yes, we had Perry Williams'
DNA on Vanessa's body.

737
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,993
DNA proves that sex
took place, not rape.

738
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,159
We had her diary.

739
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,998
A person, Detective,
not her writings.

740
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,503
We had the rape
crisis counselor.

741
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,198
An eyewitness, Detective.

742
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:27,971
No.

743
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,203
So your statement
to the defendant,

744
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:35,014
that Perry Williams raped
Vanessa was based purely
on your individual opinion?

745
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,585
Yes.

746
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,023
Then why did
you say that?

747
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,889
Because he needed
something to hold onto.

748
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,326
So your sympathy
for the defendant

749
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,854
Ied you to give Ray Bevins
unsubstantiated information?

750
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,230
Yes.

751
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:57,338
Detective Stabler,
do you condone Ray Bevins'
murder of Perry Williams?

752
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,273
Detective?

753
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,051
No.

754
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,757
It was wrong.

755
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,193
Nothing further.

756
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:34,039
The Iaw is supposed to provide
us with safety and justice

757
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,239
but the Iaw failed to get
justice for Vanessa Bevins.

758
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,941
And in his time of grief,

759
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:44,977
Ray Bevins Iearned that
the man who had abused,
humiliated,

760
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,548
and raped his daughter
was going to walk free.

761
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,590
Now, if it were your daughter,

762
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,363
your wife, your mother,
who had been raped

763
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:03,567
and the police were unable
to arrest their attacker,
how would you feel?

764
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,979
Ray Bevins suffered
every parent's nightmare.

765
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,882
He did what every parent
knows in their heart
they would do.

766
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,080
He acted from
a place of profound grief,
of overwhelming Ioss.

767
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,717
He did not have
control of his actions.

768
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,853
He tried to get
justice for his daughter
in the only way he knew how.

769
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,788
And now you must make
justice for Ray Bevins,

770
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,328
and return a verdict
of not guilty.

771
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,511
Some of you may believe that
Perry Williams raped
Vanessa Bevins in that alley,

772
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,081
but Perry Williams
is not on trial here.

773
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,920
In fact, he never got
his day in court at all.

774
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,153
So in the eyes of the Iaw,
he is innocent
until proven guilty.

775
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:01,564
Even if his guilt
had been established
beyond a reasonable doubt,

776
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:04,192
he could not
have been executed
for his crime.

777
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,765
Ray Bevins executed
Perry Williams.

778
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:12,665
He shot a man,
who was on his knees,
begging for his Iife.

779
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,011
Now some of you may think
that he deserved to die.

780
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,708
But you have to
ask yourselves

781
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,980
if you would execute
a man whose guilt had
not been proven.

782
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,355
We have all felt
the need for revenge
at some point in our Iives.

783
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,893
We have all Iashed
out in pain and anger,

784
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,555
and we have all thought
that justice means
an eye for an eye.

785
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,360
But is that justice?

786
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,864
Does Perry Williams' family
now have the right
to kill Ray Bevins?

787
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,429
Does Ray Bevins' family then
have the right to retaliate
against Perry Williams?

788
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,236
When would it stop?

789
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,975
An eye for an eye
Ieaves the whole world blind.

790
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,151
LARSEN: Has the jury
reached its verdict?

791
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,854
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

792
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,920
Will the defendant
please rise?

793
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,968
LARSEN: On the count of murder
in the Second Degree,
how does the jury find?

794
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,342
We find the defendant,
Raymond Bevins,
guilty.

795
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,980
LARSEN: Thank you for
your service. You're excused.

796
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,599
Ray.

797
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,167
I'm sorry.

798
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,276
I'm not.
