NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:06,731
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,966
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,976
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,571
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,342
These are their stories.

What in the hell
were you thinking?

9
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,814
You said to invite people.

10
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,253
I said, "Bring a friend,"
not 25 slobs.

11
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,517
You're out of cold beer.

12
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,751
Guess you should
go home, then.

13
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,588
You've got a phone call.
Whoever it is, I'm busy.

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,959
It's your neighbor.
It's something about
music and the cops.

15
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,033
Mrs. Grenis.
I'm turning it down.

00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,301
Believe me, I'd Iove
for these parasites to Ieave.

(GLASS SHATTERING)
Okay. Oh, my God.

18
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,274
What are you doing
to my house?

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,749
Open the door.
Open the damn door!

20
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,187
What the hell happened?

21
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,416
He tried to rape me.

22
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,221
Rape victim's
a Cheryl Avery, 19.

23
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,093
Medic's checking her
out on the bus.

She hurt bad?

on the head with a vase.

Where is the
alleged attacker?

27
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,337
Oh, he's on way to Cabrini.
His name's a Joe Cappilla.

28
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,637
Miss Avery claims
he tried to rape her.

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,076
Well, it sounds Iike
you think she made it up.

30
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,307
Well, her blouse is torn
and her face was bruised,

31
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,907
but she refuses to go to
the ER to get checked out.

32
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,249
She was violated.
Doesn't want to be poked at.

33

Detective Benson, SVU.
Where's your patient?

34
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,616
In back.
No, she's not.

35
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,752
She was here a minute ago.

36
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,922
Must've bailed.

37
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,100
Son of a bitch.

38
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,349
Looks Iike they struggled.
See these black scuff marks?

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,823
Perp was wearing sneakers,
so these probably came
from Cheryl Avery's heels.

40
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,259
He shoved her backwards
into the window,
the glass broke,

41
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,354
she grabbed the vase
and whacked him with it.

42
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,991
Went down and banged
his head on the tub.

43
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,431
FIN: Find Cheryl yet?
Nope.

44
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,733
And neither did the sector car
I sent to her house.

45
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,864
The address she gave
the uniform is phony.

46
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,068
I wouldn't be surprised
if her name is, too.

47
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,010
Well, this was a party.
Somebody had to invite her.

48
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,673
I invited five friends over
for pizza and beer.

49
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,649
That Joe and Cheryl, they
weren't even on the Iist.

50
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,515
BENSON: Do you know them?
No. I don't hang out
with rapists.

51
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,385
And the first time
I saw Cheryl was in
my bathroom bleeding.

52
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,616
So who invited them?

53
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,558
(SIGHS) Name's Ricky.
Freaking social director.

54
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:19,787
Ricky, what can you
tell us about Joe?

55
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,994
Met him at a club.

56
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,037
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Thought he was cute
till he showed up high

57
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,231
and started hitting on
every girl in the room.

58
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,467
Joe hit on Cheryl?

59
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,769
Didn't see it,

60
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,810
but maybe that's why
he was fighting
with his brother.

61
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,539
Joe's brother was here?
Yeah.

62
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,047
Name's Eddie.
Cheryl's his girlfriend.

63
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,810
You have any idea
where Eddie Iives?

64
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,047
With Joe and their mom,
23rd and 9th.

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,348
Hospital.

66
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,287
Joe going to be okay?

67
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,914
No, Joe's dead.

68
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,593
My mom called
from the hospital

69
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,859
and told me everything, so...

70
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,594
We're so sorry
for your Ioss.

71
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,363
Eddie, we need to find out
what happened at that party.

72
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,874
My brother tried
to rape my girlfriend.

73
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,112
That's what the hospital
told my mom.

74
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,910
What did you see?

75
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,414
I Ieft early.

76
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,453
How come?

77
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,852
I started having
palpitations.

78
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,982
From fighting
with your brother?

79
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,050
Yeah. I got
a heart condition,

80
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:26,428
so I came home
to take my medicine.

81
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,990
BENSON: You didn't take
Cheryl with you?

82
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,433
I told her to stay.

83
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,734
She was dancing,
having a good time...

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,935
Bum Ieg keep you
from dancing with her?

85
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,503
Yeah, I sprained my ankle
playing hoops.

86
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,541
I know, with a heart
condition, it's stupid.

87
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,641
Eddie,

88
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,050
why were you and
your brother fighting?

89
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,649
He's a punk.
He treated women Iike dirt.

90
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,392
He ever get rough?

91
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,862
Yeah, when he got high,
which was all the time.

92
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,490
That's what we were
fighting about.

93
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,697
Cheryl is the nicest girl
I ever met.

94
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,937
She wouldn't hit Joe
unless he provoked her.

95
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,946
I mean, if she says it was
self-defense, then it was.

96
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,481
She ran away.

97
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,313
That Iooks real bad.

98
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,217
You want to help her?

99
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,619
Tell us where she is.

100
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,556
I wanted to tell Eddie
what happened,

101
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,254
but I didn't think
he'd understand.

102
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,763
BENSON: We're having
a hard time ourselves, Cheryl.

103
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,890
Why did you Ieave
the ambulance?

104
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,967
I thought you
wouldn't believe me.

105
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,435
It would be Joe's word
against mine.

106
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,200
AII we've got is your word.
Joe's dead.

107
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,633
Oh, my God.

108
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,307
Oh, my God.

109
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,049
I didn't...

110
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,318
I didn't mean to kill him.

111
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,588
Cheryl, tell us
what happened.

112
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,714
Will I go to jail?

113
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,623
Not if he attacked you,
it's self-defense.

114
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,555
Oh, God.

115
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,521
I...

116
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,862
I went to the bathroom
and Joe followed me in.

117
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,730
I tried to be nice to him
for Eddie's sake, but,

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,366
God, he's so disgusting.

119
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,966
He's constantly
putting Eddie down.

120
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,606
And I told him to get out,
but he wouldn't Ieave.

121
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,670
Did he touch you?

122
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,274
He put his hands on my...
On my breasts.

123
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:29,317
I tried to yell for help
but the music was too Ioud.

124
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,152
Then he ripped my shirt

125
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,055
and he punched me in the face.

126
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:40,058
And I grabbed something
and I hit him,
but he fought back.

127
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,360
So I pushed him off me,

128
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,235
and that's when he fell
and hit the tub.

129
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,671
So are you going to indict
Cheryl or give her a pass?

130
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,609
No, I'm in no hurry
to convene a grand jury.

131
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,876
The crime Iab confirmed
Cheryl's account,
it's justifiable homicide.

132
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:57,973
What else have we got?

133
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,382
Tox-screen on Joe.
Positive for crystal meth.

134
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,683
That explains his
pugnacious personality.

135
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,586
Yeah, still here.
Those bruises are real, AIex.

136
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,648
He definitely hit her.
Does Cheryl have any priors?

137
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,991
She's clean. But Joe isn't.
26 has a sexual
assault complaint

138
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,053
filed by a Paige Salinsky.

139
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,189
Was Joe arrested?

140
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,893
MUNCH: Miss Salinsky
dropped the charges.

141
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,628
So Joe has a habit
of getting high,

142
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,829
abusing women,
and his own brother
thinks he's a hump.

143
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,430
Well, don't forget
his brother just happens
to be the victim's boyfriend.

144
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,667
Joe's the only one
who can't speak.

145
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,676
Maybe his wounds still can.

146
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,804
If Joe did attack Cheryl,
he may have injuries
to show for it.

147
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,781
Check with EMS
and the medical examiner.

148
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,615
Yeah, I remember.
Got him stabilized
halfway to the hospital

149
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,247
when he seized,
went into cardiac arrest.

150
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,483
DOA.

151
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,686
Doc told us Iater that
the blows to the head caused
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

152
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,252
Well, did you notice
any other injuries?

153
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,991
Scratches, swelling?

154
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,533
Three knuckles
on his right hand
were cut up.

155
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,262
Bruise on Cheryl's face
was on the Ieft side.

156
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,633
So he punches her
with his right,

157
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,171
he cuts his hand
on her teeth.

158
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,900
Hey, you remember
anything else?

159
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,942
Before the seizure,
the guy was rambling.

160
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,998
Any of it make sense?

161
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,510
You tell me.

162
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,514
"Get Eddie, get Eddie.
He did it, he did it."

163
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,744
Are you sure that
he said Eddie?

164
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,548
Anything the patient says,
I write down.

165
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,613
Sounds Iike Cheryl
didn't tell us everything.

166
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,483
VERONICA: May I help you?

167
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,585
BENSON: Yeah,
we're Iooking for Cheryl.

168
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,256
In back. She's got company.

169
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,668
BENSON: Looks Iike
we're interrupting.

170
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,734
STABLER: Guess they had to
get their stories straight.

171
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,003
What do you mean?

172
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,071
Stop screwing us around,
the both of you.

173
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,479
Look, I told you
what happened.

174
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,347
BENSON: Yeah, you Ieft out
a few details.

175
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,442
Like what?

176
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,317
That bathroom window
was broken out.

177
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,380
It's a fifteen foot
drop to the ground.

178
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,789
How'd you really
sprain your ankle?

179
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,952
Wait, Eddie had
nothing to do with this.

180
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,019
STABLER: That's not
what Joe said.

181
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,757
What are you talking about?

182
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,494
In the ambulance,
before he died.

183
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,798
He said, "He did it.
Get Eddie."

184
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,807
Joe tried to rape me.
I hit him, he fell and
he banged his head.

185
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,041
Cheryl, you're hindering
a murder investigation.

186
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,242
Now, Joe said
that Eddie did it.

187
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,046
And I understand
that you're trying to

188
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,347
protect him.
Eddie went home.

189
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,409
We know that.

190
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,980
But we have witnesses that
saw Eddie and Joe fighting,
and then Eddie Ieft.

191
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,582
But he came back,
didn't he?

192
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,821
No. No.

193
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,387
If Joe was attacking you
and Eddie

194
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,364
walked in and came
to your defense,

195
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,401
then Joe's death
is an accident.

196
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,299
You tried to stop him,
it got out of hand.

197
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,803
You didn't mean
to kill anybody.

198
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,396
That's not what happened.

199
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,770
Eddie, no one's
gonna put you away

200
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,365
for protecting
your girlfriend.

201
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,968
I swear I never
touched Joe.

202
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,048
Oh, Eddie.

203
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,083
Okay, Eddie. Okay,
so I've got this all wrong.

204
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,783
Maybe Joe didn't try
to rape Cheryl, huh?

205
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:52,983
Of course he did.

206
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,993
No, you know
what I'm thinking?

207
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,585
You caught Joe and
Cheryl getting it on

208
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,653
behind your back
in that bathroom.
No.

209
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,723
No, no.
The betrayal,
the blind rage...

210
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,301
Cheryl Ioves me.

211
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,337
BENSON: Were you
making out with Joe?

212
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,271
Oh, my God, I would...
No, I would never
do that to Eddie.

213
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,402
Of course you didn't mean to,
but Eddie Ieft you alone
at a party with Joe,

214
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,775
so he starts making
the moves on you,

215
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,006
you got caught up
in the moment.

216
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,275
Wait, wait. No, no, no.

217
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,907
So you didn't want
Eddie to know...
You're wrong...

218
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,112
So when he walked in,
you said that Joe
was raping you.

219
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,485
And he responded Iike
any good boyfriend would.

220
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,545
STABLER: You hit Joe.

221
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,387
No, I didn't.
You went back to the party

222
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,551
to bring Cheryl home.
Don't do this.

223
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,753
You find her
in the bathroom...
What?

224
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,591
...with your brother's
hands all over her.

225
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,689
Come on, Eddie, be a man.
Don't Iet your girlfriend
go down

226
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,166
for something
you did.
Okay!

227
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,467
I was in the room.
I was there.

228
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,631
Just tell me what happened.

229
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,675
He was being a prick

230
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:48,043
to some of the girls
at the party.
And I told him, "Stop."

231
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,482
He got pissed,
gave me a shove,

232
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,142
then I Ieft.
We know,

233
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,653
to go home and get your pills.
We've been through that!

234
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,322
Why are you telling me that?

235
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,756
I want to know,
why did you come back?

236
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,988
I felt bad 'cause
I Ieft Cheryl there.

237
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,326
Joe was already
on the floor

238
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,662
when I walked
into that bathroom.

239
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,698
Cheryl Iocked the door,
said Joe tried to rape her,

240
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,530
just Iike she told you.

241
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,732
So you didn't see anything.

242
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,468
That's awful convenient.
Why would you jump
out the window?

243
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,102
She said people
would think I did it

244
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,170
'cause they saw Joe
and me fighting earlier.

245
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,642
(GROANING)

246
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,947
Cheryl was only trying
to protect me.

247
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,156
Eddie says he was
in the bathroom,

248
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,196
Cheryl says he wasn't.
I can't tell who's
covering for whom.

249
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,960
Eddie fought with his brother
in front of a dozen witnesses.

250
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,058
His brother winds up dead.

251
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,932
What if the rape itself
is the Iie?

252
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,272
Do you think Cheryl made
the whole thing up?

253
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,863
To cover for Eddie.

254
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,239
He kills Joe in the bathroom,
Cheryl walks in,

255
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,504
tells Eddie to go
out the window,

256
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,307
she'II say Joe was
trying to rape her.

257
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,905
Well, then they're
co-conspirators. And
I can't use anything

258
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,540
either one of them
says against the other

259
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,209
without independent
corroboration.

260
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,551
We canvassed
everyone at the party.
Nobody saw anything.

261
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,989
Let's see whose story the
physical evidence supports.

262
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,627
We're not done with
the reconstruction yet,
but I can tell you

263
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,188
that everyone's prints
are in that bathroom.

264
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,494
Eddie admits
he was there.

265
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,557
There's no surprise.

266
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,468
This will be.
This is Joe's shirt.

267
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,438
The blood on it
only belongs to him.

268
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,565
This is Cheryl's.

269
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,302
Two different blood types,
both male.

270
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,934
One matches Joe,
the other's unknown.

271
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,603
So it's gotta be Eddie's.
It's not.

272
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,844
Y-chromosomes from the DNA
say the samples come
from two unrelated males.

273
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,782
So now we got another guy
in that bathroom with Joe,
Eddie and Cheryl?

274
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,584
That's what I thought
until I tested this.

275
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,748
STABLER: You get that
out of the bathroom?

276
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,257
No. From EMS.

277
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,918
Medics used it to wrap
Cheryl's bloody hand,

278
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,552
then we collected it
for evidence.

279
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,655
It's called a control sample
because the only blood on it
is Cheryl's.

280
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,324
Well, what's that
gonna tell us?

281
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,560
I compared the blood
on the bandage

282
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,229
to our unknown male.
It was a match.

283
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,277
Cheryl's a man?

284
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,937
What in the hell
are we dealing with?

285
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,949
Probably a pre-op
transsexual.

286
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,211
STABLER: If she's still
got her package,

287
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,446
it explains why she didn't
go to the hospital
to be examined.

288
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,513
I've seen
plenty of trannies,
but she is amazing.

289
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,217
She's gotta be
taking hormones.

290
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,487
Boys with breasts get
more money on the street.

291
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,291
I don't make her for a pro.
She's got a straight job.

292
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,264
Probably saving up enough
money for the surgery.

293
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,890
Well, none of this
changes the fact

294
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,264
that Joe still
tried to rape her.

295
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,700
She's got the bruises
to show for it.

296
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,330
Maybe he got violent
when he discovered
her secret.

297
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,397
Or Joe threatened
to tell Eddie,

298
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,067
giving Cheryl motive
to kill him.

299
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,235
STABLER: Eddie's gotta know.

300
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,438
He and Cheryl have
been going out for
a couple of months now.

301
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,276
They were all over each other
when we picked them up.

302
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,839
So they're both covering up
Cheryl's secret.

303
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,613
Who do you think
we should try to break first?

304
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,847
Cheryl's pulling
all the strings,
telling Eddie what to say.

305
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,322
My guess is he's
the weaker Iink.

306
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,162
Eddie, I know you've
been through a Iot.

307
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,898
I don't want to
make things worse.

308
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,060
What do you mean?

309
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,161
I'm not here to judge you.

310
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,398
You know that, right?

311
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,406
I just want to find out what
happened in that bathroom.

312
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,772
I already told you.

313
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,346
I walked into the bathroom.

314
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:13,609
Joe was on the floor.
Cheryl was beat up.

315
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,215
You didn't tell us
about Cheryl, though.

316
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,384
What about her?

317
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,260
What you do
in your private Iife
is your business.

318
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,528
You gotta start
being honest with me.

319
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,602
I am being honest. What?

320
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,440
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

321
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm talking about
Cheryl being a man.

322
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,378
(SCOFFS)

323
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:58,354
What kind of
sick joke is this?

324
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,461
I'm sorry you had to
find out this way.

325
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,594
You're crazy.

326
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,763
(CHUCKLES)

327
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,071
I have... I've seen her...
I've seen her breasts.

328
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,303
Female hormones.

329
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,104
They can do that.
Look, Eddie,
she had us all fooled.

330
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,583
We did a blood test.

331
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,582
(YELLING)

332
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,822
(GRUNTS) What are you
saying to me?

333
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,786
I held her! I kissed her.

334
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,966
I wanted to spend my Iife
with her. What are you...

335
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,176
She wouldn't have sex.

336
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,646
She said she wanted to wait.

337
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,515
She would just
push my hands away.

338
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,522
Oh, God. I need to see her,

339
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,753
I need to see her.
I want to talk to her.
Eddie.

340
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,165
Eddie!
Don't.

341
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,198
What's wrong with you?

342
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,799
Why are you Iooking
at me Iike that?

343
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,771
Say something.

344
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,641
Oh, oh!

345
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,147
You are a freak!
No!

346
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,751
STABLER: Eddie, get off.
Eddie. Eddie.

347
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,289
Okay?

348
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,865
Look, I was gonna tell you.

349
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,958
When?

350
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,900
After I had the surgery.

351
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,938
Oh, you make me sick.

352
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,073
Oh, God.

353
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,012
Why did you do this? Why?

354
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,751
Cheryl, stand up, come on.
It's okay. Come on, come on.

355
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,250
We thought that Eddie knew.

356
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,054
We thought that
he was protecting you.

357
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,227
How Iong did you think
that you could keep
this a secret?

358
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:17,359
I just thought if I could
make him Iove me enough,
he'd understand.

359
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,566
Okay, well, Iet's sit down.
Come on. Come on, sit down.

360
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,747
But you were also afraid
that he wouldn't understand.

361
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,980
For the first time in my Iife,
I had someone who Ioves me.

362
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,322
And if Joe was to tell Eddie,
that would be over.

363
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,091
My Iife would be over.

364
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,791
So what happened?

365
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,531
Joe was walking
out of the bathroom,

366
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,970
so I picked up the vase
and I hit him.

367
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,537
And then Eddie walked in.

368
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,372
I never meant to kill Joe.

369
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,014
I just didn't
want him to talk.

370
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,587
You'II have to tell Eddie
that I didn't mean to do it.

371
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,624
I mean, please make him
understand that.

372
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,324
You okay?

373
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,924
Oh, I'II never be okay.

374
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,838
This wasn't your fault.

375
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,464
Yeah, it was.

376
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:34,976
My brother's dead because
my girlfriend's a guy.

377
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,239
I should've...

378
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,909
No one knew.

379
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:48,350
What if I did know,
deep down?

380
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,197
You were in Iove with a woman.

381
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,768
That's what you knew.

382
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,636
You sure you're
okay? Huh?
Yeah.

383
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,702
I need some air.

384
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,837
Whoa!

385
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,340
I need some help in here!

386
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,249
What happened?
He just collapsed.

387
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,447
He's got a heart condition.

388
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,582
Call an ambulance.
Hardly has any pulse.

389
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,920
STABLER: This is empty.

390
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,654
Digoxin.
It's stopping his heart.

391
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,491
We got a drug overdose.

392
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,890
I'm Iosing his pulse.
You better start CPR.

393
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,795
Eddie!

394
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,199
Come on, Eddie!

395
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,302
Come on, Eddie!

396
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,375
He was pulseless
for ten minutes.

397
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,574
I pronounced him
at 1815.

398
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,708
You got
the pill vial?

399
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,944
Yeah, it's right here.

400
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,079
I'II do the autopsy,
I'II get you the results
quick as I can,

401
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,282
but doesn't Iook to me
Iike anything
other than a suicide.

402
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,121
It's a death in custody,
suicide or not.

403
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,354
You guys from
Internal Affairs

404
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,396
are Iike sharks smelling
blood a mile away.

405
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,555
Save it, Captain.

406
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,859
I got an investigation
to conduct.

407
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,401
You think we forced the pills
down his throat?

408
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,833
TUCKER: No, but you
Ieft a Iethal dose

409
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,498
of pharmaceuticals
in possession of
a distraught suspect.

410
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,538
Talk to me
through my delegate.

411
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,238
That distraught suspect
needed those pills
for a heart condition.

412
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,781
That still doesn't mitigate
your failure to supervise

413
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,543
Detective Stabler
and Agent Huang.

414
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,484
IAB doesn't have
jurisdiction
over Doctor Huang.

415
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,683
We'II refer his conduct
to the FBI's Office of
Professional Responsibility.

416
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:29,215
I hope your
med-mal insurance
is paid up, Doc.

417
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,702
COURT OFFICER: AII rise.
The Honorable
Judge Seligman presiding.

418
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,895
CLERK: Now in session.

419
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,964
Docket ending 5971,
"People v. Cheryl Avery.

420
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,703
"One count, murder
in the second degree."

421
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,711
Morton Berger
for the defense, Your Honor.

422
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,475
We all know
who you are, Mr. Berger.

423
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,948
How does your client plead?

424
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,507
Not guilty.

425
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,574
SELIGMAN: Ms. Cabot?

426
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,245
Uh... Remand.

427
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,617
My client is not
a threat to the community.

428
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,022
She has no prior
criminal record, Your Honor.

429
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,118
And you can't hold
a press conference
in a Iock-up.

430
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,287
She's out of Iine,
Your Honor.

431
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,092
Oh, come on, Morty.
You wouldn't have
taken this case

432
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,689
if you didn't smell
the publicity.

433
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,565
Bail is set at $200,000.

434
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,037
Mr. Berger, are you going with
an insanity defense?

435
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,008
Absolutely not.
This case is entirely about
society's prejudice...

436
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,637
REPORTER 1:
Ms. Cabot, Ms. Cabot,
a few questions, please.

437
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,806
Ms. Cabot, hold on.
The D.A.'s office
will try this case

438
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,009
in the courtroom,
not the press. Thank you.

439
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,346
REPORTER 2: Come on,
Ms. Cabot, give us a break.

440
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,784
REPORTER 3: Come on,
just help us out here.

441
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,754
Just something, huh?
Come on.

442
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,450
Don't want your 15
minutes of fame, AIex?

443
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,652
I hear you paid
Cheryl's bail.
That's a nice touch.

444
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,525
Can't take the full credit.
That was the generosity
of my firm.

445
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,360
Well, Cheryl makes
a Iovely poster child,

446
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,161
so I'm guessing you're
doing this pro bono.

447
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,498
And you work
for a pittance,
so we're even.

448
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,127
You're wasting your time.

449
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,365
The judge is never
going to suppress
Cheryl's confession.

450
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,532
Good.

451
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:53,339
I need it to support
my argument that she
acted in self-defense.

452
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,074
Joe Cappilla was
Ieaving the bathroom.
The threat had abated.

453
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,615
Her Iife was
no Ionger in danger.

454
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,675
Yeah, until Joe told
the waiting Iynch mob
she was transsexual.

455
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,312
Predictions of violence
are notoriously unreliable.

456
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,253
Nobody can say what
Joe might have done.

457
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,348
Come on.

458
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,025
We both know what people do
when they find out the truth
about the trans-gendered.

459
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:12,959
They kill them.

460
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,731
Now, Cheryl's not responsible
for beating Joe to death

461
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,202
because she's trans-gendered.
Well, that's an excuse.

462
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,239
It is, and it works.
You think
she's gonna walk?

463
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:25,402
I doubt it. The irony is
Berger's argument may
actually work for our case.

464
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,037
People are generally hostile
towards the trans-gendered.

465
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,171
So a jury will be, too.

466
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,842
Berger's gonna put witnesses
up there for Cheryl,
or whatever his name is,

467
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,682
to tell us all about
how he grew up
tormented, brutalized,

468
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,982
and treated Iike a freak.

469
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,387
You know, it sounds Iike you
have a problem with Cheryl.

470
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,518
My problem is this he-she
and her Iies are the reason

471
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,822
we've got two dead bodies
on our hands,

472
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,294
and I'm the one
who's all jammed up?

473
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,195
Look, I need background
on Cheryl now.

474
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,358
AII we know so far is that

475
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,265
she changed her name when
she was 18 years old.

476
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,361
She used to be called
Charles Avery.

477
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,996
Her parents still Iive
in AIphabet City.

478
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,233
Then why don't you
go talk to them?

479
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,037
Maybe they can undercut
Cheryl's abuse story.

480
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,237
I don't know, AIex.
I talked to her.

481
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,677
And unless she's
a damned good actor,

482
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,271
she is completely
in Iove with Eddie

483
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,474
and was afraid
of Iosing him.

484
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,846
So she kills
Eddie's brother?

485
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,646
True Iove doesn't
mitigate murder.

486
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,914
I don't think
she's a violent person.

487
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,785
That's fine. Prove it.

488
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,697
Charlie was 16
when he started
growing breasts.

489
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,596
Stole the hormones his mother
was taking for menopause.

490
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,655
We couldn't take it anymore.

491
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,826
Is that when she Ieft?

492
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,891
JOHN: We threw him out.

493
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,267
You think we're cruel,
Detective,

494
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,238
but we'd already
Iost our son.

495
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,638
There was nothing else
we could do.

496
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,698
What about therapy?

497
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,108
Charlie refused to go.

498
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,476
He insisted that inside
he felt Iike a woman,

499
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,811
and nothing was
gonna change that.

500
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,544
God doesn't make mistakes.

501
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,245
We've got two younger sons
and a daughter.

502
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,288
Now, how could we explain
Charlie waxing his Iegs
and wearing makeup?

503
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,256
Mom?
Sarah, honey,
go to the kitchen.

504
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,757
We'II be done soon.

505
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:48,884
Okay.

506
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,923
How did Cheryl get along
with her siblings?

507
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,194
They stopped hanging
around with him

508
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,259
because they were getting
teased at school.

509
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,702
Well, how did Cheryl
do in school? Did she
ever have any fights...

510
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,205
Charlie!

511
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,570
His name is Charlie.

512
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,444
Was he ever violent,
Mr. Avery?

513
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,914
He beat a kid
with a baseball bat.
Put him in the hospital.

514
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,284
That violent enough?

515
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,195
Detective?

516
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,488
Sarah, right?

517
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,838
My parents are wrong.

518
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,209
You still talk to Cheryl?

519
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,647
Yes, but if my parents knew,
they'd kick me out, too.

520
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,176
Your parents said that
Cheryl once beat somebody
with a baseball bat.

521
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,450
She cut through the field
one day after school.

522
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,048
The baseball team
saw her and chased her.

523
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,252
She had to grab a bat
to defend herself.

524
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,556
This kind of thing
happen a Iot?

525
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:01,156
AII the time, I mean,
kids made fun of her
Iike she was a big joke.

526
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,962
Anybody ever hurt
her physically?

527
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,433
They beat
the hell out of her
whenever they could.

528
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,064
I mean, she had to
go to the hospital
three times for stitches.

529
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,538
I don't care
what anybody says,

530
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,099
she's the bravest
person I know.

531
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,675
I talked to her teachers.

532
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,909
A sympathetic one
suggested that she
transfer to Harvey Milk,

533
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,245
an alternative
public school

534
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,909
for gay and
trans-gendered kids.

535
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,044
So why didn't she go?

536
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,747
Because her parents
wouldn't Iet her.

537
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,084
Where are you
going with this?

538
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,750
AII I need to know
is whether or not
Cheryl's been violent.

539
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,226
Only in self-defense.

540
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,820
One time, two boys
held her up against

541
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,422
a wall and pulled
her pants down.

542
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,899
AIex, this girl has
been through hell.

543
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,334
I know she's been a victim
and I know she's suffered.

544
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,838
But that doesn't give Cheryl
the right to kill Joe Cappilla

545
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,033
for threatening
to expose her.

546
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,871
Then at Ieast
offer her a plea.

547
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,070
Not until I know her intent.

548
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,310
If Berger will agree
to a psych evaluation,

549
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,249
I'II have Huang
talk to Cheryl.

550
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,378
Yeah, when I was seven,
I knew I was different.

551
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,949
I mean,
every night I'd go to bed
dreaming about being a girl.

552
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,653
Well, how did
you handle that?

553
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,058
Forced myself to be a boy.

554
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,228
That must have been difficult.

555
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,292
Yeah, I played with GI Joes
when I wanted to
dress up Barbies.

556
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,503
When was the first time that
you tried to become a woman?
Can you remember?

557
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,066
Yeah, I was ten.

558
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,636
And my father caught me
putting on my mother's makeup.

559
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,039
And what did he do?

560
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:28,847
Well, he beat
the crap out of me and
he called me a pervert.

561
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,049
Did that change
your feelings any?

562
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,284
No.

563
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,025
It's not something
you can change.

564
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,860
I mean, it's... It's me.
It's how I feel.

565
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,492
And I can't be anything else,

566
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,162
but I wanted to be
a whole woman.

567
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,695
Sure.

568
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,908
And I needed the surgery.
Especially after I met Eddie.

569
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,601
Eddie.

570
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,937
Had you ever considered
telling him?

571
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,880
No, no.

572
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,119
I figured I'd Iose him.

573
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,418
I mean, Eddie was
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

574
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,893
I mean, he was the first man
that Ioved me as a woman.

575
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,627
And I figured
if I had the surgery,
I wouldn't have to tell him.

576
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,725
But Joe was gonna
tell him, right?

577
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,463
How did that make you feel?

578
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,139
I saw fists punching me
Iike all those times before.

579
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,735
Any time Cheryl's
been violent,

580
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,643
it's been in response
to a perceived threat.

581
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,909
Joe had stopped the attack
and was Ieaving the bathroom.

582
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,780
The threat was over.
Not in her mind.

583
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,513
She feared what those
drunken party-goers

584
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,020
would do to her when
she Ieft that bathroom.

585
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,680
Boy, you'd make a great
witness for the defense.

586
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,850
I'm just calling it
Iike I see it, AIex.

587
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,826
I don't think she
intended to kill Joe.

588
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,021
AII right.

589
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,926
If you're convinced,
I'II drop it to man one.

590
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,070
I told Cheryl
about your offer,

591
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,299
but she wants
to go to trial.

592
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,568
She does, or you do?

593
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,943
Do you know why
I became a Iawyer, AIex?

594
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,510
To see your face on TV?

595
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,781
To change society's
misconceptions
about what's normal.

596
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,150
I'm here for the underdog.

597
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,519
You're here for yourself.

598
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,818
No, I'm here for a cause.

599
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,757
Gender is not always binary.

600
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,692
People are afraid
of what they don't know.

601
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,990
Cheryl's case can change that.

602
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,190
Are you so sure of this

603
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,132
that you're willing to
serve up your client
as the sacrificial Iamb?

604
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,465
She could spend the rest
of her Iife in prison.

605
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,267
Not after this is tried in
the court of public opinion.

606
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:33,038
Joe Cappilla sexually
assaulted Cheryl Avery
and threatened to out her.

607
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,136
She fought back
to save her Iife.

608
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,448
She's not going to prison.

609
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:46,946
Hello.

610
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,384
Thanks for meeting me.

611
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,223
Well, I shouldn't be
speaking to you
without my attorney.

612
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,288
I shouldn't be
asking you to,

613
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,994
but I'm very concerned
about how Mr. Berger
is handling your case.

614
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,500
You're the one prosecuting me.
Why would you care?

615
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,701
Because I think you're
getting bad advice.

616
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,902
No, he's...

617
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,912
No, he's the only one
who's been on my side.

618
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,004
He knows what
I've been through.

619
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,105
Then he should be
the first one

620
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,310
to tell you that your chances
of acquittal are slim to none.

621
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,320
I was attacked
and almost raped, okay?

622
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,413
He says a jury
will take my side.

623
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,823
I think a jury is going
to have some trouble

624
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:25,090
separating the facts of
the case from who you are.

625
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,864
Well, if you're so sure
I'm going to Iose,
then why are you here?

626
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,198
Because I want to know
why you won't take the deal.

627
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:34,998
What deal?

628
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:41,238
I told Berger
I would plead down to
first-degree manslaughter.

629
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,174
He never told me.

630
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,677
You had no right to speak
to my client without me.

631
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,118
I'm taking this
to Judge Larsen

632
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,382
and the disciplinary
committee.

633
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,650
Go ahead.
They'II Iove the part

634
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,952
where you ignored
your obligation

635
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,287
to bring my deal
to your client

636
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,294
and then Iied to me
and told me you had.

637
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:01,025
I've done hundreds of trials
and made new case Iaw.

638
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,930
I think I know what's
best for my client.

639
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,434
Doesn't Cheryl have
a right to decide?

640
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,526
Fine.

641
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,231
Cheryl, I have your
best interests at heart.

642
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,002
Go ahead, take the deal
and you'II go to prison
for at Ieast five years.

643
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,702
And if you don't take the deal
and you get convicted,

644
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,974
you'II go for a minimum
of 15-to-Iife.

645
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,071
Well, do you think
we'II Iose?

646
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,139
You're not guilty, Cheryl.
Answer her question.

647
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,206
Look, she's trying
to scare you.

648
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,479
Yeah, there's a chance
you'II Iose,

649
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,918
but think of everything
you're going to gain.

650
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,785
He's trying to make you
a martyr for the cause.

651
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,884
I'II take the deal.

652
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,758
You're making
a big mistake.

653
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,167
STABLER: How'd it go in court?

654
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,535
Cheryl pled out.

655
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,904
You know that the only person
that came to support her
was her sister.

656
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:48,968
And you.

657
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,571
Yeah, but I'm not family.

658
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,740
Excuse me. Detective Benson.

659
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,547
Mr. Berger,
how can I help you?

660
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,520
Cheryl wants to talk
to you about her plea.

661
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,648
She needs to speak
to the A.D.A. about that.

662
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,454
My client's not a big fan
of Ms. Cabot.

663
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,585
Why not?

664
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,826
Well, Cheryl feels she was
tricked into pleading out.

665
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,558
Well, why does she
want to talk to me?

666
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,158
She thinks you'II
understand the situation.

667
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,931
What situation?

668
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,528
Her accommodations.

669
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,508
Look, you have to help me,
I cannot stay here.

670
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,274
Cheryl, you pled guilty.

671
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,543
You knew that you
were going to prison.
I'm a woman,

672
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,085
and they put me
in a cell with men.

673
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,643
You didn't tell her?

674
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,189
I told her to go to trial.

675
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,246
Bull!

676
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,293
You set her up
for your own career.

677
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,794
What, the murder case
wasn't enough for you?

678
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,830
The civil rights issue
is more pressing.

679
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,922
Oh, and you're
going to ride it

680
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,398
all the way to the
Supreme Court, aren't you?

681
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,128
Why not? This could be
a precedent-setting case.

682
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,067
Yeah, not to mention
a juicy story.

683
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,698
A woman in a man's prison?
You'II have the media
drooling!

684
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,040
I'm sorry.

685
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,412
Just help me.

686
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,514
My hands are tied.
I can't move Cheryl
to a women's prison.

687
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,849
She was going
to have surgery.

688
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,049
Unfortunately, she's still
anatomically male.

689
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,489
New York State
determines a person's

690
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,890
gender based
on their genitals,
not their feelings.

691
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,121
So you're not going
to do anything?

692
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,958
There's nothing I can do.

693
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,022
The Iaw says she's not
entitled to special treatment,

694
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,226
and I can't put a man
in a women's prison.

695
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,668
But Cheryl is not
a man anymore.

696
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,797
Legally, she still is.

697
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,434
Look, Berger has to
fight it out with the
Department of Corrections

698
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,241
and I have to
make an appearance.
I will see what I can do.

699
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,751
BERGER: Cheryl Avery
is a woman.

700
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,616
The State of New York
doesn't see it that way.

701
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,782
The medical community
would side with the defendant
in the matter of her gender.

702
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,757
This hearing is not about
the politics of gender.

703
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:42,850
It's about where to house him.

704
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:47,227
It's extremely derogatory
to refer to my client
using male pronouns.

705
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,665
You have my sincere apology,
but biologically,
your client is a man.

706
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:54,227
My client will be
singled out for abuse
in a male facility.

707
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,863
Not if she stops
taking hormones.

708
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,933
Federal prison guidelines
state the pre-established
hormone Ievels

709
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,138
of transsexuals
must be maintained.

710
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,680
When prescribed
by a physician.

711
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:04,976
Your client was
self-medicating

712
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,448
with a friend's
birth control pills.

713
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,645
Look, I'd rather die
than stop hormone therapy.

714
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,120
What about protective custody?

715
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:15,125
Twenty-three hours a day
without human contact.

716
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,592
That's cruel and unusual.

717
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,459
I'm generously giving
your client the choice.

718
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,989
Either stop the hormones
or go into protective custody.

719
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,630
There's nothing else
you can do?

720
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,633
The defendant has not yet
been sentenced, Your Honor.

721
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,805
AII right.

722
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,280
Then ask Judge Larsen
to vacate the guilty plea.

723
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,950
Take this to trial.
Hope for an acquittal.

724
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,185
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

725
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,390
What's this I hear about you
wanting off the Avery case?

726
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,553
I just don't think
I'm the right person
to try it.

727
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,893
That's not what I heard.

728
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,398
You've made
several impassioned

729
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:59,459
arguments on her behalf.
Perhaps you'd Iike to
defend her instead.

730
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,164
Well, she could use
better representation

731
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,537
than that self-serving
snake Berger.

732
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,975
Reptile though he may be,
Morty Berger's
a damn good attorney.

733
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,036
He deserves
a worthy adversary.

734
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,978
I think I'm more
sympathetic to Cheryl

735
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,812
than a prosecutor should be.

736
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,081
A good A.D.A. has to think
on both sides of the fence.

737
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,987
Your empathy is a strength,
not a weakness.

738
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,752
You know, if Cheryl
had been born a woman,

739
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,317
a jury would have
no problem acquitting her.

740
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,794
She killed a man.

741
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,296
What do you care
what sex she is?

742
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,992
Because that,
and not the evidence,

743
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,261
is what's going
to convict her.

744
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,596
No, what's going
to convict her

745
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,398
is a jury of her peers,

746
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,235
not angels or
divine ethical beings.

747
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,176
I suppose it bothers me
more than it should.

748
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,015
Well, I'II reassign the case
if you Iike.

749
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,886
But you might
want to consider,

750
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:53,048
who's gonna give Cheryl Avery
the fairest treatment?

751
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,855
You or some other
prosecutor who'II put
her gender on trial?

752
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,391
PSYCHIATRIST:
Gender identity dysphoria

753
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,802
occurs when a woman feels
trapped in a man's body.

754
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,035
These feelings are centered
in the hypothalamus gland
in the brain.

755
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,703
Specifically,
the stria terminalis.

756
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,246
PIease describe
the exhibits, Doctor.

757
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,875
The first photo is
the stria terminalis
of a male brain.

758
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,816
The second is that
of a female.

759
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,879
The stria terminalis
of the male brain is much
Iarger than the female's.

760
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,825
BERGER: The third appears
to be the same size as
the female stria terminalis.

761
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,192
It is, but it's actually
the stria terminalis

762
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,164
of a biological male
who is transsexual.

763
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,167
Are you saying, Doctor,

764
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:42,969
that despite being
born with male genitals,
a portion of this man's brain

765
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,065
is identical to a woman's?

766
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,435
Yes.

767
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,809
And in your expert opinion,

768
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,508
explain what this means
in Cheryl's case.

769
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:56,986
Cheryl feels Iike a woman
because her brain is
physiologically female.

770
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,213
Thank you, Doctor.

771
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,254
Referring to the defense's
Exhibit Three,

772
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,890
the stria terminalis
of a male-to-female
transsexual.

773
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,200
Is that a picture of
the defendant's brain?
PSYCHIATRIST: No.

774
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,363
These are photographs
of cadaver brains.

775
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,702
Why didn't you photograph
Cheryl Avery's brain?

776
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,834
The stria terminalis is only
accessible post mortem.

777
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:23,778
So as far as you know
Cheryl's stria terminalis
is the size of a man's

778
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,940
and she's not a transsexual.

779
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,040
Object, Your Honor.

780
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,018
LARSEN: Overruled.
Answer the question, Doctor.

781
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,012
I can't respond with
certainty either way.

782
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,319
Nothing further.

783
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,120
Let's talk about
the first time

784
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,861
you were assaulted
for dressing as a woman.

785
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,097
How old were you?

786
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,229
Twelve.

787
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,674
And what happened?

788
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,039
I was in

789
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,036
my room wearing
my mom's bra and skirt

790
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,842
when my brother's
friend walked in.

791
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,446
What did he do?

792
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,643
He Iaughed.

793
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,947
And he said he would
tell everyone.

794
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,147
Did he?

795
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,615
Yeah.

796
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,453
In fact,
the next day at school

797
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,257
three boys came
in the bathroom

798
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,925
and they hit me
and they kicked me,

799
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,592
and spit on me.

800
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,102
How many times
have you been assaulted?

801
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:24,335
I've had my nose broken
and my shoulder dislocated

802
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,900
and once someone
set fire to my hair.

803
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:34,250
Cheryl, how have these
repeated attacks affected you?

804
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,649
I was scared to
Ieave the house.

805
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:41,523
But I had no choice when
my parents kicked me out.

806
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,061
And every time someone
Iooked at me, I wondered,

807
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,692
"Are they going to hurt me?
Are they going to...

808
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,969
"Is this going to be the time
that someone kills me?"

809
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,367
When Joe Cappilla
assaulted you,

810
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,434
this is what
you were feeling?

811
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,570
Yes.

812
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,952
Your witness, Ms. Cabot.

813
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,816
So you thought your Iife
was in danger that night?

814
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,618
Yes.

815
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,198
Did anybody at the party
threaten you?

816
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,393
No, no.

817
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,295
Did anyone make
derogatory remarks
about transsexuals?

818
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,206
No, but why would they?
Nobody knew.

819
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,540
Had anyone at the party
ever hurt you before?

820
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,809
No. The only people
I knew there

821
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,009
were Joe and Eddie.

822
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,113
How Iong had you
been dating Eddie?

823
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,189
Two months.

824
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,387
Were you intimate?

825
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,255
Yeah.

826
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,896
We kissed and fooled around,
but we never had sex.

827
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,033
Why not?

828
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,005
Because I didn't want
Eddie to know

829
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,507
I hadn't had my surgery yet.

830
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,933
So you deceived him.

831
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,569
I had to.

832
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,810
What do you think
Eddie would have done
if he'd found out the truth?

833
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,216
I don't know.
Don't you?

834
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:20,951
You told Detective Benson
that you were afraid Eddie
was going to Ieave you.

835
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,357
In fact,
Eddie committed suicide
when he found out.

836
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,191
And I blame myself for that.

837
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,163
Do you blame yourself
for Joe's death?

838
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,064
I was protecting myself.

839
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,332
AII I wanted to do was
hit him over the head.

840
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:40,343
If you hadn't killed him,
he would have told everyone
your secret when he came to.

841
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,669
Well, I wasn't thinking
that far ahead.

842
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,180
Weren't you?

843
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,981
Joe was going to tell Eddie,
and you couldn't
take that chance.

844
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,520
You were finally happy.
Eddie Ioved you.

845
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,216
Well, Joe was gonna ruin that.

846
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,951
He was gonna ruin it,

847
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,754
and I couldn't Iet him do it.

848
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,625
I could not Iet him do it.
I had to stop him.

849
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,997
You did.

850
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,602
Nothing further.

851
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,316
Has the jury
reached the verdict?

852
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,545
We have, Your Honor.

853
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,986
LARSEN: Will the defendant
please rise?

854
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,561
On the sole count of murder
in the second degree,
how does the jury find?

855
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,898
We find the defendant

856
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,023
guilty.

857
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:40,931
PIease, please,
don't do this!

858
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,405
PIease, you can't
put me in that place!

859
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,534
PIease, help me, please.

860
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,272
Somebody! You can't
put me in that place!

861
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,245
Hey.

862
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,616
I'm heading out.
You want to grab a drink?

863
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,592
Thank you. But, you know,
I am just not in the mood.

864
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:07,290
Well, neither am I,
but I don't feel much
Iike going home.

865
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,564
Do you think I pushed
Cheryl too hard?

866
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,667
You did your job.

867
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,234
Then why do I feel so Iousy?

868
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,710
Because you Iook at Cheryl,

869
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:30,147
and you can't imagine
what it's Iike to feel that
your own body is a mistake.

870
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,015
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

871
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,686
Benson.

872
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,592
We'II be right there.

873
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,522
What's up?

874
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,826
I gotta go to Bellevue.
You should come with me.

875
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,967
Special Victims Unit,
you called about
a rape victim.

876
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,670
They are taking him up
to surgery now.

877
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,007
CABOT: What happened?

878
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,346
Cheryl Avery was
gang-raped at Rikers.
