1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,164
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:06,933
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,065
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,076
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,671
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,739
These are their stories.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,951
She's the COO now.
You need to
watch your ass.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,386
If Amanda wants to fire me,
not much I can do about it.

9
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,547
Fight back, Mark.

10
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,090
She humiliates you
in front of everybody,

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,058
treats you Iike her
personal assistant.

12
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,424
File a complaint
with Human Resources.

13
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,429
And I'II still be
out of a job.

14
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,528
I'm serious.

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,561
Hey, what the hell
happened here?

16
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,698
You smell that?

17
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,470
Yeah.
It's Iike a urinal.

18
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,670
Is that
what I think it is?

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,880
(MOANING)

20
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,283
Oh, my God! It's Amanda.

21
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,588
Who did this to you?

22
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,897
Perineal bruising
and tearing

23
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,160
from rape and sodomy.

24
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,862
Friction burns
around the neck,
wrist and ankles,

25
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,997
and a scalp Iaceration
from being struck
with a sharp object.

26
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,666
The wound's deep
but not serious.

27
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,766
Any fluids present?

28
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,777
No, he wore condoms.

29
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,608
Your Iab should find
Iubricant in the specimen.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,704
She say anything?

31
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,271
Not to me.

32
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,647
But maybe the other officers
will have her statement now.

33
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,276
It's Exam Room 3.

34
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,843
WOMAN: You have
the right to an attorney.

35
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,219
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

36
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,190
Detective Stabler, SVU.
What's going on?

37
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,282
FBI.

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,224
This is a rape victim
in our jurisdiction.

39
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,422
Not our concern.
At the moment,
she's under arrest.

40
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,589
Ms. Curry,
do you understand
your rights

41
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,689
as I've read them
to you?

42
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,994
Why are you guys
doing this to me?

43
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,466
I was attacked
and raped.

44
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,435
Do you understand
your rights?

45
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,528
Yes.

46
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,232
Look, we have to get
Ms. Curry's statement.

47
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,605
There's a rapist out there.
We'd Iike to get
a description.

48
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,802
You can do that
in federal Iockup,

49
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,208
but it's gonna take
a while to process her.

50
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,540
What are the charges?

51
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,637
Securities fraud,

52
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,114
violating interstate
and international
banking Iaws,

53
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,515
money Iaundering
for a criminal enterprise

54
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,917
and tax evasion.

55
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,367
Where the hell's our witness?

56
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,464
You know how
the Feds are.

57
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,635
They just Iove to flex
their muscles.

58
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,268
They usually work with us,
so why the stall?

59
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,176
CLAUDIA: Where are they?
MAN: Lockup Two.

60
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,272
I think we're about
to find out.

61
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,442
Assistant US Attorney
CIaudia Williams.

62
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,985
My apologies for the delay.

63
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,042
Where's Ms. Curry?

64
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,247
Outside.

65
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,949
I wanted to
talk to you first.

66
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,049
You cannot interrogate
the prisoner

67
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,286
about the federal case
against her

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,554
or anything
relating to it.

69
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,323
Well, what if her
criminal affiliations

70
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,921
directly relate
to the attack?

71
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,364
Well, if Ms. Curry's
business associates
were involved,

72
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,526
she'd be in the morgue.

73
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,933
Money Iaundering's
a RICO charge.

74
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,334
So she's in bed
with organized crime.

75
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,566
We talking LCN
or the Russians?

76
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,198
Stop fishing,
Detective Stabler.

77
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,369
Well, if you'd just
share a Iittle bit,
I wouldn't have to.

78
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,639
There's too much at stake.

79
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,045
We're not interested
in your case.

80
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,309
We're trying to find
a rapist,

81
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,578
but we can't do that
if you obstruct justice.

82
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,452
Well, until you file a 61,
I'm not obstructing anything.

83
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:47,254
And unless I allow you access,
you won't be able to do that.

84
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,252
So, what's it gonna be?

85
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,889
Oh, I guess
we'II just bend over.

86
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,890
I'II be right outside.

87
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,231
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

88
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,897
Thanks a Iot. Ms. Curry,
have a seat please.

89
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,344
Where should I start?

90
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,437
BENSON:
Well, why don't you start

91
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,982
by taking us
through your day?

92
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,486
Gym, work, Iunch,
work, meeting, work.

93
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,748
Where do you
work out?

94
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,687
It's called Workout Studio.

95
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,349
Couple of blocks
from the office.

96
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,915
Did you go out
for Iunch?

97
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,518
No, I ate at my desk.

98
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,584
Delivered?

99
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,255
My assistant
went out and got it.

100
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,094
When were you attacked?

101
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,861
Around 11:00.

102
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,335
I was in my office
crunching the next
quarter projections

103
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,496
for an emergency meeting.

104
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,472
Anybody else around?

105
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,973
Everyone Ieft
hours before.

106
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,508
That's why when I
heard the noise,
I went Iooking.

107
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,707
But as soon as I
opened up my door,

108
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,979
this man rushed me,
and after that,
it was Iights out.

109
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,542
Can you describe him?

110
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,454
Not really.
I just got a glimpse.

111
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,322
White, average height.

112
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,761
Any distinguishing marks?
Anything you can remember?

113
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,854
No.

114
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,060
Did he say anything?
Yeah.

115
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,339
That it was payback.

116
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,432
I thought he was
going to kill me.

117
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,670
Okay, is it possible that

118
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,606
the people you're accused
of working for

119
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,241
might have been trying
to send you a message?

120
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,148
Could be.

121
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,812
They're brutal, vicious men.

122
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,413
But they don't make a move
without Sergei's say so.

123
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,479
He would've cut my throat...

124
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,186
That's enough.
Get her out of there.

125
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,499
Good news is
we got enough urine
to test.

126
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,302
If we're Iucky,
there'II be some
DNA in it.

127
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,070
Perp gave her
a golden shower?

128
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,542
Rape took place on the table.

129
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,135
Found footprints
where he stood
over her.

130
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,272
Making the
humiliation complete.
Yeah.

131
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,715
The bad news is
there's too many prints
and fibers.

132
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:52,910
This kind
of building security,

133
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,179
maybe our perp
actually works here.

134
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,311
Or pretended to.

135
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,582
We found a
cleaning crew jumpsuit

136
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,987
stuffed under
the reception desk.

137
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,457
What company?
Atlas.

138
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,160
The great thing about
criminals, no matter how
smart they think they are,

139
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,665
they're not
smarter than me.

140
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,100
You found traces
of seminal fluid.
Not a drop.

141
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,693
But we did find
a few short and curlies

142
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,829
that didn't belong
to the victim.

143
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,395
Okay, so we got DNA.

144
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,305
Matching two
other rape cases,

145
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,604
both in Brooklyn.

146
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,872
AIso, your perp suffers
from diabetes.

147
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,038
How do you know that?

148
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,708
We found glucose
but no ketones in the urine.

149
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,411
I'd say he's
a middle-aged onset diabetic

150
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,748
who's not taking his meds

151
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,980
or doesn't know
that he's sick.

152
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,181
Based on what?

153
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,814
The Ievel of sugar's
pretty high,

154
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,620
and juvenile diabetics
Iearn early on

155
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,320
that if they forget
an insulin injection,

156
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,158
it can prove fatal.

157
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,755
Our serial rapist
started with two
Brooklyn targets.

158
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,130
The first victim,
Petra Ivankov,

159
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,998
was raped six months ago.

160
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,970
Worked as a stripper
at the Volga CIub,

161
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,029
a known front
for the Russian mob.

162
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,337
Mob boss
Sergei Perlman's girlfriend.

163
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,106
She got smoked
after talking to Brooklyn SVU
about her rape.

164
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,613
They were probably
scared she was gonna
slip pillow talk.

165
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,117
Number two is Perlman's
baby sister, Tatiana.

166
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,676
She died of uterine cancer
three months ago.

167
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,517
BIitz attacked
after a chemo treatment.

168
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,613
Took a pretty bad beating.

169
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,057
Our guy is definitely
Iosing control
and escalating.

170
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,687
Our victim, Amanda Curry,
raped, beaten and sodomized.

171
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,060
What did Brooklyn say

172
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,395
about the Russian connection
between their two victims?

173
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,230
I mean,
why choose these women

174
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,860
if not trying to get
at Perlman somehow?

175
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,926
Did they even
talk to this guy?

176
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,666
Organized Crime Bureau
shut them down.

177
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,729
Wouldn't Iet them near him.

178
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,400
Completely stalled
their investigation.

179
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,808
Sergei's a major player.
If we're Iooking
for someone with a grudge,

180
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,936
it's gonna be a Iong Iist.

181
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,038
What about physical evidence
other than the DNA?

182
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,946
The Iab's still working
on print elimination.

183
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,814
But they found a discarded
cleaning crew jumpsuit

184
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,352
from Atlas Janitorial.

185
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,888
The supervisor mentioned
a car blocking
the service entrance,

186
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,981
so we checked
the outside cameras.

187
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,923
The way
they were positioned,
you can't see much.

188
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,393
AII we saw was
a Iate model Ford Focus,
Jersey tags.

189
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,192
We can only make out "JLQ."

190
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,561
What about
cameras inside?

191
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,259
Well, they're in
the stairwells
and they're outside,

192
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,700
so female employees
feel safe working Iate.

193
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,431
I say we check out
the Russian angle.

194
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,972
Knock on a few doors
in Brighton Beach,

195
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,132
see what shakes Ioose.

196
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,334
Well, the Feds
will be all over us

197
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,706
before we ask
the first question.

198
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,210
Well, we do have a job to do.

199
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,679
Before we declare war,
there is another connection.

200
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,181
Both our victim
and the stripper

201
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,740
belonged to the same gym.

202
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,786
Workout Studio
was Iisted in her file.

203
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,446
What about Perlman's sister?

204
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,853
Well, nothing was
in her file.

205
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:11,912
Brooklyn probably
didn't ask

206
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,255
because she
was dying of cancer.

207
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,526
Okay, here it is.

208
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,089
AII three women
had recent memberships.

209
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,794
We had sent out
a promotional mailer

210
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,497
to businesses
and Iocal residents.

211
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,902
What's all this about?

212
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,873
An assault.
You're kidding.

213
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,966
When did they start
their memberships?

214
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,873
(SIGHING)

215
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,643
Within the Iast
year-and-a-half.

216
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,114
BENSON: They know each other?
They work out together?

217
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,117
I never saw them
with each other.

218
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,652
We're gonna need a Iist
of all your members

219
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,381
and all your male employees.

220
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,047
We have about
500 members

221
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,023
and just 10
on full-time staff.

222
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,357
Who owns the club?
My father.

223
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,255
You have any employees
40 years or older?

224
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,766
Just my dad.
Everyone else is under 30.

225
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,427
STABLER: What capacity
does he work in?

226
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,527
I run the place.

227
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,764
Dad just Iooks
over the books.

228
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,067
Makes sure we have
what we need.

229
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,404
How often does he
come in here?

230
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,808
Wait a second.
Dad doesn't interact
with our clients.

231
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,004
He wouldn't even know them.

232
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,071
What kind of car
does he drive?
A Focus.

233
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,317
PIate's a match.

234
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,547
Still not enough
for a warrant.

235
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,317
I'm Peter Sipes.
My son called.

236
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,824
He tells me
you have questions.

237
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,052
Mr. Sipes, if it's
all right with you,

238
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,856
we'd Iike to do this
down at our precinct.

239
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,159
Am I under arrest?
Not yet.

240
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,991
I can assure you
I didn't assault anyone.

241
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,729
Then you got
nothing to worry about.

242
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,895
(PETER SIGHING)

243
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,837
I don't see why you had to
drag me down here for this.

244
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,965
I've done nothing wrong.

245
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,206
Gregory.
It's Mike from LA.
I thought you were dead.

246
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,871
You're drunk.
I don't know you.

247
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,143
I swear, you got
a twin out there,
you know that?

248
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,444
Take it easy.

249
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,047
Can I get you
something to drink?

250
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,680
Soda, if you have it.

251
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,419
I thought you diabetics
had to control
your sugar intake.

252
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,654
Maybe you'd Iike some water?

253
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,925
I don't know what
you're talking about.

254
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,989
Where were you
the night before Iast?

255
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,227
At my job.

256
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,666
I'm the shift supervisor
at a packaging plant
in East Orange.

257
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,070
So you own a gym
and you work?

258
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,335
Well, it's not a chain
Iike Bally's, Detective.

259
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,400
What shift do you work?

260
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,605
I work from 10:00 p.m.
to 6:00 a.m.

261
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,773
You drive to work?

262
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,817
What's this
really about?

263
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,215
Rape, Mr. Sipes.

264
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,518
I did not rape anybody.

265
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,116
Then you'II be willing
to Iet us take a mouth swab.

266
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,457
Make this
whole thing go away.

267
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,597
You want my DNA,
you're gonna have
to get a warrant.

268
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,728
We don't have
enough for a judge,

269
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,533
but I don't want to cut
this guy Ioose.

270
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,664
Let's do a voice Iineup.

271
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,572
I'II keep the suspect
on ice until then.

272
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,304
Well, we know how well
those hold up in court.

273
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,402
Well, it doesn't matter.

274
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,743
Amanda Curry
picks this guy's voice
out of the six,

275
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,940
we got enough for a warrant.

276
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,381
The AUSA
is not gonna Iet us

277
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,577
just take her prisoner
for a ride.

278
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,883
I'II have Cabot
pave the way.

279
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,054
Sorry. Amanda Curry's
not here.

280
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,095
She get transferred
to another facility?

281
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,527
Nope.

282
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,428
Does it say where she is?

283
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,194
I don't even know
who she is.

284
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,199
There is no record
of an Amanda Curry
in the system.

285
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,966
But that's impossible.
We interviewed her
in that cell yesterday.

286
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,031
I don't know who
the hell you talked to,

287
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,407
but no one was processed
through here by that name.

288
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,343
She's gone.

289
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,909
Metropolitan Correctional
claims they never
even heard of her.

290
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,751
I got a call from
the US Attorney's office
with assurances.

291
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,915
As soon as we
make an arrest,

292
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,583
they will produce
Amanda Curry for trial.

293
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,751
How are we supposed to do that

294
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,419
without the cooperation
of our complaining witness?

295
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,055
We ran the rape suspect's
prints off the coffee mug.

296
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,429
We got zip.
No arrests, no record.

297
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,594
So we checked
the property rolls,
the tax rolls, city permits.

298
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,932
Seems that Peter and his son

299
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,303
have consecutive
Social Security numbers.

300
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,171
How's that possible?
A few years back,

301
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,834
a couple got
pinched in Delaware

302
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,037
for running a stock scam.

303
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,977
The entire family
had consecutive numbers.

304
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,880
They'd been relocated
in the Witness
Protection Program.

305
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,008
It's gotta be WITSEC.

306
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,416
That's run by US Marshals,

307
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,047
which would explain
the US Attorney's
interest in this case.

308
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,819
There was a drunk
cuffed out in the corridor.

309
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,019
He recognized our suspect.
He called him Gregory.

310
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,222
And then he just waves it off
Iike it was an honest mistake.

311
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,731
We should talk to him.
Find out who Peter really is.

312
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,064
We do that, we'II blow
a protected witness's cover.

313
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,866
AII right, you and Munch
sit this drunk down,

314
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,534
and after that,
put him in our holding pen
for the duration.

315
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,701
Who we Iooking for?

316
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,108
I'II go ask
the desk sergeant.

317
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,669
You know, if our rapist
is a protected witness

318
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,010
how are we gonna
get around the Feds?

319
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,140
We won't have to.

320
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,549
You commit a crime
in the program,
you go to prison.

321
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,019
Sammy the Bull
is serving 15
for dealing drugs.

322
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,385
We'II check Peter's alibi,

323
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,287
see if he
was working his shift,

324
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,689
but he's still testifying,

325
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,058
they're not gonna
hand him over.

326
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,797
FIN: Michael Kerring, get up.
You got company.

327
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,163
Whatever it is,
I didn't do it.

328
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,826
You have an interesting
résumé, Michael.

329
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,370
Shoplifting,
a few B and E's
and purse snatching.

330
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,462
I'm not very good at it

331
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,097
or I wouldn't keep
getting pinched.

332
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,075
So I know I can't help you.

333
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,873
What do you guys
do here, anyway?

334
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,743
We catch rapists,
pedophiles
and murderers.

335
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,715
Damn.

336
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,083
Well, in that case,
I can honestly say

337
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,054
that whatever it is,
I didn't do it.

338
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,282
I am no short eyes.

339
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,825
I have never touched a woman
that I didn't have to pay for.

340
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,917
SIow your roll, moron.

341
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,087
We're just Iooking
for some background.

342
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,528
We brought a guy
in on a rape beef,

343
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,588
and we're told
you were friends.

344
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,430
Turns out he's got
a couple of aliases
we want to check.

345
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,565
I don't know
anybody Iike that.

346
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,802
You saw him right
out there in the hallway.
You called him Gregory.

347
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,001
I was drunk.

348
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,306
It couldn't have been him.
He's been dead for years.

349
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,313
MUNCH: Who's dead?
Gregory.

350
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,348
Rossovitch.

351
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,350
He used to run
with some serious hitters,
in way over his head.

352
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,718
Who did he run with?

353
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,916
Russians in West Hollywood.

354
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,459
Pulling gas tax,
Medicaid fraud,

355
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,927
shipping bootleg vodka,
kidnapping, the whole nine.

356
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,021
If he was that big time,
how'd you know him?

357
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,588
I used to be a gas jockey.

358
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,534
They put me in charge
of pumping hijacked diesel.

359
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,070
How'd he die?

360
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,768
Car bomb.

361
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,572
Was that really him?

362
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,146
Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

363
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,807
FIN: What's the problem?

364
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,214
They put a heavy contract
out on Gregory.

365
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,654
You open this up,
you're asking for trouble.

366
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,385
Why'd they want him dead?

367
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,451
I heard
he was spilling his guts
to the Feds.

368
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,258
Bodies were dropping
all over the place.

369
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,026
Friends, business associates.

370
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,124
They even killed his parents.

371
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,761
That's when I moved East.

372
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,998
Guess I didn't go far enough.

373
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,035
BENSON: Looks Iike
we're too Iate.

374
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,082
Hi. Lynn Moody.
You folks interested
in seeing the house?

375
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,084
Actually we're interested
in the whereabouts
of the owner.

376
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,017
Oh. That I can't tell you.

377
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,783
I only got the Iisting
Iast night.

378
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:51,914
Who hired you?

379
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,253
CIaudia Williams.

380
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,850
When I got here,
there was a moving crew
in overdrive.

381
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,953
CIeaned the entire house out
in under four hours.

382
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,396
I've never seen
anything Iike it.

383
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,704
I don't suppose
I can convince you
to Iet me do the talking?

384
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:08,967
What's there
to talk about?

385
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,804
Either the AUSA
hands over our suspect

386
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,741
or she goes to jail
for obstruction.

387
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,608
We want her cooperation.

388
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,841
Peter wasn't at work
the night of the rape.

389
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,508
We've got a warrant
for his blood.

390
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,142
What else do we need?

391
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,914
You can go in now.

392
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,653
Thank you for taking
the time to see us,
Ms. Williams.

393
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,591
CIaudia. How can I help you?

394
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,095
Tell us the whereabouts
of Peter Sipes,

395
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,563
we'II get out of your hair.

396
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,793
No.
What do you mean, no?

397
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,460
You're harboring
a rapist, Counselor,

398
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,902
and using federal tax dollars
to do it.

399
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:44,102
Was there a trial
that I don't know about,
Detective Stabler?

400
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,906
We have a warrant
for Peter Sipes' blood,

401
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,140
duly signed by
a superior court judge.

402
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,646
I'II have it drawn
and delivered to your Iab.

403
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,845
Is that amenable?

404
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,615
The evidentiary chain
has to be followed.

405
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,281
We draw the blood, not you.

406
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,847
Now we're splitting hairs.

407
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,520
Is Gregory Rossovitch,
aka Peter Sipes, that
important to your case

408
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,961
that you're willing
to Iet him skate
on three class B felonies?

409
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,864
CLAUDIA: The DOJ
does not condone
criminal behavior.

410
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,561
Okay. Then why'd you move him?

411
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,070
Because he told us
he was recognized

412
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,765
by someone in your precinct.

413
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,965
Most of what
we now know about the mob

414
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,634
comes from Peter's testimony,

415
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,474
and he is an invaluable asset,

416
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,343
and we will protect him
at all costs.

417
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,905
At the expense of three women
who were raped and brutalized

418
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,043
by the man
that you are now shielding
from justice.

419
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,711
If he did do that,
he will go to prison,

420
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,051
but I think you have
the wrong man.

421
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,988
Where's Amanda Curry?

422
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,089
Unavailable to you.

423
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,721
How is she connected
to Peter Sipes?

424
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,592
AII of the victims
Iead back to the Russian mob.

425
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,067
Do you really think
that's a coincidence?

426
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:48,300
What is Peter's motive?
Why would he rape
these women?

427
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,832
You can tell by
the extent of the damage
that he's escalating.

428
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,434
Does somebody have to die
for you to care?

429
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,707
I know what you're up against.

430
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,444
But if, for one second,
I thought that my witness
was responsible,

431
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,042
I'd turn him over.

432
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,281
Why are you
protecting this guy?

433
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,218
Two hundred
and fifty-seven murders,

434
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,389
all ordered
by Sergei Perlman.

435
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,894
Policemen, businessmen,

436
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,028
because they wouldn't
pay extortion.

437
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,537
Even children,
butchered for fear

438
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,632
they might grow up
and seek revenge.

439
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,801
We've solved almost half,

440
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,368
and we've connected
California to New York

441
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,879
through Peter Sipes.

442
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,914
Does that answer
your question?

443
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,986
Can she really stop us?

444
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,583
No, but she can slow us down.

445
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,922
Hinder our investigation.

446
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,964
You know, I don't care
who that woman works for.
We can't Iet her do that.

447
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,931
CIaudia Williams
is doing her job.

448
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,729
She has an obligation
to protect her witnesses.

449
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,565
We have an obligation
to protect innocent women.

450
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,434
So whose side of the fence
you gonna sit on?

451
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,065
You seem awfully sure
Peter Sipes is guilty.

452
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,733
What are we
supposed to think?

453
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,574
It can't be easy
Iosing your identity,
starting over.

454
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,671
These people
cost him his past,

455
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,010
they're threatening
his survival.

456
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,072
I'm just not so sure

457
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,879
he would jeopardize
his Iast Iine of defense

458
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,544
against the very people
who want him dead.

459
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,349
What you're saying is
then that organized crime

460
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,946
takes precedence
over rape.

461
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,548
Arguments can be made
for both.

462
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,922
AIex, we don't have
that Iuxury.

463
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,722
We're working with
a serial rapist here.

464
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,992
And the next woman,
I'm telling you,
he's gonna kill her.

465
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,324
I will file a habeas
in the morning.

466
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,097
If CIaudia Williams
cannot produce the body,

467
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,968
the judge is going to
find her in contempt.

468
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,536
CABOT: The People request
habeas corpus, Your Honor.

469
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,773
A warrant was issued
for a blood sample
for a rape suspect

470
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,543
who is a federally
protected witness.

471
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,708
He has been made unavailable

472
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,445
by the United States
Attorney's office.

473
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,046
I made an offer
to have the blood drawn
by the FBI Iab

474
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,590
and delivered to the police.

475
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,988
The case isn't federal.

476
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,219
It falls under
the jurisdiction

477
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,124
of the city and county
of New York.

478
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,028
Special circumstances.
Our witness was recognized.

479
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,258
Objection.

480
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,767
Peter Sipes is a suspect
in three brutal rapes.

481
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:57,893
He is not a witness.

482
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,406
Nevertheless, he was spotted
at a Iocal precinct
by a former acquaintance

483
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,464
and had to be
moved immediately.

484
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,874
How can we settle
this amicably?

485
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,674
The AUSA is in contempt
of state Iaw, Your Honor.

486
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,975
Either she produces
the suspect

487
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,915
or she should sit in a cell
until she does.

488
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,953
She's made an excellent point.

489
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,851
Why shouldn't I give her
what she wants, CIaudia?

490
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,824
You know what I'm up against.
Perlman has eyes everywhere.

491
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,623
I have made every
effort to cooperate.

492
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,323
I mean, what difference
does it make
who takes the blood?

493
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,992
Chain of evidence.
How can we be sure
it's the suspect's

494
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,500
unless we actually draw it?

495
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,036
Objection.

496
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,696
I'm offended
by the implication.

497
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,932
Who else
would the blood come from?

498
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,634
Mistakes are made
all the time.

499
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,869
If that's true,
then I'm more inclined

500
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,809
to trust a federal
Iab facility

501
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,473
with greater resources
than your own.

502
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,318
Four vials of O negative
belonging to Peter Sipes,
as promised.

503
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,018
Yeah, and how can we be sure
this isn't your blood?

504
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,390
Signed affidavits
by the FBI Iab technicians

505
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,554
stating Iocation,
time and subject.

506
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,258
Or will you argue
conspiracy now?

507
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,733
No, I'm hoping
you just bend the Iaw

508
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,269
and don't actually break it.

509
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,497
I had the blood tested.

510
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,540
I wanted to make sure
that my trust
was not misplaced.

511
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,733
And what did you find?

512
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,708
I included the Iab report
with the affidavits.

513
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,369
I figured you'd want
to test it yourself.

514
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,208
Don't try to tell us
the DNA doesn't match.

515
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,474
Fine, but Peter Sipes
is cleared,

516
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,608
and you still have
a rapist out there.

517
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,187
Does our Iab report
match the FBI results?

518
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,384
Yes, it does.

519
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,120
Peter Sipes is innocent.

520
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,856
But his Y-chromosome
matches the DNA
in the rape kit.

521
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,022
Which means one thing.

522
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,623
His son, Gavin Sipes,
is our rapist.

523
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,636
Well, this time the AUSA
should turn him over
without a fight.

524
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,672
I don't think
she'd do anything
without one.

525
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,934
Gavin Sipes
is a protected witness
by default

526
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,305
because of his
father's testimony.

527
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,777
Just go reason
with Ms. Williams
and close this file.

528
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,282
And if that doesn't work?
Arrest her.

529
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,448
What do you want now?

530
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,750
Your office said
you'd be here.
What happened?

531
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,688
Well, as far
as I can tell,
a recent immigrant

532
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,625
refused to pay
her protection fee.

533
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,218
There are two bodies.

534
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,923
Innocent bystander.

535
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,296
You can see now
what I'm up against.

536
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,698
So what do you need?

537
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,792
Gavin Sipes.

538
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:11,961
You sure?

539
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,834
DNA doesn't Iie.

540
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,805
Gavin a diabetic?
Yes.

541
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,068
Hand him over.

542
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,975
Gavin Ieft our program
and our protection.
I don't have him.

543
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,069
Since when?

544
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,114
Since we moved his father
and he refused to go.

545
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,342
Said he had enough running
to Iast him for a Iifetime.

546
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,214
Didn't you find
that strange?
No.

547
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,947
Protectees exit
the program all the time.

548
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,215
You know,
we can't force them to join,

549
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,916
we can't stop them
if they want to Ieave.

550
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,787
PIus, he's an adult now.

551
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,224
Children Ieave
when they grow up.

552
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,091
So at Ieast
Iet us talk to Peter.

553
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,220
He'II know
where his son is.

554
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,265
It wouldn't do
any good.

555
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,391
They've severed
all contact.

556
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,833
From now on,
all phone calls and visits

557
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,599
are coordinated and monitored
by the Marshal's Service.

558
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,664
CIaudia, Gavin's not
going to stop,

559
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,608
and I hope
you're not hiding him
for Daddy's sake.

560
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,612
Now, why
would I do that?

561
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,875
To keep your witness
happy and talking.

562
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,215
Look for bad habits.

563
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,812
Gavin has a gambling problem.

564
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,324
But you didn't hear
that from me.

565
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,428
Gavin has racked up
a Iot of debt.

566
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,489
$10,000, $20,000
at a time.

567
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:19,367
So far, Peter has paid
about $100,000
in debts to Atlantic City.

568
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,134
How can he afford that?
Well, he can't.

569
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,198
They're behind
in the gym Iease

570
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,210
and the rentals
of the equipment.

571
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,336
Check this out.

572
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,880
New Jersey house
has three mortgages on it.

573
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:34,044
Yeah. $600 and $700 charges
on credit cards.

574
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,913
AII at the same restaurant?

575
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,489
You're sure about that?
Okay, thanks.

576
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,322
Vice says the place
is a known front

577
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,692
for an underground
gambling club downtown.

578
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,391
People can pay off their debts
by charging it to credit cards

579
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,195
for wine and filet
mignon dinners.

580
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,734
Russian restaurant?
No, it's Italian.

581
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,360
Now, the LUDs
from Jersey,

582
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,962
Iook at that,
a Iot of calls from downtown.

583
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,936
The Iast payment
was made a while ago.

584
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,204
Maybe they're not
too happy about that.

585
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,644
NYPD, Benson, Stabler.
Move aside.

586
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,211
Detectives, I'm Joe Tucci.
Tell me how I can help you.

587
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,688
CIose down.

588
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,517
This is an illegal club.

589
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,619
You're not from Vice.

590
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,463
Vice? I don't need to be
from Vice to ruin your day.

591
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,434
Causing you trouble sounds
Iike fun to me.

592
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,528
STABLER:
I'm gonna make the call,
get the ball rolling.

593
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,233
Now, what can I do
to make this right?
PIease.

594
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,968
Gavin Sipes.

595
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,134
He Iikes poker.

596
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,838
He Iikes it a Iot.
But he's not very good at it.

597
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,471
You found a Iot of money
coming your way.

598
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,516
Must've made you mad
when it stopped.

599
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,574
Sometimes people
need convincing.
Yeah?

600
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,917
So what'd you do?
You called Peter up?
Threatened his son's Iife?

601
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,253
You watch too many movies.
Dead men don't pay up.

602
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,882
AII right, come on,
stop screwing around.

603
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,119
Come on,
tell me what you need.

604
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,219
When's the next payment,
who's making it?

605
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,526
Peter called.
He's worried about his kid.

606
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,327
He's due here Iater
to talk over terms.

607
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,389
Well, what's he
so worried about

608
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,867
if you're such
a nice guy?

609
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,302
I'm a businessman.
Peter understands that.

610
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,806
His kid seems Iike
the type to try to skip.

611
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,205
I had to make it clear
to the old man,

612
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,868
his boy walks
into any gambling joint

613
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,640
anywhere in
this country, I'II know.
It won't be pleasant.

614
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,806
How much
does he owe?

615
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,112
400 grand
and still counting.

616
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,177
We're just
gonna stick around

617
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,653
and wait till Dad shows up,
if you don't mind.

618
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,888
My son didn't do this.

619
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,689
You knew he was guilty
after we talked to you.

620
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,787
He's the diabetic.

621
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,593
We need to know
where he is right now.

622
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,894
This is all my fault.

623
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,663
He stays out there,
the next woman could die.

624
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,863
I wish I knew
where he was.

625
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,471
Attacking these women,
gambling debts.

626
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,737
He's in so deep,
I don't know how to fix it.

627
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,609
STABLER: How old was he
when you went
into the program?

628
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,114
EIeven.

629
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,015
We were moved
five times in 10 years.

630
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,417
Every time,
he had to Iearn a new name.

631
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,685
New Iies for his past,
fit into a new school.

632
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,920
He missed so much
that finally
he just quit trying.

633
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,621
How can a Iittle boy
grow up to be a man

634
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,721
when he has no idea
who he really is?

635
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,992
What happened
to his mother?

636
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,624
Anna? Died.

637
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,371
That was before
we came into the program.

638
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,875
In fact, she was the reason
why I approached the Feds.

639
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,543
The Russians murdered her?

640
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,808
Punishment for skimming.

641
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,850
I used to be a chemist.

642
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,045
I was approached
by the Mikaelian Organizatsya

643
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,452
for a smuggling scam.

644
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,083
They moved millions of gallons
of grain alcohol to Europe

645
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,217
disguised as mouthwash.

646
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,922
I taught them
how to extract the blue dye.

647
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,259
It was very successful.

648
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,198
And then it was gas tax,
Medicaid fraud and extortion.

649
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,667
But you're the one
who got greedy,

650
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,897
so why kill your wife
instead of you?

651
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,165
Anna handled the money.

652
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,706
When she was caught
stealing from the family,

653
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,004
they killed her for it.

654
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,101
They were willing to do that
to their own flesh and blood,

655
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,907
what were they going to do
to me and my son?

656
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,574
So that's how
you got involved.
You married into it.

657
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,676
We met during the vodka scam.
After we married, I...

658
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:58,655
I rose very quickly
to vory v zakonye.

659
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,422
What does that mean?

660
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,223
I'm what's known
as a thief-in-Iaw.

661
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,628
Then there's about 500 eagles.

662
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,064
The rest are
Iieutenants, counselors.

663
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,035
AII in all, there's about
5,000 members in the US,

664
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,537
mostly assimilated
and accent free.

665
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,734
Not as organized
as the Italians,
but getting there.

666
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,436
So why did Gavin
target those women?

667
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,445
How did he even know
who they were?

668
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,209
I told him everything
about the Russians here,

669
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,614
in FIorida and in California.

670
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,051
I kept a record of everybody
I ever did business with.

671
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,917
Names, people I met.

672
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,217
He deserved to know the truth

673
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,383
about what his mother
and I did,

674
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,155
what he'd sacrificed
his Iife for.

675
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:41,426
Peter, the mob's
gonna wise up pretty soon,
if they haven't already.

676
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,127
He's targeting their women.
Now, what do you think
they're gonna do to him?

677
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,965
They're not gonna do
anything. He's gonna hide.

678
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,198
I cut him off.

679
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,274
I'm broke. I can't pay
his bills anymore.

680
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,742
Which means
he's a dead man.

681
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,974
He's got an addiction.
He can't Iay Iow for Iong.

682
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,679
If you Iove him, turn him in.

683
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,125
The Marshals are bringing
him to me today.

684
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:17,396
Supervised visit,
before they move me
one more time.

685
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,672
AII I ask is that
you don't hurt my son.

686
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,843
Here's the warrant.

687
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,886
I've notified the Iocals
in Connecticut, you'II be
in their jurisdiction.

688
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,421
Get any calls
from the US
Attorney's office?

689
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,547
No, nothing.

690
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:39,851
So much for cooperation.

691
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,084
We'II be able
to take custody

692
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,888
as soon as the US Marshals
pull up with our rapist.

693
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,294
AII right, just keep it clean.
I don't want some fight
with the Feds over injuries.

694
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,561
We're gonna Ieave.
We'II get a two-hour jump.

695
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,625
I'm here till it's done.

696
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:58,868
Car.

697
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,216
STABLER: That's him. Let's go.

698
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,863
Dad!
Oh, my God.

699
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,059
Dad!

700
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,630
No!

701
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,463
Dad!

702
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,032
Drop it! Do it now!
NYPD.

703
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,202
Drop the gun!
Drop it!

704
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,802
I said drop it.
Hold up. We're cops.

705
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,712
I don't give a damn.
Drop it or I'II drop you.

706
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,060
Both of you,
on the ground.

707
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,255
Move!

708
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,523
You, too.
On the ground.

709
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,806
Get their guns
and cuff them.

710
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,072
GAVIN: Oh, God.

711
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,753
I already told you
what happened.

712
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,812
Tell it to me again.

713
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,681
How'd you get the address?

714
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,283
Peter Sipes
gave it to me.

715
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,520
Then it's convenient
for you he's dead

716
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,290
since we can't
corroborate your story.

717
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,024
Yeah, that's one way
of Iooking at it.

718
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,929
No, that's how it is.

719
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,462
Well, this is crazy,
and I'm due a phone call.

720
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,970
Who else did you talk to?

721
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,062
No one.

722
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:39,438
Who else besides
the gambling club owner,
Joe Tucci?

723
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,071
I already answered
the question.

724
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,775
Did you interrogate
a Michael Kerring?

725
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,182
We did.

726
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,119
Were you aware that he
was a criminal associate
from California

727
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,485
who knew Sipes' identity?

728
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,716
Yes.

729
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,622
And yet you still
pursued him,

730
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:55,920
even though
you knew the deceased

731
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,723
to be a federally
protected witness

732
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,991
and that you were
endangering his Iife.

733
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,258
Is that correct, Detective?

734
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,733
We were pursuing
a rape suspect,
Gavin Sipes.

735
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,293
His father
gave us the address.

736
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,362
We were there to do our job.

737
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,373
And yet two men are dead.

738
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,671
One a Deputy US Marshal

739
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,678
with a wife
and three children.

740
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,052
How much do you
make a year?

741
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,183
It depends on overtime,
but why don't we say $68,940.

742
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,591
Must be hard to make ends meet
with a family of six.

743
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,563
I'm a cop.

744
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,868
And the NYPD has a history
of being squeaky clean.

745
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,540
I want my phone call.

746
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:50,240
We can hold you
for up to 72 hours
without giving you one.

747
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,610
Fallout from 9/11.

748
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,143
Who else
did you talk to?

749
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,244
I'm done talking.

750
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,913
Charge me or Iet me go.
Have a seat.

751
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,685
You know we had nothing
to do with the hit.

752
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,817
I'm not confessing,
so why don't you
just let me go?

753
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,691
You think I don't use
these tactics myself?

754
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,595
I can make you
sit down,
Detective Stabler.

755
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,962
Up to you.

756
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,066
You are officially
under investigation
by the FBI.

757
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,336
Your police jackets
and your financial records
have been subpoenaed.

758
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,843
New York Police Department
has been duly notified.

759
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:24,143
Internal Affairs is running
a concurrent investigation
into the matter.

760
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,978
This is a witch hunt
and you know it.

761
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,779
You Iost a witness
so you need someone to blame.

762
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,185
Two men are dead.
I told you to back off.
You didn't. You pay.

763
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,553
You can't connect us
to these murders.

764
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,784
We had nothing
to do with it.

765
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,018
You could've sold
the information,

766
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,653
or your bush Ieague tactics
could have Ied
the killers there.

767
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,026
Either way, you're culpable.

768
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,156
STABLER: Yeah? How?
Michael Kerring.

769
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,166
He ID'd Peter Sipes.

770
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,531
He's in Iockup
in our squad room.

771
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,435
Not anymore. They took
him away yesterday
for his arraignment.

772
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,599
He is now serving
30 days in Rikers
for shoplifting,

773
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,872
where he has access
to phone privileges
and the general population.

774
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,914
If Michael Kerring
ratted out Sipes,
we're not responsible.

775
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,677
I disagree.
Now if you don't mind,
I'm busy.

776
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,013
Yeah, we're not done yet.

777
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,383
You arrest Gavin Sipes?
You read him his rights?

778
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,716
No.

779
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,918
Then bring him
on in here. Now.

780
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,086
I can't. I sent him
to your precinct hours ago.

781
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,663
Gavin Sipes, he processed?

782
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,436
Three counts rape
in the first degree.

783
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,206
Just waiting on transport
to the Tombs.

784
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,446
How you holding up?

785
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,109
Denied my civil Iiberties,
treated Iike some skell,

786
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,913
suspected of conspiracy
to commit murder.

787
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,079
But, you know,
I think I've hit bottom.

788
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,419
IAB was here
digging for dirt.

789
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,649
I think I spoke too soon.

790
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,489
How bad is it?

791
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,960
US Attorneys
get a Iot of Ieeway
to make their cases.

792
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,397
The burden of proof
rests mostly
on the defendants.

793
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,957
But we did nothing wrong.

794
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,629
As Iaw enforcement officials,
you were well aware
of the risks

795
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,173
and you disregarded them
for your own benefit.

796
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,208
CIaudia could argue
that sensitive information

797
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,039
was passed on
to the criminal element.

798
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,306
Why would we do that?
What's our motive?

799
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,677
They don't need
to prove motive.

800
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,375
In your zeal to show up
federal officers,

801
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,010
a witness
and a US Marshal are dead.

802
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,316
That's all a jury
needs to hear.

803
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,083
If the Feds can't make
a criminal case,

804
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:17,219
you're still gonna have
to face the brass.
And they could boot you.

805
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,856
I'm not just handing over
my tin without a fight.

806
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,797
I don't expect you to.

807
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,662
(SIGHING)

808
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,765
We gotta find out
who killed Peter Sipes
to clear our name.

809
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,577
Munch, what do we have
on your witness,
Michael Kerring?

810
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:36,908
Did he talk to anybody
at Rikers?

811
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,005
He made some calls.

812
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,050
STABLER: To who?
One to Brighton Beach.

813
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,985
Go sit him down.
Shake him up
if you have to.

814
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,284
Don't sweat it.
We got your back.

815
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,223
Who else do we think
could have pulled this off?

816
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,317
That guy at the club
had a Iot of muscle.

817
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,829
And access
to professional hitters.

818
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,933
I didn't do
anything wrong.

819
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:03,235
Phone call went to a woman
named Beana Wolfman
in Brighton Beach.

820
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:07,266
Yeah. She's my girlfriend.
I begged her to get me
out of here. She refused.

821
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,370
She said she was tired
of wasting her money on me.

822
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,914
Smart girl.
So what's the problem?

823
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,472
You talk to her
and she'II tell you.

824
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,609
We already did.
Then why the third degree?

825
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,245
Ms. Wolfman
works in a restaurant
that's owned by the mob.

826
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,619
Turns out she has to
because she's here illegally.

827
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,918
What better way
to get her out from under

828
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,892
than to pass on
some valuable information?

829
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,222
You don't know
what you're talking about.

830
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,422
The Organizatsya
does not work that way.

831
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,589
Then explain it to us.

832
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,428
They don't Ieave Ioose ends.

833
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,061
If I had talked,
someone in here
would've killed me already.

834
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,034
Hey, step back.

835
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,412
You wanted me
to set you up with some chips,
you just had to ask.

836
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,039
STABLER: You're
a generous guy there, Joe.

837
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,606
What gives?

838
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,346
Send some of your boys
to do a Iittle house cleaning?

839
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,388
Like what?
Like murder.

840
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,481
Peter Sipes
was killed yesterday.

841
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,287
It wasn't me.
I think it was.

842
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,486
You had about 400,000
reasons to kill him.

843
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,029
You don't know
what you're talking about.

844
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,155
The account's been closed.

845
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,597
Oh, just Iike that,
it's closed?

846
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,000
Yeah, the debt was paid
in full not an hour
after you Ieft.

847
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,096
By who?
Gavin Sipes.

848
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,606
In cash.

849
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,666
You wanna get off me now?

850
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,153
How's your glucose Ievel?

851
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,383
You need some insulin?

852
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,956
I got time.

853
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,858
What's your real name?

854
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,158
Nikolai.

855
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,727
Nikolai.

856
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,759
It fits you.
Names are important.

857
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,429
I've had several.

858
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,937
I was Joshua for a while.
David, Daniel.

859
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,644
I was even a Thomas
for a whole nine days.

860
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,771
Why such a short time
with Thomas?

861
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,939
I screwed up.

862
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,642
I forgot our cover story.

863
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,880
So for once,
I just told the truth.

864
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,117
How old were you
when that happened?

865
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,250
Thirteen.

866
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,087
Everyone was upset.

867
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,632
My dad, the Marshals,
the attorneys.

868
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,700
They told me
it cost a fortune to move us.

869
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,262
If I kept running my mouth,
it would get us killed.

870
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,070
That's a hell
of a Iot of guilt for a kid.

871
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,006
Childhood's the time
to make mistakes.

872
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,843
Not in the program.

873
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,307
When we first went in,

874
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,354
Dad would sit
against the window
with a gun.

875
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,647
He never slept.

876
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,893
He'd have panic attacks,
so we didn't go out.

877
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,466
I used to ask him why,
why we Iived Iike that,

878
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,831
and all he'd say
was "someday."

879
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,865
When did he
finally come clean?

880
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,634
When I got my GED.

881
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,645
We moved around so much,
I couldn't even get a Iousy
high school diploma.

882
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,908
I had to take a test
with a bunch of Iosers,

883
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,143
pretending that it was
gonna change our Iives.

884
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,710
Well, maybe he wanted you
to be proud of him
for doing the right thing,

885
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,588
to Iet you know
that your sacrifice
meant something.

886
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,888
What he wanted was for me
to make him feel better

887
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,192
about screwing me
out of a future.

888
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,824
Is that when you
decided to get even?

889
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,859
Get even for what?

890
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,927
For getting screwed
by your parents.

891
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,270
Especially your mother.

892
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,810
You can't hold a grudge
against the dead.

893
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,174
Oh, sure you can.

894
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:32,243
She died on you
before you could vent
your anger.

895
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,882
Your mother betrayed you.

896
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,717
Both your parents
betrayed you.
No.

897
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,424
No? So why are you
raping innocent women

898
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,929
in some Iocal
mob boss's Iife?

899
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,656
Innocent?
Yeah.

900
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:52,169
Petra was a stripper,
Iiving off the proceeds
of Sergei's victims.

901
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,862
His sister, Tatiana, decided

902
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,840
where the illegals
would work off their debts.

903
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,900
And Amanda
was washing off the blood
from their money.

904
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,610
Those bitches
Iost their innocence
way before I was even born.

905
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,918
Just too easy,
though, huh?

906
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,953
Raping those women
couldn't even the score.

907
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,388
Nothing could make up
for those Iost years,
could it?

908
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,652
Is that why
your father had to die?

909
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,293
I don't know
what you're talking about.

910
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,562
Sure, you do.

911
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,834
What better way to get back
at your old man

912
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:31,739
than to turn him over
to the very people
that he's testifying against?

913
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,608
That's not how it happened.

914
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,773
No?

915
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,915
Then why call
a butcher shop
in Brighton Beach?

916
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,850
Why call the house
in Connecticut

917
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,355
where your father
is staying,

918
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,052
if not to make sure
that he was home?

919
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,892
I didn't have the money,

920
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,403
and he wouldn't
give me any more.

921
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,333
What was I supposed to do?

922
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,246
They were gonna kill me.

923
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,345
(STABLER SIGHING)

924
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,315
Yeah, and now we will.

925
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:18,249
Murder of a Iaw
enforcement officer
is an automatic needle.

926
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,688
I didn't think
that they were
gonna kill him.

927
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,318
Sergei said
he just wanted
to talk to Dad.

928
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,302
You talked
to Sergei Perlman
yourself?

929
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,429
I met with his Iieutenant.

930
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,769
I was there
when he called him,

931
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,606
and I spoke to Sergei
on the phone.

932
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:54,055
That's them.
CIaudia's not here.

933
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,854
Where the hell are they?

934
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,689
We gotta take them.

935
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,197
BENSON: Sergei Perlman.

936
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,633
Are you
Sergei Perlman?
Yes.

937
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,263
You're under arrest.
Step back, please.

938
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,829
You're under arrest
for the murders

939
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,705
of Peter Sipes
and Deputy US Marshal
Raymond Lee.

940
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,005
You have the right
to remain silent.

941
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,638
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of Iaw.

942
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,942
You have the right
to an attorney.

943
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,279
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

944
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,717
Do you understand
these rights?

945
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:29,119
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

946
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,156
Stabler.

947
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:46,174
PARAMEDIC: Heads up.
Watch your back,
watch your back.

948
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,281
You arrest Sergei Perlman?

949
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,381
He's in Central Booking now.

950
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,448
We're gonna have to
vacate the charges.

951
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,517
We're gonna have to
Iet him walk.

952
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,586
Yeah.
What happened?

953
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,098
Shooter entered the courtyard
masking as a guard.

954
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,431
Opened fire
with an automatic weapon.

955
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,765
Russian?

956
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,033
No ID, but I'd bet
my Iife on it.

957
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,141
Sergei had to buy
the information

958
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,109
on Gavin's transfer
in order to pull this off.

959
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,145
He had to get it
from someone inside.

960
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,407
Probably.

961
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,049
What's your next move?

962
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,452
That's just it, Detective.

963
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,681
I don't have one.

964
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,188
CIaudia.

965
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,031
If you need anything...
