00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,198
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,898
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous.

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,167
In New York City,

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,142
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,703
are members of
an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,408
These are their stories.

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,617
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

8
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,984
Everyone stay
with your partners
and sit in front.

9
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,329
Mrs. MacNamara,
Caleb's not sitting
in the front.

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,092
Yes, Stacey,
I can see.

11
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,599
We need to be Iet off
at the Natural
History Museum.

12
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,100
I stop at
81st Street.

13
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,933
CALEB: Mrs. MacNamara,
someone's Ieft
their suitcase.

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,607
It's pretty heavy.

15
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:47,204
Don't touch it, Caleb.
I want everyone off
this bus right now.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,975
GIRL 1: Why?
GIRL 2: Why?

17
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,376
We cleared 250 feet
in every direction.
It's all yours.

18
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,251
Okay.

19
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,584
Gonna take Iong
to set up the X-ray?

20
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,090
No, they're good to go.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,435
ESU SERGEANT: Could be
nothing. Maybe somebody
just forgot their suitcase.

22
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,631
BOMB SQUAD DETECTIVE:
Till it's properly ID'd,
I'm not taking any chances.

23
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,367
X-ray should tell
us clear enough.

24
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,370
Image is coming up.

25
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:26,675
Oh, man, it's not a bomb.

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,421
Female victim,
eight or nine, no ID.

27
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,789
Jammed inside a suitcase
which was Ieft on the bus.

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,225
Driver remember
who brought it on?

29
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,853
Nope. This was
his third run.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,831
Could be anyone
from Union Square
to 147th Street.

31
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,423
Basically all
of Manhattan.

32
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,059
Cause of death?

33
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,660
I don't
know yet.

34
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,002
How Iong she been
in the suitcase?

35
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,301
WARNER: Hard to say.

36
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,740
She has Iigature marks
on her ankles and wrists.

37
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,278
That and the Iividity,
she had to be held
somewhere else first,

38
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,213
tied in the cuffing position,
hands behind her back.

39
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,945
She's got French nails.
Nice manicure.

40
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,078
Pedicure, too.
Salon job.

41
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,124
Looks Iike she got
the full treatment.

42
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,818
She's got dark roots.

43
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,451
She's not a natural blonde.

44
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,088
Isn't she a bit young
to be made up
Iike a fashion model?

45
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,655
BENSON: Not if she's on
the kiddy pageant circuit.

46
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,460
As in JonBenet?

47
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,733
Yep. We got ourselves
a dead beauty queen.

48
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,923
Rape kit was
positive for fluids,
I'm running the DNA.

49
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,015
We know
how she died?

50
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,184
Afraid so.

51
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,923
I found vomit
and fragments of
Iatex in her mouth.

52
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,090
So he ties her up,
he rapes her.

53
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,566
She's terrified, throws up,
can't remove the gag.

54
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,603
And our perp just
watches her die.

55
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,731
I also found a piece
of saw grass on
the inside of her sweater.

56
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,139
Saw grass?
Does that grow
around here?

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,336
No.

58
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,869
It grows almost exclusively
in the FIorida Everglades.

59
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,075
So, maybe he
kidnapped her down there,
brought her up here.

60
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,084
Anything to support
the beauty pageant theory?

61
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,551
You bet.

62
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,613
Obliquely oriented
cicatricial contracture along
the internal nasal vault.

63
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,715
What the hell is that?

64
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,123
A damn good nose job.

65
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,725
Suitcase model
was discontinued
10 years ago,

66
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,231
but it used to be
available nationwide.

67
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,462
Couple of partial prints,
but not enough to
make a positive ID.

68
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,504
Nobody saw the guy
Ieave it on the bus?

69
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,630
Patrol's passing out flyers
along the bus route.

70
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,471
Nothing yet,
except some old Iady
said she saw Osama bin Laden.

71
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,737
And the victim?

72
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,406
No missing kid reports
in FIorida or the tri-state
area in the Iast 24 hours.

73
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,743
Any hits on
beauty contests?

74
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,078
I faxed the victim's photo

75
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,079
to the Little
Miss Angel Pageant
in Westchester.

76
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,179
They checked it against
finalists for the Iast
two years, no matches.

77
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,192
Well, to make
the nationals, you must
have to compete Iocally.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,784
Any recent contests
in the area?

79
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,123
BENSON: Actually,
in the Iast two months,

80
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,754
one in Queens,
one in Greenwich,

81
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,856
and one coming
up in Garden City.

82
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,594
I wonder how many
of these
Little Miss Angels

83
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,898
get nose jobs
when they're nine.

84
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,337
OIivia, you and EIIiot
talk to the nip and tuck
brigade.

85
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,638
John, what do you say,
you and me check out
the kiddie pageant scene?

86
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,405
(MUSIC PLAYING)

87
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,039
SYLVIA: Girls,
practice your entrances.

88
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,983
Six steps, stop,
smile and twirl.

89
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,610
Step, stop,
smile and twirl.

90
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,746
CRAGEN: New York City Police.
We need a word.

91
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,791
Parents actually pay you
to inflict this
on their kids?

92
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,419
Yes. The young Iadies
find it very
character forming.

93
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,521
I have taught
Iiterally hundreds
of aspiring Little Angels.

94
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,929
You teach this one?

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,059
Oh, my God!
What happened?

96
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,832
Her body was found
this morning. We think
she might be a contestant.

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,208
Not in any
recent competitions.

98
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,835
But I do keep files
of all the hopefuls
who don't make the cut.

99
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,071
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

100
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,306
They're arranged
alphabetically.

101
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,870
What? Yeah.

102
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,041
So, can anybody get in
to see the pageants?

103
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,848
Oh, no, we are very
strict about checking
people's door badges.

104
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,218
How hard is it
to get a badge?

105
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,688
$25.

106
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,719
That was OIivia.

107
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,785
Nassau cops put out
a missing kid alert
about an hour ago.

108
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,888
Girl's name is Cherie Lathan,
Iives in Valley Stream.

109
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,128
OIivia and EIIiot
are on their way
to talk to the parents.

110
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,500
Bingo, I got a match
on the victim.

111
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,338
Mr. Lathan,
how Iong has Cherie
been competing?

112
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,504
About four years.

113
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,481
After one of her friends
entered the Little Miss Angel
Pageant,

114
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,542
Cherie wanted
to do it, too.

115
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,450
And when was
her Iast pageant?

116
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,389
Three months ago,
right before she
had an operation.

117
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,983
PIastic surgery.

118
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,690
You're never gonna
have that edge,
if you don't go for it.

119
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,992
It's what
Cherie wanted.

120
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,589
It's what
you wanted.

121
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,000
Why did it take you
so Iong to report
your daughter missing?

122
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,437
Last night she slept over
at her friend
Amy Prescott's house,

123
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,635
and this morning
she was supposed
to go right to school.

124
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,976
That's where
I thought she was.

125
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,139
When was the Iast
time you saw Cherie?

126
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,174
Yesterday afternoon,
when he took her to
get new headshots.

127
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,016
And then I dropped
her off at Amy's.

128
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,182
We'II need Amy's address.
Have you been to
FIorida recently?

129
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,955
(SOBBING) We took Cherie
to Disney World
at Christmas.

130
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,090
We're going to
need a DNA sample,
Mr. Lathan.

131
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,227
It's standard procedure.

132
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:48,399
I know what you're thinking,
but I'd never hurt Cherie.

133
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,704
I worshipped her.

134
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,251
Did Cherie spend the night
here Iast night,
Mrs. Prescott?

135
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,649
Yes.

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,688
And did she go to school
this morning with Amy?

137
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,691
Amy came down
with the flu, so
Cherie went on her own.

138
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,497
I offered to give her
a ride to the bus stop,
but she said she'd walk.

139
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,965
How far away
is the bus stop?

140
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,264
Four blocks.

141
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,804
I should have insisted
on driving her,

142
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,363
but I didn't want
to Ieave Amy.

143
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,373
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,012
Amy, did Cherie
ever mention anyone
bothering her?

145
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,040
Kind of.

146
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,551
STABLER: Yeah?
Who's that?

147
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,452
There's this creepy
guy in tenth grade.

148
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,080
What's his name?

149
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,648
Kevin. I don't know
his Iast name.

150
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,127
What sorts of things
did Kevin do?

151
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,796
He used to come up to us
and tell Cherie that
she Iooked really hot.

152
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,167
You know,
Iike he meant it.

153
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,764
Mmm-hmm.

154
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,205
He ever follow
you guys around?

155
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,400
Sometimes.

156
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,105
And he'd hang around
at gymnastics practice
and just stare at us.

157
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,171
MUNCH: Kevin's
an enterprising
young man.

158
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,717
He posts his stories
for the world to read
on his own website.

159
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,843
Listen to this.

160
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,015
"9-year-old flesh is Iike
fruit from the tree,
firm but sweet.

161
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,820
"What I would do
to take a bite
out of Cherie."

162
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,053
It's downhill
from there.

163
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,118
School have anything
to say about him?

164
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,529
Guidance counselor said he
recently persuaded a sixth
grader to pose in a bikini.

165
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,658
He said it was
for an art project.

166
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,794
This creep is 15.
You tell me that's
not predatory behavior.

167
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,168
Well, he Iooks
good for it.

168
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,333
Especially since
the DNA on Cherie's
father came back clean.

169
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,308
He still turned
his daughter into
a sex object.

170
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,743
Made her ripe for
Kevin's picking.

171
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,748
CRAGEN: That must be
Kevin and his dad.
Talk to them.

172
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,318
Where were you
this morning, Kevin?
School marked you absent.

173
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,515
MR. ROUMEL:
You were ditching?

174
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,955
I was walking around.
It helps me think.

175
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,822
That's not much
of an alibi.

176
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,761
I don't need an alibi.
I would never touch Cherie.

177
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,923
You hurt her pretty bad
in your Iittle stories.

178
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,694
"She tried to escape,
but I was too strong.

179
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,530
"I held her down and
Iicked her tears away."

180
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,867
Look, they're just stories,
all right.
Creative expression.

181
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,601
The minute you censor them,
you're just Iike a Nazi.

182
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,972
Cherie was raped
and murdered.

183
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,908
I don't want to hear
about your damn stories.

184
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,378
Look, I make stuff up,
I don't do it.

185
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,914
Then give us a DNA sample.

186
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,847
No. You can't violate
my civil Iiberties

187
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,852
just because I've
got a good imagination.

188
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,579
He'II give
you a sample.

189
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,179
You can't force me.
MUNCH: Sure he can.

190
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,622
Parental consent
is all we need
till you're 16.

191
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,150
This isn't fair.
You fascists Iay one
finger on me, I will sue.

192
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,457
Sit down, you Iittle prick.

193
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,519
(GRUNTS)

194
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,899
Will this do?

195
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,804
Sorry, no match.
It's not Kevin.

196
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,238
Maybe not this time,
just give him
a couple of years.

197
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,570
So, we've got nothing.

198
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:37,700
Not exactly.

199
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,110
BIood traces in the perp's
ejaculate gave us something
interesting.

200
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,239
High Ievels
of progesterone.

201
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,908
Well, that's a female hormone.

202
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,680
Most often given
to high school girls
to prevent pregnancy.

203
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,653
So, why's our
perp taking that?

204
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,690
To block
testosterone
production.

205
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,817
He could be using it
to treat advanced
prostatic cancer,

206
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,556
or he's undergoing
male-to-female
gender reassignment.

207
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,894
And it's given
to sex offenders
to reduce sex drive.

208
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,196
But synthetic
testosterone isn't.

209
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,236
I also found traces
of that in the blood.

210
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,637
Our guy's trying to
reverse the effects of
chemical castration.

211
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,538
He raped a girl,
I'd say he succeeded.

212
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,600
And I bet that freak
won't stop at one.

213
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,950
New York doesn't
chemically castrate
sex offenders.

214
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,815
We got nine states that do,
Georgia being the closest one
to us.

215
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,513
What about voluntary
castration?

216
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,352
Technically you can
self-inject, but we're
doubting our guy did.

217
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,052
I mean, otherwise
what's he doing
taking testosterone?

218
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,389
He's done
his homework.

219
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,555
The effects of Depo-Provera
can be blocked within a week

220
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,258
by using testosterone
supplements.

221
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,960
So this guy
traded in his breasts
for a sex drive.

222
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,730
Does that fit
the crime scene profile?

223
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,464
Absolutely.

224
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,972
Beauty pageants
offer the killer
the perfect victim.

225
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,670
Sexualized children
who are both
innocent and provocative.

226
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,178
EIaborate bondage shows
that he fantasized
about this for a Iong time

227
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,113
before he dared
even act on it.

228
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,378
Get a Iist of castratees
from the nine states.

229
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,388
Check probation violations,
relocations and
child-abduction priors.

230
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,650
Prison bureau in Georgia,
they send you
to the parole board

231
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,160
which sends you to
the state attorney,

232
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,560
who sends you back
to the parole board.

233
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,861
Yeah, I got the same
run around in Oregon,
Texas and Louisiana.

234
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,867
Chemical castration
hasn't been Iegal
Iong enough

235
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,266
for there to be
a centralized database.

236
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,602
Look, there's got
to be a way for us
to narrow this down.

237
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,337
AII right,
FIorida is one
of our states.

238
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,709
We've been thinking that

239
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,748
Cherie got that
saw grass on her

240
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,407
when she took
that trip to Orlando.

241
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,941
But the ME says that
saw grass grows exclusively
in the Everglades.

242
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,112
That's south of there.

243
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:34,125
Our perp undresses Cherie,
he transfers the saw grass
from his clothes to hers?

244
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,390
Okay, maybe. Now, what do we
know about these three upright
citizens in FIorida?

245
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,760
Well, one died in a car crash,

246
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,425
and the parole
officers for the other two
say they're squeaky clean.

247
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,832
Squeaky-clean sex offender,
yeah, that's a new one.

248
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:49,136
Rob Canotti from Milwaukee
started chemical castration
treatments four years ago.

249
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,075
Had a supervised
relocation to Jersey City.

250
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,874
Well, maybe, he made an
unsupervised trip to FIorida.

251
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,244
What was Canotti
charged with?

252
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,044
He kidnapped a girl
from a beauty pageant.

253
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,176
He tried to assault
her in his car.

254
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,447
The girl escaped.
She was 10.

255
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,120
BENSON: Rob Canotti?

256
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,591
New York Police
in Jersey City.

257
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,726
Has a child
been attacked?

258
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,463
Why would you ask
us that question?

259
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,562
Why else are
you here?

260
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,971
To talk about
kiddie beauty pageants.

261
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,101
We hear they
turn you on.

262
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,645
If I denied it,
you'd call me a Iiar.

263
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,205
You ever see a Iittle girl
named Cherie Lathan compete?

264
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:35,777
Not that I recall,
but it's hard to keep track
of so many Iittle Iovelies.

265
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,254
Where were you
Iast night?

266
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,588
At home watching
Nickelodeon.

267
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,127
Can anyone
vouch for that?

268
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,492
I Iive alone.

269
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,292
Well, then, I think
you better come with us.

270
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,389
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
There's no point.

271
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,490
INTO PHONE: Benson.

272
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,137
The guy you're Iooking for
probably ejaculated
in his victim.

273
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,432
What are you saying?

274
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,732
(SIGHS)

275
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,606
The urges started
to come back.

276
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,011
So I had them
cut off.

277
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,206
What?

278
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,949
My gonads, Detective.
Take a Iook.

279
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,181
AII right, all right.
Put your johnson
back in your pants, Canotti.

280
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,154
That was Fin.

281
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,318
Turns out one of our
squeaky-clean FIorida boys

282
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,419
has a mother
who Iives two towns
over from Cherie Lathan.

283
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,690
What's his name?
Tommy Hedges.

284
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,288
Munch and Fin are on
their way over now.

285
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,103
This was Tommy's room,
but I've kept it the same
since he was a boy.

286
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,867
He ever visit from FIorida,
Mrs. Hedges?

287
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,400
No, of course not.
He can't Ieave the state
while he's on probation.

288
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,539
But he knows that his
room is here for him
when he's done his time.

289
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,173
That's your van
in the driveway?

290
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,774
It was my
Iate husband's.

291
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,342
FIN: Lady Iike you,
Iiving all alone,

292
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,047
what do you need
a big van for?

293
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,384
I'm keeping it
for Tommy.

294
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,889
Mind if we take
a Iook inside?

295
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,127
I haven't driven
it in over a year.

296
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,095
I don't even know
where the keys are.

297
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,392
Tommy ever talk to you
about his problems?

298
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,365
They're in the past.

299
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,631
I mean, he feels terrible
about what he did,
but he's changed.

300
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,069
FIN: How?

301
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,974
He's on medication,
and he's found
a job in FIorida.

302
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,712
He's determined to
start a new Iife.

303
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,079
That's awfully clean
for a van that hasn't
been driven in a year.

304
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,981
I say we haul Mom
in for questioning.

305
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,987
I don't Iike sweating
old Iadies. It offends
my sense of decorum.

306
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,886
Oh, you'd rather be
Iooking through garbage?

307
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,289
Cop's gotta do
what he's gotta do.

308
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:25,058
"Mundialfarmacia.com,
laboratorios de Mexico. "

309
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,729
Liquid testosterone.

310
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,529
Hey, get away
from there!

311
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,503
That's private property.
You can't just go on
Iooking through that.

312
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,564
It's on the street,
we can Iook all we want.

313
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,610
Tommy's been
coming home,
hasn't he?

314
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,941
I don't know what
you're talking about.

315
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,981
Well, that's his name
and Iast week's date.

316
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,079
We need to see him.

317
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,814
Look, you have to understand,
Tommy really is better.

318
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,483
He found a job
at an advertising
agency in New York.

319
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,185
He works Monday
through Thursday's,

320
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,956
and then he
flies down to Miami
to get his injection.

321
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,155
He's cured.

322
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,366
Tommy Hedges? Police.
We need you to come with us.

323
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,463
What for?
Parole violation.

324
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,974
Oh, Iook, I can explain that.
My parole officer knows
I'm here.

325
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,204
No, he doesn't.
Let's go.

326
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,106
Sure, no problem.

327
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,242
You don't mind
if we take this?

328
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,716
I Iooked for
a job in FIorida,

329
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,417
but no one would
give me a chance
because of my record.

330
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,982
So I came back home.

331
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,190
The Iast thing I wanted
to do was fly up each week,
but I was desperate.

332
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,357
BENSON: That's a sad story,
Tommy.

333
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,262
I'm not asking
for pity,

334
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,998
but everyone thinks
sex offender registration
is this great idea.

335
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,768
It's not. It's hell,

336
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,968
especially for those of us
who are trying to make
a new start.

337
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:55,477
Look,
I know I've broken parole,
but I'm taking my shots.

338
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,889
What does your parole officer
think you're doing?

339
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,650
Telemarketing from home.

340
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,255
He never does
a curfew check.

341
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,926
I fly back to Miami
every Friday,
and meet him and get my shot.

342
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,572
So what are you doing
with testosterone, huh?

343
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,106
That for jet Iag?

344
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,608
I want to Iive
a normal Iife.

345
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,148
Be in a normal
relationship.

346
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,777
What woman wants a guy
who can't perform?

347
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,650
Does Cherie Lathan
count as a woman?

348
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,915
I don't know
who she is.

349
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,489
It's the 9-year-old
you raped and killed.

350
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,328
No. This is a mistake.

351
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,425
STABLER: Well, okay.

352
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,163
Well, Tommy,
if that's the truth,

353
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,728
then we're gonna
be the first ones
to apologize to you.

354
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,104
We got plenty of ways
to check it out.

355
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,541
Which flight you
took from FIorida,
Friday night,

356
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,636
after you met with
your parole officer.

357
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,240
Whether there's any trace
evidence of Cherie Lathan
in your daddy's old van.

358
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,844
Whether your DNA
matches the fluids
found in the girl.

359
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,121
Some of that'II
take time,

360
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,283
but since you're
going back to prison

361
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,793
for parole violation
for at Ieast 10 years,

362
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,387
I guess you're
not in any hurry.

363
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,624
STABLER: Tommy.

364
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,592
What happened?

365
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,298
Just tell us.
You'II feel better,
I promise you.

366
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,140
What's the matter?

367
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,347
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

368
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,724
I'd noticed her before,
with the other girls,
just walking around.

369
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,388
She stood out Iike
a Iittle princess.

370
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,592
I offered her a ride.

371
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,898
I just wanted
to talk to her.

372
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,500
She was so
sweet and Iovely.

373
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,669
Where did you
do it, Tommy?

374
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,445
In the van.

375
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,144
She was crying afterwards.

376
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,484
She was saying she would tell,
and I had to keep her quiet.

377
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,148
And she wouldn't stop crying.

378
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,782
I had to stop her.

379
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,019
So you gagged her.

380
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,425
Yeah.

381
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,588
And then I Ieft
to get some air,

382
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,689
and when I came back,
she wasn't moving.

383
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,094
I didn't mean
to hurt her.

384
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,937
Tommy, have you hurt
any others, other than Cherie?

385
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,501
TOMMY: No.

386
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,913
I thought I could
control my feelings
until I read that story.

387
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,484
What story?

388
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,523
On the Internet. This...

389
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,721
It had pictures and
words and everything.

390
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,659
It stuck in my head.

391
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,527
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

392
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,294
Lab's got something
you should see.

393
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,669
In all, he's got about
40 kiddie porn shots on there.

394
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,074
His parole officer probably
missed, they were hidden
by the S-Tools software.

395
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,373
S-Tools?
Yeah.

396
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,879
"S" is short
for steganography.

397
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,005
Oh.

398
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,312
From the Greek,
meaning "hidden writing."

399
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,217
Mainly used by spies
to send concealed messages.

400
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:19,155
So Hedges downloads the child
porn and disguises it with
this stegosaurus stuff.

401
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,784
The porn can be hidden
in a photo of a sunset,
anything at all.

402
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,522
Hedges simply uses the S-Tools
to download and decode it.

403
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,790
So how'd you find it?

404
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,025
I went onto his hard drive
and used his own software.

405
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,898
This is what I thought
you should see.

406
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,369
"The Story of Janet. "

407
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:41,242
MORALES: Basically, it's a how
to on stalking, abducting
and raping Iittle girls,

408
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,338
with accompanying photos.

409
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:52,886
Wait a minute, she's tied up
the same way, and in the same
position, as Cherie Lathan.

410
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,553
The bastard downloaded
the photos, and copied
exactly what he saw.

411
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,232
Just because porn inspired
Tommy Hedges to murder doesn't
diminish his culpability.

412
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,964
Hedges deserves everything
that's coming to him,

413
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,699
but whoever produced
these is guilty, too.

414
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,537
Of producing
and distributing child
pornography, not murder.

415
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,509
Look, Hedges copied
exactly what he saw.

416
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,012
These photos are as dangerous
as putting a Ioaded weapon

417
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,809
in the hands of
a violent criminal.

418
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,873
I'm not saying
child pornography
isn't repugnant,

419
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,782
but you would
have a hard time
convincing a jury

420
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,717
that a murderer
and a pornographer
are equally guilty.

421
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:23,914
Doc, what do you think?

422
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,481
A Canadian study found that
90% of child sex abusers
used hardcore pornography.

423
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,618
Well, did it make them
all go out and commit murder?

424
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,322
Pornography desensitizes.

425
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,387
Repeated viewing
can condition arousal,

426
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,628
so that the viewer seeks out
more violent,
more degrading images.

427
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,567
It can also increase
the tendency to act out

428
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,127
some of the activities
that are portrayed.

429
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,639
So the murderer has
no choice in the matter?
I don't buy it.

430
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,902
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

431
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,570
Hedges already
molested children.

432
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,704
So he was highly susceptible
to these images.

433
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,839
You view it,
you fantasize about it,
you do it.

434
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,110
I agree with EIIiot.

435
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,812
Cherie Lathan might still
be alive if Hedges hadn't
seen these pictures.

436
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,114
I can't
indict pictures.

437
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,156
You can indict the producers
and the distributors.

438
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,747
They could be
anywhere in the world.

439
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:03,420
Crime Iab found the website
through Hedges' Iaptop.

440
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,022
With the help
of ARIN registry,
we got the address.

441
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,363
Cyberloves Incorporated
in Queens.

442
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,034
Bust them.

443
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,305
STABLER: NYPD!
Everyone stay where you are.

444
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,743
MAN: Officers,
what can I do for you?

445
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,109
Get out of my way.

446
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,613
MAN: Excuse me,
this is private property.

447
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,944
BENSON: Yeah,
and there's your warrant.

448
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,008
STABLER: You all right?
What's your problem?

449
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,814
What's my problem?
How old are you?

450
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,286
Nineteen.

451
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,084
STABLER: Let me see some ID.

452
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,125
What's my problem?

453
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,890
You always carry around
a birth certificate with you?

454
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,366
Yeah, 'cause I'm
sick of getting harassed
by cops when I'm modeling.

455
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,132
Modeling, right.
It says she's 19.
Let's check that out.

456
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,174
This picture was found
on your company's website.

457
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,368
You know who she is?

458
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,171
No.

459
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,972
She Iook 19 to you?

460
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,173
No idea.

461
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,307
BENSON: Who do you work for?
Cyberloves.

462
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,214
I'm not breaking any Iaw.

463
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,550
Sweetheart, a 9-year-old girl
was murdered, just Iike
the girl in this photo,

464
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,749
and it was posted
on Cyberloves' website

465
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,349
by the dirt bag
that you're working for.

466
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,395
Who runs this operation?

467
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,655
BENSON: Who signs
your paycheck?

468
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,967
Excel Entertainment.
Stanley Billings.

469
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,105
No girl working for
Excel Entertainment
is underage.

470
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,635
That's the company policy,
and it is strictly enforced.

471
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,614
Now, Mr. Billings,
does your website,

472
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,547
cyberloves.net,
sell The Story of Janet?

473
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,811
Yes.

474
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,978
And on a Tanner scale,
she scores pretty Iow.

475
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,113
Tanner scale?
I don't know
what that is.

476
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,589
It's a body
development chart.

477
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,626
One being prepubescent,
5 being adult.

478
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,524
Now, Janet is a two.

479
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,694
Some girls
develop slowly.

480
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,222
Don't hand me that crap.
My 10-year-old daughter
Iooks more mature than that.

481
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,930
I told you,
we have a company rule,
no underage models.

482
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,097
Why would I risk
my business?

483
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,141
Happy pedophiles
spend more money.

484
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,033
(SIGHS)

485
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,942
You ever heard of
virtual pornography?

486
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,915
That girl is 18. Legal age.
We only help her
Iook younger.

487
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,246
And how's that?

488
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,886
With youth
enhancement software.

489
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,082
The people that
get off on this
don't think she's 18.

490
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:16,617
But she is,
and Iooking at that
is not a crime.

491
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:20,631
Thousands of men and women
enjoy the services of
Excel Entertainment.

492
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:24,260
Virtual pornography is
actually therapeutic,

493
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,328
it provides for men
a cathartic release,

494
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,307
and it still
protects the real kids.

495
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,138
Not all of them.

496
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,303
Somebody went out
and copied your images,

497
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,939
and a real 9-year-old
child wound up dead.

498
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:44,045
Then I'm truly sorry,
but I still haven't
broken the Iaw.

499
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,522
The Story of Janet
is a murder manual.

500
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,424
Your pornography is
responsible for the death
of an innocent child.

501
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,827
Read the Supreme Court ruling.
"The mere tendency of speech,

502
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:57,631
"to encourage unlawful acts
is not a sufficient reason
for banning it."

503
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,035
The scary thing is,
the girl in the picture
probably is 18.

504
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,303
You're telling me
photo touch-ups
can make her Iook 10?

505
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,311
Yeah, Billings takes
the digital software

506
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,371
used to age up
the missing photos of
kids on milk cartons,

507
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,612
but uses it in reverse
to age them down.

508
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:14,777
Look.

509
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,887
I took a photo of you,
OIivia,

510
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,118
and broke it down
into its thousands
of digital parts.

511
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,821
Once the parts are isolated,
you can morph them
in whatever way you want.

512
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:24,953
Oh, my God.

513
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,295
Yeah, the good news is that
a trained eye can
usually tell when it's fake.

514
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,856
STABLER: What's the bad news?

515
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,562
In the field of
image manipulation,

516
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,501
the porn industry
Ieads the way.

517
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,598
Are you telling me
these sick bastards

518
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,510
can make virtual kiddie porn
and not break the Iaw?

519
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,207
I'm afraid so.

520
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,476
Excel Entertainment
is skirting the Ietter
of the Iaw

521
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,882
by exploiting
the fantasies
of pedophiles.

522
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,820
It's reprehensible,
and it's perfectly Iegal.

523
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,950
Can't Excel be required
to safeguard their website
from vulnerable viewers?

524
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,586
They already do.
You have to be 18
or older to Iog on.

525
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,890
STABLER: What about
The Story of Janet?

526
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,864
They're sending
out sadistic pictures

527
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,561
along with instructions
on how to abduct
and rape Iittle girls.

528
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,332
Then they top it off
by telling you how to
avoid getting caught.

529
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,339
There must be
something we can
do about that.

530
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,774
No. Billings will
wrap himself up
in the First Amendment,

531
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,243
and cry freedom of speech.

532
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,372
This is so wrong.
Look, you're...

533
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,514
AII you're saying
is the constitution
allows someone

534
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:25,647
to publish a blueprint
for child rape as Iong
as he calls it art.

535
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,051
Wait a minute.

536
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,893
If we can prove that
Billings provided
assistance to Tommy Hedges

537
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:36,092
in the rape and murder
of Cherie Lathan,
then it's facilitation.

538
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,335
So, how do
we prove that?

539
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,032
I have to make
a deal with the Devil.

540
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,435
You give me Billings
and I'II take the death
penalty off the table.

541
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,105
Not good enough.

542
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,378
He sees Iight at the end
of the tunnel or
he doesn't talk.

543
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,617
Fine, murder two,
depending on what
Tommy has to offer.

544
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,227
When would I get out?

545
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,132
CABOT: Twenty-five years.

546
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,005
AII right.

547
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,009
When did you start
receiving e-mails
from Excel?

548
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,641
In January,
right after I
got out of jail.

549
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:30,154
They just sent ads
for websites at first.

550
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,382
Usually they
included samples.

551
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,852
Were you tempted?
Yes.

552
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,728
But I didn't give in,
not till they sent a preview
of The Story of Janet.

553
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,234
It was just a few Iines
and a photo of this girl
dressed Iike a princess.

554
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,675
It was just so...exciting.

555
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,635
So you signed up
for the website?

556
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,679
Yeah.

557
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,945
And I read the whole story,
and I saw the pictures.

558
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,783
And I wanted my body
to feel the way it used to.

559
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,382
But because of chemical
castration, you couldn't
become aroused, right?

560
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:10,820
Yeah.

561
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,929
So the next day
I ordered the testosterone.

562
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,941
You can't just come
barging in here.

563
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,237
Sure we can.
We're arresting you.

564
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,608
For what?
Facilitating the murder
of Cherie Lathan.

565
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,737
You're joking.

566
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,747
Does it Iook Iike
I'm Iaughing.
Why don't you turn around?

567
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,077
You have the right
to remain silent.

568
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,880
Anything you say, can and
will be used against you
in a court of Iaw.

569
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,147
You have the right...

570
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,083
CABOT: I'm telling you.
This is a tough case.
I could easily Iose.

571
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,524
Stanley Billings
is the reason
this happened.

572
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,256
Maybe. But the facilitation
charge against him is a reach.

573
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,957
And no matter what we do,
the defense is going to say

574
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,932
we're trying to
stifle free speech.

575
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,468
Free speech? Okay.

576
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:56,405
Free speech,
Cherie Lathan's Iife.
I don't see the contest.

577
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,566
MOREDOCK: AIex.

578
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,439
Barry. Hi.

579
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,209
EIIiot, I'd Iike for you
to meet my old Iaw professor,
Barry Moredock.

580
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,748
How are you?
Barry, this is
Detective EIIiot Stabler.

581
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,374
Detective.
What are you
doing here?

582
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,748
We're doing
business together.

583
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:08,945
What do you mean?

584
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,317
Stanley Billings.

585
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,917
Don't tell me
you're representing him.

586
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,358
I see the First
Amendment under attack,
I Ieap to its defense.

587
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,192
But I was kind of surprised
to see you're the attacker.

588
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,994
Your client's kiddie porn
is the reason a 9-year-old
girl was murdered.

589
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,628
A convicted sex offender
killed that poor girl,
Detective.

590
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,037
My client merely exercised
his right to free speech.

591
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,338
US v. Barnett.
Publishing instructions
designed to aid another

592
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,672
in the commission
of a criminal offense

593
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,736
is not protected
by the First Amendment.

594
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,908
Very good, but all
my client published

595
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,680
was a work of virtual
pornography protected
by the Supreme Court itself.

596
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,246
Billings is a sleaze bag
who turns women
into Iittle girls.

597
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,723
He makes a mockery
of the Iaw.

598
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,386
Jurisprudence has to evolve
with the technology.

599
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,487
This is gonna be
a great fight, AIex.

600
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,532
I'm glad I taught
you so well.

601
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,467
You also taught me
res ipsa Ioquitur.
"The thing speaks for itself."

602
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,903
If it Iooks Iike kiddie porn
and smells Iike kiddie porn,
it is kiddie porn.

603
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,806
Maybe it's you
who should evolve
with technology, AIex.

604
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,106
There was no kid
in the kiddie porn.

605
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,646
The victim died
by asphyxiating
on her own vomit.

606
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,584
CABOT: How did that happen?

607
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:21,023
She couldn't remove her gag
because her hands
were tied behind her.

608
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,686
The People's exhibit 12.

609
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:28,631
Dr. Warner, is this how
the victim was tied up
at the moment of her death?

610
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,894
Yes.

611
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,493
And are these restraints
the same as
the bondage methods

612
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,061
depicted in
Excel Entertainment's
The Story of Janet,

613
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,802
which Tommy Hedges
downloaded onto his computer?

614
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,036
WARNER: They're identical.

615
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,376
Body position,
placement of Iigatures,
use of a Iatex ball-gag,

616
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,975
even the multifold,
overhand knot
tying the ankles.

617
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,713
So, in your professional
opinion, Dr. Warner,

618
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,586
did Tommy Hedges
copy the website photo?

619
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,352
In every detail.

620
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,760
No further questions.

621
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,427
Dr. Warner,
remind me
what killed Cherie.

622
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,437
She asphyxiated
on her own vomit.

623
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,633
So she wasn't choked
by a photograph?

624
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,766
No.

625
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:15,802
She wasn't
kidnapped by a story?

626
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,938
No.

627
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:21,475
Or bound and gagged
by a website?

628
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,311
No.

629
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,818
Thank you.
No further questions.

630
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,821
CABOT: Mr. Hedges,
why did you kill
Cherie Lathan?

631
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,800
I never meant to.

632
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,536
Did you mean
to rape her?

633
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,365
Yes.

634
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,703
Why?

635
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,473
Because I couldn't stop
thinking about being
with a Iittle girl.

636
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,578
You are a convicted
sex offender,
and you were sentenced

637
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,713
to chemical castration
to control your sexual urges.

638
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,424
Did it work?

639
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,451
Yes, for over two years.

640
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,961
When did those
impulses begin again?

641
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,935
After I got out of jail,
I started receiving
e-mails from Cyberloves

642
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,565
advertising their
child porn stories.

643
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,336
CABOT: What sort of e-mails?

644
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,604
They'd show a photo
of a young girl,

645
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,172
and they invited me
to find out more about her.

646
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,478
So, you signed up?

647
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,540
No.

648
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,319
I ignored them,
but the e-mails kept coming.

649
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,922
I tried so hard
not to Iook.

650
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,718
Then why did you?

651
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,065
Because they kept saying,
"She's waiting for you.

652
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,298
"Give her what
she really wants."

653
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,139
It Iit a fire in my head.

654
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,508
I couldn't think
about anything else.

655
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,050
So, you bought the story?

656
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,617
Yes. The Story of Janet.

657
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:09,750
And did you copy that story
when you tied up and raped
Cherie Lathan?

658
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,457
Yes.

659
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,203
It told me
exactly what to do.

660
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,037
CABOT: Nothing further.

661
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,809
Mr. Hedges,
you were convicted
in FIorida in 1999

662
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,817
for the sexual abuse
of a 13-year-old girl.

663
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,413
Is that correct?

664
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,579
Yes.

665
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,818
Did a story
make you do that?

666
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,392
No.

667
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,397
How about when you
abducted and sexually abused

668
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,161
a 10-year-old in
California in 1995?

669
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,134
Another story to blame?

670
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,470
No.

671
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,441
What about the very
first time you were
attracted to young girls?

672
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,374
Was that inspired by porn?

673
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,537
I don't know.

674
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,580
Or have you simply been
attracted to young girls

675
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,639
for as Iong as
you can remember?

676
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,309
I don't know.

677
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,514
Mr. Hedges, aren't you
desperately trying to blame

678
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,149
someone else for
your own depravity?

679
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:20,096
They kept sending me e-mails
when I was trying to control
my feelings.

680
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,689
Yes. So you've said.

681
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,401
But tell me.

682
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,832
Tommy,

683
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,639
did you enjoy
kidnapping Cherie?

684
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,739
Yes.

685
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,210
During that time,

686
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,948
did you have second thoughts
about what you were doing?

687
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,618
Yes.

688
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:53,596
MOREDOCK: You knew
it was wrong, but still
you raped and killed her.

689
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,460
Yes.

690
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,068
Whose fault is that?

691
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:07,769
Mine.

692
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,149
Thank you.

693
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,659
I have children myself,
so the Iast thing I want

694
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,723
is for a child to participate
in the making of pornography.

695
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,032
That's why
we began Cyberloves.

696
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:39,043
To make a non-exploitative,
Iegal product for people
with youth preferences.

697
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,270
You mean pedophiles.

698
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:45,407
A small percentage
of our clientele might
have those predilections.

699
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:49,579
Then what made Tommy Hedges
act on those predilections
after viewing your product?

700
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,690
I'm afraid I wouldn't know
what motivates a murderer.

701
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,454
Do you make any effort at all

702
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,690
to suppress the marketing
of your virtual porn
to sex offenders?

703
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:05,566
We market our product
to individuals over 21
who enjoy adult entertainment.

704
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,036
CABOT: Do you call
child rape entertainment?

705
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,236
It isn't against the Iaw
to explore the dark side
of human nature.

706
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:18,545
Mr. Billings, would you agree
the purpose of pornography
is to cause sexual arousal?

707
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,248
Yes.

708
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,583
And would you agree
that the purpose of
violent pornography

709
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,520
is to eroticize violence?

710
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,293
It can have
that effect.

711
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:33,361
So it would seem Iogical
that the purpose of
violent child pornography

712
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,958
is to arouse
violent sexual feelings
towards children.

713
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:41,664
I don't know the research
on child pornography
because I don't produce it.

714
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,673
You produce images
of child abuse.

715
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,575
I produce virtual pornography
that provides a safe release,

716
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,206
so the user can
satiate his fantasies
without abusing anyone.

717
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,842
The truth of the matter
is you don't care
what your customers do

718
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,284
as Iong as they continue
to pay for your porn.

719
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,719
Objection.

720
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,951
Nothing further.

721
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,049
The defense rests,
Your Honor.

722
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,391
Counsel approach.
Mr. Billings,
you may sit down.

723
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:13,561
Ms. Cabot is nowhere near
meeting the burden of proof,
Your Honor.

724
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,369
Even if the jury convicts
for emotional reasons,

725
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,171
I'II ask the court
to follow the Iaw

726
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,212
and render a not
guilty judgment.

727
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,077
I agree with Mr. Moredock.

728
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,173
Unless you can prove
the defendant had
prior knowledge

729
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,377
that Mr. Hedges was Iikely
to commit a crime,

730
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,512
I'II have to dismiss
this case with prejudice.

731
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,489
You've got
until tomorrow.

732
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,650
We're in recess.

733
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,953
(BANGS GAVEL)

734
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,327
Tough day?

735
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,591
Yeah.

736
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,359
If I don't find
a smoking gun,
I'm screwed.

737
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,905
We've been Iooking, AIex,
we can't find what
isn't there.

738
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,907
Billings is a businessman.

739
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,000
He would do anything
to increase his profits.

740
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,875
I don't believe
he e-mailed sex offenders
by accident.

741
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,414
But if he spammed
the Internet,

742
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,244
odds are he's gonna
find a few freaks.

743
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,046
BARTENDER: You want
what the Iady's having?

744
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,821
I'II have ginger ale,
thanks.

745
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,123
As the wise man said,
I can resist everything
except temptation.

746
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,420
What did I say?

747
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,633
Hedges said
he tried to resist.

748
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,627
I wonder just how
much he was tempted.

749
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:24,935
How many times did Excel
e-mail you advertisements
for their porn?

750
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,801
I don't know.

751
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,276
Think, Tommy,
how many?

752
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,973
I don't know.
Maybe 50 or 60.

753
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,275
But you only
opened one?

754
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,509
Yeah.

755
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,744
Okay, what did you do
with the other ones?

756
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,480
I deleted them.

757
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,022
Did you ever ask Excel
to stop e-mailing you?

758
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,456
Yeah, I did.
I started selecting
the opt out option.

759
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,049
"Opt out"?
What's that?

760
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,788
It sends an e-mail back
to the company telling them

761
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,729
to take you off
their mailing Iist,
but it didn't work.

762
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,493
The e-mails kept coming.

763
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,805
My company employs
over 200 people

764
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,704
to deal with the thousands
who use our website.

765
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:03,873
You can't expect me to know
that one employee accidentally
overlooked a client's request.

766
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,645
21 times in a row
is not an accident,
it's a policy.

767
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:12,121
You bombarded a dangerous man
with provocative images
until he finally gave in.

768
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,250
That's a good try, AIex,

769
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:21,321
but a computerized oversight
is a Iong way from being
a smoking gun.

770
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:25,460
And, in case you've forgotten,
aggressive advertising isn't
against the Iaw.

771
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,498
Fine.

772
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,699
We'II just see what
the jury has to say.

773
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:41,078
I won't tell you
I Iike what my client
does for a Iiving.

774
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,817
I abhor it.

775
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,346
But I will defend his right
to publish pornography

776
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:51,794
because the protection
of free speech is vital
to our constitution.

777
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:56,559
The People have
made a great deal
out of a handful

778
00:38:56,634 --> 00:39:01,731
of automated e-mail opt outs
Mr. Hedges sent
to Excel Entertainment.

779
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,832
But has she shown
one shred of proof

780
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,742
that my client
had any knowledge
of these messages?

781
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,643
No, she has not.

782
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,249
Stanley Billings
published a story,

783
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,683
a work of the imagination,

784
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:21,089
a work which
the Supreme Court
has ruled is perfectly Iegal.

785
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,687
Mr. Billings did
not know Mr. Hedges.

786
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,955
He did not know what
Mr. Hedges might do.

787
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:33,834
Therefore, he cannot be
held responsible for what
Mr. Hedges did.

788
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,968
The Iaw holds
my client innocent.

789
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,407
So must you.

790
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,675
Thank you.

791
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,787
There is no doubt
that Tommy Hedges
killed Cherie Lathan,

792
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,715
but Stanley Billings
played a part
in her death also.

793
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,456
Now each of you knows
that he is morally guilty.

794
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,865
The question you
have to ask yourselves

795
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,332
is if he is
Iegally guilty as well.

796
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,931
And the answer is yes.

797
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,099
Stanley Billings
put a deadly weapon
in Tommy Hedges' hands,

798
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,803
and Tommy Hedges
asked him to stop.

799
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,781
Not once,
not a handful of times,
but 21 times.

800
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,145
And 21 times,
Stanley Billings ignored him.

801
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,146
Now as chief executive officer
of Excel Entertainment,

802
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:31,217
he is responsible for
his company's actions
and his company's inaction.

803
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,156
And when Hedges finally
succumbed to Billings'
hard-sell tactics,

804
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:40,499
Billings sold him instructions
on how to stalk,
kidnap and rape a child.

805
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,029
That makes Stanley Billings
an accomplice to rape,

806
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,838
and it makes him
a facilitator of murder.

807
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,183
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

808
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,082
We have, Your Honor.

809
00:40:56,153 --> 00:41:00,317
We find the defendant,
Stanley Billings,
guilty of facilitation

810
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,586
in the murder
of Cherie Lathan.

811
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,922
(SPECTATORS GASPING)

812
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,425
(SIGHS)

813
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,157
They can't be serious.
I didn't do anything.

814
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,598
Okay, Stanley.
Take it easy.

815
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:11,794
Okay, but I'm innocent.

816
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,029
MOREDOCK: It's okay.

817
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,997
Here she is now.

818
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,669
AIex. Congratulations.

819
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:21,904
You're happy?

820
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,312
Why not? I'II get
the conviction
overturned on appeal.

821
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,350
Enjoy it while you can.

822
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,410
You got the bad guy,
and you didn't stomp
on the constitution.

823
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,649
I couldn't have
taught you better myself.

824
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,420
Yeah, well, thousands
of people are still Iegally
viewing virtual child porn,

825
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,861
so maybe the constitution
could use some stomping.

826
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,127
Thousands of people
are protesting
the war and burning flags,

827
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,862
you want to
stomp on them, too?

828
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,302
Where would it
all end, AIex?

829
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:49,999
Don't be upset.

830
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:53,009
In this case,
everybody won.

831
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,738
Not Cherie Lathan.
