1
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:25,139
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:28,873
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

3
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:30,079
In New York City,

4
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,726
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:36,637
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,149
These are their stories.

7
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:42,634
Lisa, Ira, look a little bit
towards me. Okay?

8
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,851
You know what, Lisa, turn
a little bit more towards Ira.

9
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:46,604
How much longer is this
going to take, Leo?

10
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:48,230
Just a sec.
Just a sec.

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,188
I order pink headpieces for
the flower girls, they deliver white.

12
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:53,610
- How could they screw that up?
- Try to relax.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,428
They would have looked better
if I'd made them myself.

14
00:00:55,428 --> 00:00:58,289
Okay. Everybody look towards
me and smile.

15
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,665
Good.

16
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:01,582
What the hell?

17
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:03,486
Help me.

18
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,539
- How is he?
- Unconscious.

19
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:19,633
Ten people saw the victim and
no one else come out that door.

20
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,308
- Any I.D.?
- Not yet. Who was here first?

21
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:25,194
Me. On foot, post around the corner
when I heard the call.

22
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:26,178
He say anything?

23
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:29,189
Something about getting it on upstairs,
before he conked out.

24
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,039
They had one just like it last week,
a couple having sex, she whacks him...

25
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,413
Yeah, we're gonna need
the 61 on that.

26
00:01:34,897 --> 00:01:38,857
Name's Thomas Dowd, 21,
address in Queens.

27
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:42,739
I.D., credit cards
still there, no cash.

28
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:43,725
Where'd you find it?

29
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:46,644
Upstairs, the real party
was in his room.

30
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:50,903
Coat, shirt, shoes, pants,
underwear, bed.

31
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,713
Didn't waste any time with small talk.

32
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:53,891
So, they are going at it.

33
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:56,572
She grabs the ashtray,
whacks him over the head.

34
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:58,882
He falls out of the bed.

35
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:02,729
Probably got hit again,
crawls out for his life.

36
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,710
I'd say Mr. Dowd picked himself up
a pro, got rolled.

37
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,813
Find any fluids?

38
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:08,147
We were just about to look.

39
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:09,913
- Ready, Charlie?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:11,144
Show time.

41
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,110
Man, it's everywhere.

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,070
Don't people have sex
in bed anymore?

43
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,391
Apparently our victim did.
Check the sheets.

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,634
The earth moved.

45
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:26,490
Then he saw stars.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/03/23

59
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,065
We canvassed the floor.

60
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,393
These folks may have
heard something.

61
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:20,763
Hi, I'm Detective Benson.

62
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:22,369
This is my partner,
Detective Stabler.

63
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,300
Joe and Amanda Woodward
from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,223
Our friends warned us
to be careful here.

65
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:28,336
We came out of the elevator
on our way to our room,

66
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:29,575
when we heard
someone screaming.

67
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:31,211
Yeah, it sounded like a woman.

68
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,102
What time?

69
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:34,257
We went to the matinee
and then had dinner,

70
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,107
so it had to be 8:30.

71
00:03:36,107 --> 00:03:37,935
You have any idea where
the screams came from?

72
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,425
We couldn't tell
from where we were.

73
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:40,665
We called security.

74
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:43,726
Yeah, they came right away,
but it stopped.

75
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:46,769
They said there was...
It was someone's TV set.

76
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,533
You see anybody coming or going?

77
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,781
No. Nobody.
The hallway was empty.

78
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:53,092
This kind of thing happen
a lot around here?

79
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:54,973
City's never been safer.

80
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,114
- Enjoy the rest of your stay.
- Okay. Thank you.

81
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:00,156
The room was in Mr. Dowd's name.

82
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,032
Were you here when
Mr. Dowd checked in?

83
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:05,155
He registered just before 8:00.

84
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:07,063
Yes, I would have been here.

85
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,574
Was he alone?

86
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:10,672
I don't personally check guests in.

87
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:12,891
You are welcome to ask
the clerk who registered him.

88
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:14,819
We'll need to talk to all the clerks
who were on duty

89
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,844
and get copies
of your security tapes.

90
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:18,887
We'll also need the names
of your guests.

91
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,809
- On that floor?
- All the guests.

92
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,972
Who's adjacent to Mr. Dowd?

93
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,983
Both rooms were vacant.

94
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,916
It's the off-season.

95
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,139
What's all this?

96
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:34,605
Asbestos testing.

97
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:37,653
It's in every building
constructed before 1970.

98
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,168
I am not staying in here with all those tiny
cancer-causing particles flying around.

99
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:42,072
Stop worrying.

100
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:45,617
As an African-American you're statistically
far more likely to die of diabetes,

101
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,385
high blood pressure
or heart disease.

102
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:48,611
Or a bullet.

103
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,439
All right, where are we?

104
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,010
Checking the guest list
and waiting on the DNA.

105
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,615
Turns out that Thomas Dowd
was victim number two.

106
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:58,040
Victim number one was
a businessman from St. Louis.

107
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,417
Picked up a woman named
Samantha last week at the Midtown Arms.

108
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,460
They go up to his room,
they have sex

109
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,365
after which she buries
a telephone receiver into his head.

110
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:09,841
Cash was stolen, wallet
and I.D. left behind.

111
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:12,376
- We talk to this guy?
- Yeah. He hung up on me.

112
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:14,129
He said that his wife
was in the next room.

113
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:16,303
So, we got a pro who likes
to get violent.

114
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:17,492
Maybe.

115
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,859
One thing stood out on the 61.

116
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:22,977
Here it is. "Victim says assailant wanted
him to get rough with her...

117
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:24,795
"he got nervous."
"He tried to leave."

118
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:26,007
That's when she crowned him.

119
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:29,230
So, she's leaving a trail of bloody men
at high-end hotels.

120
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,082
This case has vice written all over it.

121
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,641
Rule out a bona fide sex crime,
I will hand the file to them myself.

122
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:36,112
Great. Thank you.

123
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:39,127
Let's see what Thomas Dowd says.
He woke up an hour ago.

124
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,338
Providence Hospital
226 East 21st Street
Monday, February 26

125
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:45,200
On his way home, gets mugged
and beaten in the streets.

126
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,795
Mam, please.

127
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:49,197
Right on 5th avenue.
Nobody's safe.

128
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:52,781
Mrs. Dowd, we just need
a few minutes alone with Tommy.

129
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:58,804
- I'll go get a cup of tea.
- Thank you.

130
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,835
You told your Mom
you were mugged.

131
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:09,369
You think I want her to know
I was in a hotel room with some woman?

132
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,288
Where did you pick up
your date?

133
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:14,047
In the bar at the Decameron.

134
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,767
My buddy Frank was...

135
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:19,115
supposed to meet me there
for a few beers and the Knick game.

136
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:20,515
Why the Decameron?

137
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:22,037
Frank suggested it.

138
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:25,028
Doesn't like the smoke
in the sports bars.

139
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,650
Didn't matter.
He never showed.

140
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,151
But you stayed?

141
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:30,453
I didn't want to miss tip-off.

142
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,840
I am sitting there,
she comes over to me.

143
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,403
Real nice-looking.

144
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:38,259
- Name?
- Jill.

145
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,408
Jill. And...

146
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,136
how much did Jill want?

147
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,194
It wasn't like that.

148
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:47,186
We start talking.
We hit it off.

149
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:49,385
She suggests we go upstairs.

150
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:51,766
So I go to the front desk and register.

151
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,667
And? Then what?

152
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,644
She says she's a little shy.

153
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:58,885
I should give her the key,
wait five minutes and follow her up.

154
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,062
I get up there, open the door,

155
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,797
she's waiting in bed for me.

156
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,048
Yeah, we saw your trail of clothes.
You two didn't waste much time.

157
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:08,718
I get in there and she grabs me,

158
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:12,747
pulls me on top of her
and we go at it like there's no tomorrow.

159
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,884
Next thing I know,

160
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:19,977
some guy in a tuxedo is
standing over me in the lobby.

161
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:22,065
Can you describe Jill?

162
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:25,192
Blonde...

163
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,155
buff...

164
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,730
Iooked like she was in her thirties.

165
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,757
We will have a computer sketch
artist come on down.

166
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:32,692
Did she say anything to you?

167
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:35,470
She wanted me to fight her for it.

168
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,530
Said she liked it rough.

169
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,463
So I went along.

170
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:43,074
Did she at any time
tell you to stop it?

171
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:46,402
She told me to slap her harder,
make it hurt.

172
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:49,049
I said that's not my scene, but...

173
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:51,644
she wouldn't take no
for an answer.

174
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:56,759
Maybe Jill has second thoughts
when guys fight too hard.

175
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,643
She picked both men up at hotel bars.

176
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:00,646
Let's see if the bartenders
remember her.

177
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,908
Yeah, he was here.

178
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,942
Nursed the same drink for an hour
and forgot to leave a tip.

179
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,534
Anyone here with him?

180
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:09,891
Some blonde.

181
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,243
- Didn't hang out long, though.
- How long?

182
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,698
Five minutes, tops.

183
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:16,362
He hands her a room key.
She leaves.

184
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,057
He heads out
a few minutes later.

185
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:19,903
That's not a lot of
get-to-know-you time.

186
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:22,209
He ever step away
from the bar before that?

187
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,578
If he did, I missed it

188
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:26,417
What time did they hook up?

189
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,836
8:30.

190
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:30,191
End of the first quarter
of the Knicks game.

191
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:34,157
You must know some of the local
businesswomen who hang out here.

192
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:35,628
She wasn't one of them.

193
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,226
But I've seen him here before.

194
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,550
Alone?

195
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,807
Always with a different woman.

196
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,271
Good looking young guy
like him, I don't get it.

197
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,504
Get what?

198
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:48,928
Some of his dates are
old enough to be his mother.

199
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:53,255
What's up, Doc?

200
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,622
I am not taking any chances.

201
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:56,224
They haven't done anything yet.

202
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,300
This is out of control.

203
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,339
Where's my desk?

204
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,585
I'm having the desks moved out
into the hallway.

205
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:04,089
All right, everybody upstairs.
Grab your case files.

206
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:05,934
Olivia, what've you got?

207
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:08,203
Tommy Dowd lied to us.

208
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:10,393
He already had the hotel room
when he met our Jill.

209
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:12,352
Bartender says Tommy was
hanging with women

210
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,768
who had 20 years on him.

211
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:17,017
So, either he's got an Oedipus complex
or he's the pro.

212
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:20,727
You should run him through the computer
before you go back to see him.

213
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,699
One arrest, prostitution.

214
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,744
What really happened last night?

215
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,449
Cut out the games, Tommy

216
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:32,770
and start separating out fact
from fiction for us, okay?

217
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,010
Client offered me $1,000
to sleep with her.

218
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,933
How'd she find you?

219
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,873
I work for an escort service.

220
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,540
It's legitimate.
I needed the money.

221
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,941
What for?

222
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,452
For my mother.

223
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:54,727
Come on. You're gonna have to
do better than that.

224
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,125
It's the truth.

225
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,775
My father died last year.

226
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,431
I go to City University.

227
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:04,552
I had to drop out to help Mom run our
dry-cleaning store out in Elmhurst.

228
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,745
Dad liked to play the ponies.

229
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:09,215
We didn't know how much
until after he was gone.

230
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:10,786
So he left you in debt?

231
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:13,651
We lost the store,
almost lost the house.

232
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:15,063
And you moonlight as a pro.

233
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:16,847
Escort. Walker.

234
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,736
Rent-a-date for the over-50 set.

235
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,878
Take them out and make sure
they don't fall asleep.

236
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:22,424
Lot's of guys do it in college.

237
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:23,685
They need the money, too?

238
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:25,090
$600 an hour,

239
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,090
minimum three-and-a-half-hour date,
we take home 40%.

240
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,166
You are almost guaranteed
$1,000 a night.

241
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,363
Any of them get arrested for prostitution?

242
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:36,244
Client offers me an extra $500 cash
to spend the night,

243
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,553
how do I know she's a cop?

244
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,222
Didn't stop you from doing it again.

245
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,772
- Last night?
- Yeah.

246
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,573
Jill offered me an extra $1,000.

247
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:46,595
Look, none of this changes
what happened to me.

248
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:50,238
It does if you forced Jill
to have sex.

249
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:53,833
I did what she wanted.
I didn't rape her.

250
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:56,626
I don't know what set her off.

251
00:10:57,398 --> 00:10:59,720
Man About Town Escort Service
26 West 15th Street
Tuesday, February 27

252
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,860
Tommy's one of my most
requested escorts.

253
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,790
Witty, charming, down-to-earth.

254
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,902
The ladies love him because
he's not just arm candy.

255
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:07,434
You ever have complaints about him?

256
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,827
He wouldn't be working here
if there were.

257
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:12,801
Do you employ a lot
of college kids like Tommy?

258
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:13,885
It's a win-win.

259
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,274
I get the handsome,
nice young men my clients want...

260
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:17,612
And they get 40%?

261
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:22,056
My clients are among the wealthiest
and most influential women in New York.

262
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,299
Widows or women whose husbands
travel for business...

263
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,051
who don't want
to be seen out alone.

264
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:31,206
My escorts accompany them to
the theater, opera, museums, parties.

265
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:32,763
Good deal for a college student.

266
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:36,334
They are exposed to culture and class
while providing companionship.

267
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,018
What about sexual favors?

268
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,363
Do your escorts provide that?

269
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:44,839
I find out about it,
I fire the escort and drop the client.

270
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,995
Reputation is everything
in my business.

271
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,428
You are not saying Tommy...

272
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:52,216
We are not implying anything,
it's just part of our investigation.

273
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:56,015
Here it is. Hotel Decameron, 8:00,

274
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,177
wedding escort.

275
00:11:58,775 --> 00:11:59,921
And the client's name?

276
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,940
Jill Lessard. A first-timer.

277
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,671
Okay, thank you.

278
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:09,447
Yeah, thanks.

279
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:10,741
That was the hotel.

280
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:13,055
No one named Lessard on
the wedding invitation list.

281
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:15,532
Perp could've got that off
the list of events at the lobby.

282
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:18,005
- Yeah, I am still here.
- What about security tapes?

283
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,011
Midtown Arms recycles
after one week.

284
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:23,026
The camera on the fifth floor
of the Decameron wasn't working.

285
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:24,300
Yeah. All right.

286
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,706
Jill Lessard was 1,000 miles
away from here two nights ago.

287
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,429
- Where?
- Kewanee, Illinois.

288
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:30,921
Hog capital of the world.
(ÄÉ¿Í´Ï ½ÃÀÇ º°¸í)

289
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:32,631
Somebody stole
her credit card number,

290
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:35,308
then used it to book
the escort at Man About Town.

291
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:39,420
So our perp's racked up
one identity theft and two assaults.

292
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,959
Make that three.

293
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:45,837
Beaumont Hotel
606 West 48th Street
Tuesday, February 27

294
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:48,089
What have we got?

295
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,059
Unidentified male, looks mid-twenties

296
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:52,931
was wearing a condom
when hotel security found him.

297
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,335
The perp picked
the whole wallet this time. / Deja vu.

298
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:57,535
Right down to the victim.
Another pretty boy.

299
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:58,660
You find anything else?

300
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,671
Tonight's weapon of choice.

301
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,460
Just had to reach over
to the night stand.

302
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,349
She do as much damage to the victim?

303
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,914
He's in dreamland.
EMS rushed him out of here.

304
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:09,641
They said it's likely he'll die.

305
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:12,621
I will bet my vacation we've
got another escort.

306
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:19,876
We ran his prints.

307
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:22,750
Name is Victor Coe, 26,
address on Riverside Drive.

308
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,420
Three arrests for prostitution.

309
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,321
We showed a sketch of Jill
to the bartender at the Beaumont.

310
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:29,214
He I.D.'d her as Coe's companion.

311
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:31,833
Bartender also saw the foreplay.
He passes her the key,

312
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,104
then waits five minutes
before he follows her up.

313
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,724
Coe still likely to die?

314
00:13:35,724 --> 00:13:38,309
He's been upgraded to critical,
but he can go either way.

315
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:40,517
The businessman she picked up
from St. Louis

316
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:42,173
wouldn't play into her fantasies.

317
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:45,884
So, she buys herself some escorts
thinking the customer is always right.

318
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:47,273
They will do whatever she wants.

319
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,060
Perp got Dowd from
Man About Town.

320
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,433
Bet she got Coe from there, too.

321
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:53,052
Pay Leslie Desantis another visit.

322
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:54,431
We got a pattern here.

323
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,830
Check with NCIC, VICAP.
(NCIC: ¿¬¹æ Çü»ç Á¤º¸ ¼¾ÅÍ)
(VICAP: °­·Â ¹üÁËÀÚ üÆ÷ ÇÁ·Î±×·¥)

324
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,275
Maybe Jill played her fantasy
out in some other city

325
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:01,763
before she took her act on the road.

326
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,354
Coe have any family here?

327
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:05,097
A brother,
a high-powered art dealer.

328
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:08,190
He owns the apartment
on Riverside Drive where Victor lives.

329
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,524
Persuade him to let you
take a look around.

330
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,961
Apartment of Victor Coe
682 Riverside Drive
Wednesday, February 28

331
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,550
When did you last see Victor?

332
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,602
It's been months.

333
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:19,295
We were both too busy.

334
00:14:19,295 --> 00:14:21,690
Now he's in some hospital bed
on a bubble.

335
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,630
Nice place.
What does your brother do?

336
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,175
He's a starving actor.

337
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,649
How's he afford this?

338
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,649
I enable him.

339
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:31,181
Victor pays a little rent when he can.

340
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:34,667
It's hard to do on his income
off those off-off Broadway plays.

341
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,084
Wish I had a brother like you.

342
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,424
These chairs are Alvar Aalto, 1929.

343
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:49,099
I admire your taste.

344
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:51,098
I didn't buy any of this.

345
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:54,817
Victor had all hand-me-down
furniture the last time I was here.

346
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:58,107
Mr. Coe, were you told
how your brother was attacked?

347
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,725
No. Does it matter?

348
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:00,801
It might.

349
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,082
Victor was arrested several
times for prostitution.

350
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:05,275
My God.

351
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,771
We think whoever did this
to him was a client.

352
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:09,678
And there is a way
you can help us.

353
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:12,187
- How?
- Let us take a look around.

354
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:16,483
There could be something that lets us 
know who Victor met up with last night.

355
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,519
Where do you want to start?

356
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:21,528
I fired Victor three months ago.

357
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:22,968
Why are you asking about him?

358
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:24,428
Because he was beaten
the same way

359
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:27,390
Tommy Dowd was,
only Victor may not make it.

360
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,539
I screen my clients.
Apparently Victor didn't.

361
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,496
Your concern is overwhelming.

362
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:33,998
I treated him well.

363
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,587
He thanked me by taking money
out of my pocket.

364
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,260
Is that why you fired him?

365
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:42,560
Client complained when Victor
offered her his services

366
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,334
the whole night for $1,000 dollars.

367
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,670
I boot him, he steals my clients.

368
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,410
So, I guess you wouldn't be too sorry 
if Victor went out of business.

369
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,017
I would delight in it.
But I wouldn't hurt him.

370
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,370
Any of your rivals out to hurt you?

371
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,736
This is a competitive
business, Detective.

372
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:58,800
Not cutthroat.

373
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,130
The list from Victor Coe's Palm Pilot
is a who's who of the city's finest ladies.

374
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,331
Anybody stand out?

375
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,693
One whose husband's office
number is also tucked inside.

376
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:07,882
Claudia Baines Marshall.

377
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:10,872
Wife of Merchants Commerce
Bank chairman, Darien Marshall.

378
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:13,359
Isn't he up for some ambassadorship?

379
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:16,201
If Coe was servicing the
most prominent women in town,

380
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:18,286
then Mrs. Marshall's number
makes sense,

381
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,673
but Mr. Marshall's doesn't.

382
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:22,952
Unless Coe attached a price
to Mrs. Marshall's indiscretion.

383
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:24,241
Blackmail.

384
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,540
Coe's bank statement
from the apartment.

385
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,120
Someone wired $75,000 into his checking
account six months ago.

386
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,496
One day later,

387
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:33,945
Coe cuts Dowd a check for $5,000.

388
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,161
So Dowd could be in on this, too.

389
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,814
You two, talk to Mrs. Marshall.
You two, go talk to Mr. Marshall.

390
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:42,062
And I am sure I don't have
to tell you to tread lightly.

391
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:45,730
These people probably have their own
dresser drawer in the Lincoln bedroom.

392
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:48,742
Apartment of Darien and Claudia Marshall
1012 Fifth Avenue
Thursday, March 1

393
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,431
Can I have Inez
bring you something?

394
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,521
No, thank you.

395
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:53,445
Then how can I help you, detectives?

396
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,165
Victor Coe. Do you know him?

397
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:58,069
And if I told you I didn't?

398
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:00,331
Mister Coe was found
nearly beaten to death.

399
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:02,539
Your number in his Palm top.

400
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:06,699
- Is Victor okay?
- He's hanging on.

401
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:08,747
Why come to me?

402
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:12,063
We need to know the extent
of your relationship with Victor.

403
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,872
Is this necessary?

404
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:17,009
- If word gets out...
- It doesn't have to leave the room.

405
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,237
I've spent 30 years of my life
reassuring my husband

406
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:25,644
he was capable of becoming
the man he is.

407
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,886
I gave him children, reared them...

408
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:31,332
stood by his side through
things you can't imagine.

409
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:33,379
All I asked in return was his loyalty.

410
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:35,178
It was the one thing
he wouldn't give me.

411
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:37,364
Is that why you went to Victor?

412
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:42,229
When I found out my husband was
reassuring himself with 20-somethings

413
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,656
who stroke him like a rabbit's foot,

414
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:47,269
I decided I was entitled
to my own diversions.

415
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,963
Wouldn't your husband
have been angry if he'd found out?

416
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:51,170
No.

417
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,996
Darien knows about Victor.

418
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:56,156
Our marriage has long since disintegrated

419
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:58,596
from one of love into one of convenience.

420
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,438
He needs me, and I need him.

421
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:02,672
How did you meet Victor?

422
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:04,658
Through the escort service

423
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:08,717
after they sent several men
who were not up to par.

424
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,878
Tommy Dowd one of them?

425
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:13,044
Tommy was a child.

426
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:17,374
A nice young man,
but not terribly adventurous.

427
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:21,544
Your husband's office number
is also in Victor's computer.

428
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:24,337
- It is?
- Any idea why?

429
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,249
You'll have to ask him.

430
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,911
I have no idea how my number
got into his computer.

431
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:30,767
Did you meet Mr. Coe?

432
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:33,132
I haven't had the pleasure.

433
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,920
Talk to my wife.

434
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,128
So, you're aware of their relationship?

435
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:39,309
It must upset you.

436
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,122
Recessions upset me.

437
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,758
The collapse of the dot-com
economy upsets me.

438
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,872
My wife's dalliances do not.

439
00:18:45,872 --> 00:18:48,677
You're not concerned that
public knowledge of your wife's trysts

440
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,216
could derail your diplomatic ambitions?

441
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:54,060
Claudia wants this ambassadorship
as much as I do.

442
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,101
I have always been able
to count on her to be discreet.

443
00:18:57,101 --> 00:19:00,179
Did you pay Victor Coe so you
could count on his discretion?

444
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,396
Excuse me?

445
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:04,312
Someone transferred $75,000
into his account.

446
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:05,667
After we get the subpoena

447
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:09,141
it will only be a few hours
before we know where it came from.

448
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:12,994
Mr. Coe made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

449
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:15,362
What's your guarantee
he sticks to it?

450
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,281
A notarized confidentiality agreement.

451
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:21,710
He reveals anything in our transaction
or the details therein,

452
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,181
he has to return the money.

453
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:25,753
But if that happens, the damage to your
reputation's already done.

454
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:28,566
Maybe you wanted
a more permanent agreement.

455
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:33,242
Gentlemen, if I wanted
Victor Coe dead...

456
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:35,810
he'd be in his grave by now.

457
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:41,852
Everything's a transaction to that guy,
including his marriage.

458
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:43,597
$75,000 is pocket change.

459
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:46,854
Marshall spends at least that on lobbyists
greasing the congressional wheels

460
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,337
for his confirmation hearings.

461
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,204
Is there anything
you're not suspicious about?

462
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:52,590
No. Including what's in this hot dog.

463
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:55,266
Tutuola.

464
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:57,954
I'm on it, Captain.

465
00:19:57,954 --> 00:19:59,423
We got to pick up Tommy Dowd.

466
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:00,469
What'd he do now?

467
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:03,337
Paid off a $43,000 dollar debt
six months ago.

468
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:05,077
Maybe I should become an escort.

469
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:06,750
Don't quit your day job.

470
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:09,577
$26,000 dollars
for your mother's mortgage...

471
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:11,932
and another $17,000
for your two credit cards.

472
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:14,564
We have the $5,000 check
Victor Coe wrote you.

473
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:15,668
What are you talking about?

474
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:18,545
Wow. That whack on the head
must have given you amnesia.

475
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:21,899
You and Victor blackmailed
Darien Marshall, didn't you?

476
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:22,996
Blackmail?

477
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,558
You both slept with Marshall's wife.

478
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,171
I never slept with her.

479
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:29,258
I escorted her twice.
She asked Leslie to replace me.

480
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:32,030
So you figured you could make
a quick buck at Marshall's expense?

481
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,755
You thought it up, Victor carried it out.

482
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:36,441
- Is that how it went?
- That $5,000?

483
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,885
Victor owed it to me for bailing him
out a few times

484
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,795
when he couldn't take an assignment.

485
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:43,113
Fine. Where'd you get the rest?

486
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:46,180
My boss loaned it to me.

487
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:48,745
- Leslie Desantis?
- Yeah.

488
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:50,709
With interest?

489
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,225
I perform personal services for her.

490
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:55,360
Sex?

491
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,650
I was desperate.

492
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,385
My mother was about to lose the house.

493
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,053
I told Leslie and
she offered me the money.

494
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,302
Swore I'd pay back every cent.

495
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:05,847
She didn't tell me I had to sleep with her
until afterwards.

496
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,015
I did for a while, until Leslie
wanted me all the time.

497
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:10,517
So, what did you do?

498
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:11,750
We had a huge fight.

499
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,841
I say I am going to quit
she says she's going to call in my loan.

500
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,733
I had to stay.

501
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:20,067
So, how long ago was this?

502
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:23,646
The night before she sent
me out with Miss Fantasy.

503
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,685
Tommy dumps Leslie,
Victor steals from her.

504
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,108
They both end up in the hospital.

505
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:30,131
- She teaching them a lesson?
- Could be.

506
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:32,659
Both were hit on the back of the head.
Faces weren't touched.

507
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,266
Don't damage that merchandise, baby.

508
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:37,341
That still doesn't explain our
businessman from St. Louis.

509
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:39,099
So, maybe it's not the same perp.

510
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,833
- Maybe I can help you.
- How?

511
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,002
Vice just busted
a pro matching the sketch.

512
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,543
Clubbed her john with a baseball bat.

513
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:47,417
Bring her in for a lineup.

514
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:53,000
Do you recognize any of these women?

515
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:54,784
Number three.

516
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:56,548
- From where?
- She's a regular.

517
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,193
I've seen her with a couple of guys.

518
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,706
- Did you see her with Victor Coe?
- Come on, counselor.

519
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:03,677
Thanks for coming in.

520
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,639
Mr. Dowd, do you recognize
any of these women?

521
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:19,074
She's not there.

522
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:20,114
You barely looked.

523
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:22,414
- He said she's not there, Captain.
- We heard him.

524
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:24,354
Are you sure?

525
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:26,211
Yeah. I'm sure.

526
00:22:27,132 --> 00:22:29,464
Tommy, wait for us outside.

527
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,739
- Are we through here?
- Here, yes.

528
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:34,234
But Vice has her for assault one.

529
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:37,047
That was a bust.

530
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:38,543
Which leaves us right back
where we started.

531
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:40,593
Maybe not.
Lab just called.

532
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,710
Says they got something to show us.

533
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,173
The semen on the sheets from
the Hotel Decameron

534
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:47,688
came back as two distinct types.

535
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:49,176
She had sex with two men.

536
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:51,213
Because it's a hotel,
we can't be certain.

537
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:52,730
But check this out.

538
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,465
Look at the fingerprint
pattern on the ashtray.

539
00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:57,731
The perp's a lefty.

540
00:22:57,982 --> 00:23:01,732
All the wounds were on the left side
of the victim's head.

541
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,180
Now, I reach with my left hand
for the ashtray,

542
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,191
I am holding it like this.

543
00:23:07,191 --> 00:23:11,474
Pattern of the wounds only fit the edge of
the ashtray next to the heel of my hand.

544
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,647
- That's impossible.
- Exactly.

545
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:15,498
It's even more pronounced
with the telephone.

546
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:17,912
The attacker grabbed it with
the thumb on top of the receiver,

547
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:20,844
fingers underneath
the cradle, like this.

548
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:25,134
There's no way that she could
do that from her position underneath

549
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:27,742
and cause that wound pattern
on the left side of Victor's head.

550
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:29,867
Meaning somebody else
was in both rooms.

551
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,084
Prints on the phone and
the ashtray are identical.

552
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:33,810
So she had a partner
in her little game.

553
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,541
Judging from the second
semen stain, yes.

554
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,348
So, he saves his damsel in distress
from her would-be rapist

555
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:40,424
and then they have sex?

556
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:42,962
While the victim lays
bleeding on the floor.

557
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:45,943
What kind of fantasy is that?

558
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:52,961
CSU found prints in the closets
of both hotel rooms,

559
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:55,080
and the prints match up
with the ashtray and the phone.

560
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,295
They also found semen
in both of the closets.

561
00:23:57,295 --> 00:24:01,420
The DNA is identical to one of the two 
stains found on each of the hotel beds.

562
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,880
Whoever Jack and Jill are,
they're not in the system.

563
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,360
So Jack warms up for the big event

564
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,684
as he watches Jill
and the victim get it on.

565
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:10,960
Everybody has fantasies.
Most of them don't run amok.

566
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,728
You know, guy wants to
sleep with Miss October

567
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:15,583
his wife wants to spend 45 minutes
with the buff construction worker

568
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,388
she sees outside her office window.

569
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:18,839
Remember that case
we worked last year?

570
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:21,696
The guy had a baby fetish.
He wore diapers underneath his clothes.

571
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:24,661
We go to his place. Second bedroom 
is set up as a nursery.

572
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:26,623
Custom-built crib for four.

573
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:27,694
That's twisted.

574
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:30,119
If we're done with our trip
down memory lane,

575
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,700
can you tell me what else we have?

576
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,913
We canvassed the bellmen
and the doormen.

577
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:36,018
Nobody remembers a woman
matching the sketch.

578
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,512
We don't know what
her partner looks like.

579
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:39,641
Tommy Dowd and Victor Coe
got pretty bloodied.

580
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,983
There's no way the perps
didn't get some on themselves.

581
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:44,214
But the bathrooms weren't used.

582
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,283
Meaning they had their own room
to clean up and lay low.

583
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:49,885
- Anything on the guest lists?
- Still cross-checking.

584
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:51,094
I'll call Skoda.

585
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:53,179
If he can tell us about
this couple's pathology

586
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:55,833
maybe we can figure out
who they are.

587
00:24:57,638 --> 00:25:00,270
Ever heard the phrase 'Folie a deux'?

588
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:02,080
'Deux' is two.

589
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,249
Folie is madness.
Shared madness.

590
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,836
I tell you I see little green men
everywhere,

591
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:08,931
you love me so much,
you start seeing them, too.

592
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:10,638
That's what this is?

593
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:13,398
It's like that, except with
the sexual perversion thrown in.

594
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:15,696
We'd call it
a shared psychotic disorder.

595
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:18,488
So, I bring you into
my sexual fantasy,

596
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:19,828
and you make it your own.

597
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:22,231
She gets him to enter her delusion.

598
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:25,069
She pretends to be assaulted,

599
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:27,589
he gets to play the knight
in shining armor.

600
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:29,182
How does something
like this get started?

601
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:30,829
Probably by accident.

602
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,688
Couple's making love,

603
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:34,930
she fights him a little bit.
It excites her.

604
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,441
He fights her back,
it excites her even more.

605
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:39,545
Turns out to be the best sex
they ever had.

606
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:42,125
Until the fantasy wears thin.

607
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,424
And then they get somebody else
to play the part.

608
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:46,225
And the husband gets
to be the hero.

609
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:47,669
Maybe they start with a friend.

610
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,649
Or they pick up a businessman
from St. Louis,

611
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,154
only he doesn't want
to play along.

612
00:25:51,154 --> 00:25:53,145
So, then they turn to male escorts.

613
00:25:53,145 --> 00:25:55,322
And when the fantasy evolves?

614
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:58,481
It becomes such a part of
their sexual ritual,

615
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:00,342
it's the only way they can get aroused.

616
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:02,311
Their last victim is in a coma.

617
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,793
So, it progresses to violence.

618
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:06,564
As they sink deeper into the delusion,
the madness escalates.

619
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,276
They become addicts,

620
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,456
they need a stronger fix more often.

621
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:13,552
Listen, we are going to have
to cut this short.

622
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:14,680
What's up?

623
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,739
Maid at the Broadway Hotel
found a body in another room.

624
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:21,057
Same M.O, except this one's dead.

625
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:28,996
Broadway Hotel
1702 Broadway
Friday, March 2

626
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:34,798
This is getting old.

627
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,007
Gregory Moore, 21,
address in Peekskill.

628
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:39,595
- M.E.'s on the way.
- Murder weapon?

629
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:41,159
Crystal vase.

630
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,459
Hit him so hard,
there's brain matter on it.

631
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:45,271
Somebody must have heard that.

632
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,731
See the pointy edges?

633
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,764
Perp came down hard enough
on the victim with that,

634
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:49,903
one blow would shut him up.

635
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:52,827
I guess they wanted to make sure
that they got it right this time.

636
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,318
Lab confirms the DNA
and prints match the other two scenes.

637
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:59,581
We know what escort service
Moore worked for?

638
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:00,456
He didn't.

639
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:01,977
Moore had no record with us, either.

640
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:04,518
But his parents say he was
a student at City University.

641
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:06,539
That's where Tommy Dowd went
before he dropped out.

642
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:07,888
Half the city goes there.

643
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:09,654
I don't believe in coincidences.

644
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:11,414
Pick Tommy up.

645
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:15,712
It's too bad Tommy got
himself involved in all this.

646
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,997
He had a choice. He knew
what he was doing was wrong.

647
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:19,222
I don't know if he wanted to.

648
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:23,327
It seems like he was just trying to help
his mom save their house.

649
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:25,593
There are other ways
to make money than prostitution.

650
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:28,499
What's he going to do,
flip burgers in a fast food
joint for minimum wage?

651
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,371
Come on, Elliot, if peddling
your body is okay,

652
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:32,738
- what about selling coke?
- It's not the same thing.

653
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:33,624
What do you mean?

654
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,163
All I am saying is that we
shouldn't be worrying about

655
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:39,420
who's jumping into the sack
with who, for how much.

656
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,341
The truth is, no matter how
we feel about it,

657
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:43,646
if it's illegal, it is our business.

658
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:48,369
Leslie called yesterday afternoon.

659
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:51,067
Said she needed me right away.

660
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:53,211
Last minute booking.

661
00:27:54,723 --> 00:28:00,608
I had to meet with lawyers about the back
taxes we owe on the store.

662
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:03,832
So I called Greg...

663
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:07,363
asked him if he wanted
some easy money.

664
00:28:07,363 --> 00:28:09,346
What was the job?

665
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,635
Accompany some woman
to a Broadway premiere.

666
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:17,185
I don't know how they wound up
at that hotel.

667
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:20,025
Did Leslie know that you
were finding a substitute?

668
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:21,352
No.

669
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:24,716
Leslie doesn't know Greg.

670
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:27,405
He's a buddy from college.

671
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:31,084
He'd been bugging me
for a chance to try to be an escort.

672
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,837
Now, Tommy, you were the one
who was supposed to be out on that job.

673
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:37,268
You think that's a coincidence?

674
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,745
Leslie's all about business.

675
00:28:45,745 --> 00:28:49,632
I still owe her $28,000.
Killing me makes no sense.

676
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:52,302
It does if she thought
that you can hurt her.

677
00:28:52,302 --> 00:28:54,269
Can you?

678
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:58,323
Leslie says she runs
a legitimate escort service.

679
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:01,328
But she's really a pimp.

680
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,991
How often was sex
part of the package?

681
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,319
Client pays an extra $200 an hour,

682
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,148
she gets whatever she wants
as long as the escort's willing.

683
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:12,925
Victor Coe in on that?

684
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,104
Until he got greedy.

685
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:17,155
Decided if he was performing
the service,

686
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,031
he should keep the money himself.

687
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:22,532
Did Leslie call Victor Coe
the night he was attacked?

688
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:28,231
She told me
she couldn't find anyone else.

689
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,633
She hired him back for the night.

690
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:39,504
I can't believe she did this on purpose.

691
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:42,298
Anything?

692
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:45,879
Victor's LUDs confirmed the call from
Leslie Desantis the night of the attack.

693
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,971
We checked all three hotels'
registration lists.

694
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:49,114
No matching names.

695
00:29:49,114 --> 00:29:51,052
You think Desantis knows
who these people are?

696
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,503
Maybe she helps them
fulfill their fantasies.

697
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:55,404
Pimps don't just supply client lists.

698
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:58,201
They are supposed to provide protection
and screen out the freaks.

699
00:29:58,201 --> 00:30:01,148
So you think she intentionally
sent her escorts to the slaughter?

700
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:03,797
She sent Tommy Dowd
to these people twice.

701
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:05,282
I think she knew what she was doing.

702
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,890
That's not enough to arrest her.
It's enough for a search warrant.

703
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,438
But you serve it and she's tipped off.

704
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:12,872
You're left with pimping and
one uncorroborated statement
from a co-conspirator.

705
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:16,197
Any suggestions, counselor?
We're open to them.

706
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:18,315
Maybe Tommy Dowd will agree
to wear a wire.

707
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:19,865
We have nothing to offer him.

708
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:21,729
Except the chance
to do the right thing...

709
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:25,085
especially if he feels
he's responsible for his friend's death.

710
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:28,158
I'm not wearing a wire.

711
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:30,284
Leslie killed your friend, Tommy.

712
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:32,382
She tried to kill you twice.

713
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:34,014
You have no proof.

714
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:36,497
You argued with her,
you got beaten up.

715
00:30:36,497 --> 00:30:39,498
Your friend Victor stole from her,
and now he's in a coma.

716
00:30:39,498 --> 00:30:42,192
That doesn't mean she knows
who this couple is.

717
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:44,672
Leslie expected you to be in
that hotel room,

718
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,971
not your friend Gregory.

719
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:49,909
If we don't stop her,
she's going to kill someone else.

720
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,649
Empire Apartments
1331 Second Avenue
Monday, March 5

721
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:58,183
Water's almost ready.

722
00:30:58,183 --> 00:30:59,828
I'll get the linguine.

723
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:02,980
What's wrong with you tonight?
You seem so quiet.

724
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:06,910
Say something, Tommy.

725
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:08,769
Greg's dead.

726
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,682
Thank God it wasn't you.

727
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:12,912
He was supposed to escort
a woman to the theatre.

728
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,549
Not to the Broadway Hotel.

729
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:16,959
Client wants you to spend the night
it's part of the job.

730
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,552
You get well paid for it.

731
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:21,429
Getting bludgeoned
isn't part of the job.

732
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:23,997
Greg's dead,
Victor's still in a coma.

733
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,745
I am sorry about your friend.

734
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:27,932
As for Victor,
he got what he deserved.

735
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:29,665
- Got her.
- What about me?

736
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:32,231
I never meant for you to get hurt.

737
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:34,417
You think I wouldn't
protect my investment?

738
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:37,382
- Come over here.
- I'm not in the mood.

739
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,487
What is this?

740
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:41,198
It's my walkman.

741
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:43,220
- She found it.
- Let's move.

742
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:47,675
You ungrateful little bastard!

743
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:49,175
Go! Open it! Go!

744
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:51,132
Police.

745
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:53,998
Show me your hands!

746
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,509
SVU, detail, 10-54.
We've got severe burns.

747
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:04,657
Rush a bus and notify the burn unit.

748
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:07,236
You know, murdering a witness
is a death penalty crime.

749
00:32:07,236 --> 00:32:09,889
- He dies, so do you.
- Screw you.

750
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,718
Hang in there, Tommy.
You hang in there.

751
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,784
How bad is he?

752
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:25,267
Second degree burns on
head, neck, face, arms and hands.

753
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:26,362
Why did she do it?

754
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,044
She discovered the wire.

755
00:32:28,044 --> 00:32:29,615
Couldn't get to him fast enough.

756
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,291
- What do we tell her?
- I'm working on it.

757
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:35,443
Mrs. Dowd, this is our boss,
Captain Cragen

758
00:32:35,443 --> 00:32:37,668
and the Assistant
District Attorney, Cabot.

759
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:40,010
We cannot tell you how sorry
we are about this.

760
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,522
How did it happen?

761
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:44,962
Your son was helping us
in the investigation into who attacked him.

762
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,830
- He volunteered to...
- You allowed Tommy to do this?

763
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,542
We felt it was the only way...

764
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:49,881
You should have
found another way.

765
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,753
We have the person who hurt him.

766
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:53,763
And she's being charged
with attempted murder.

767
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,729
If my son survives, I am sure
he will be glad to hear that.

768
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:58,821
Who approved this?

769
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,650
I did.

770
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:05,164
Mrs. Dowd, I am...

771
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:07,470
Look what you did to him.

772
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,860
What do you want us to do?

773
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,628
I need your fives typed and ready
before the inquisition begins.

774
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:30,898
Riker's island
Tuesday, March 6

775
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:32,582
I am sorry about your friend.

776
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:35,486
As for Victor,
he got what he deserved.

777
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:38,786
They're just words.

778
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:41,151
Which establish a motive
for the attack on Victor Coe.

779
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:42,288
You can't prove intent.

780
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:43,619
- Can't I?
- No.

781
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:44,821
Tommy Dowd was beaten.

782
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:47,151
He would've been murdered
if Gregory Moore hadn't filled in for him.

783
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,951
I had nothing do with that.

784
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:50,982
Ask your attorney to explain it to you.

785
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:53,273
You set Dowd up, Moore
was killed in his place.

786
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:55,115
That makes you responsible.

787
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:58,516
Tommy Dowd with his disfigured
face should be a very compelling witness.

788
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,527
He won't testify against me.

789
00:34:00,527 --> 00:34:02,668
Why do you think
he agreed to wear a wire?

790
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,071
He knew you were trying to kill him.

791
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:07,225
I didn't try to kill anyone.
It was just business.

792
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:10,474
Leslie... / These women don't know
if someone loves them or their money.

793
00:34:10,474 --> 00:34:12,154
I provide companionship.

794
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:14,127
You are nothing
but a high-priced pimp.

795
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:16,978
And like a pimp, you use violence
to keep your stable in line.

796
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:19,490
I still haven't heard
the word "Deal."

797
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,545
Man one on Gregory Moore and
she gives me the couple who killed him.

798
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:24,742
She didn't kill him.
Assault two on Dowd.

799
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:25,783
No deal on Dowd.

800
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:27,394
It's man one or nothing.
Take it or leave it.

801
00:34:27,394 --> 00:34:32,303
Listen to me. I have no idea
who those people are.

802
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,110
Why should I believe you?

803
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:36,636
Check my records.

804
00:34:36,636 --> 00:34:38,992
All three times, they called in a different
credit card number.

805
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:40,564
Sometimes a man, sometimes a woman.

806
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:42,999
I didn't know it was the same couple.

807
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,910
Leslie's not lying.

808
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,665
Second and third escort reservations
were also made with
stolen credit card numbers.

809
00:34:51,665 --> 00:34:54,544
We checked the names against
the guest lists in both hotels.

810
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:55,524
No matches.

811
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,323
The perps had to get
the numbers somewhere.

812
00:34:57,323 --> 00:34:58,463
Common denominators?

813
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,881
All of the cards were used
within the last month

814
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:03,129
for purchases from different
mail order companies.

815
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:04,636
That doesn't sound promising.

816
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,296
Except that the companies
operate out of the same warehouse.

817
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:09,262
Scott Distributing,
Dutchess County.

818
00:35:09,262 --> 00:35:12,157
So, whoever's billing the credit card
companies is stealing the numbers.

819
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:13,477
Their accountants handle the billing.

820
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:15,619
A powerhouse firm on 3rd Avenue.

821
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:18,681
Barnett, Sloan & Howard
902 Third Avenue
Tuesday, March 6

822
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,565
I'll help you any way I can, detectives,

823
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,994
but I'm sure nobody here is responsible.

824
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:25,121
Who can we talk to about
the Scott account?

825
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:27,481
Gary Sutton's the senior who runs it,

826
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:29,684
but I think he left early today.

827
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:31,034
In the middle of tax season?

828
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:33,784
Even accountants have a life.
It's his anniversary.

829
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:36,366
I think they were going
to a show and dinner.

830
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,032
Is there any way that
we could reach him?

831
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:42,580
I doubt his cell phone is on
if he's in the theatre.

832
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,361
Is this Mrs. Sutton?

833
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:45,172
Darlene.

834
00:35:45,172 --> 00:35:48,138
Olivia, she look familiar?

835
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:51,868
The couple from the hotel.

836
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:53,819
- From Altoona.
- You got it.

837
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,300
Is something wrong?

838
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,978
We are going to need
Mr. Sutton's home address.

839
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:00,720
Sure. Let me get that for you.

840
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:17,129
Playbills.

841
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:19,883
Like the theatre.

842
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:31,530
Look at this, on the night table.

843
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,352
Didn't even bother to hide them.
Check out the one on top.

844
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:37,206
Joseph Woodward.
Our friend from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

845
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:39,597
An accountant, he has rich clients,
pays their bills.

846
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,323
He can order himself
a credit card in their names.

847
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:42,662
The ones he doesn't
have cards for

848
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:45,390
he uses over the phones.
We got to run these numbers.

849
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,175
- Have Munch and Fin meet us there.
- Find anything?

850
00:36:49,175 --> 00:36:51,009
One of the numbers was used
to book an escort.

851
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,846
7:00, Madison Terrace Hotel.

852
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:54,720
That's 15 minutes from now.

853
00:36:56,057 --> 00:36:58,189
- Excuse me.
- Be with you in a second.

854
00:36:58,189 --> 00:37:00,317
Police. Now.

855
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:02,627
What is it?

856
00:37:02,627 --> 00:37:04,487
She in here tonight?

857
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:09,895
She was with that guy
over there. Just walked out.

858
00:37:12,238 --> 00:37:13,268
He still here?

859
00:37:13,268 --> 00:37:15,349
Fortunately for him.

860
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:18,510
Meeting someone?

861
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:20,224
Who are you?

862
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:22,199
Police.What room is she in?

863
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,318
What are you talking about?

864
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:25,036
Come on.
You are an escort, right?

865
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:27,092
You just gave this woman
the key to your room?

866
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:28,870
She told you to wait five minutes
and follow her.

867
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,071
- You were about to go up?
- And if I was?

868
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:32,749
Then this is the luckiest day
of your life.

869
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:34,912
We need your room number
and your room key.

870
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:41,189
526.

871
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,352
Is someone there?

872
00:38:01,352 --> 00:38:02,504
What do you want with me?

873
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:03,660
Police! Show me your hands!

874
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,625
- Don't shoot!
- Help me, Gary!

875
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:06,710
Hands behind your back now!

876
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,138
Fantasy's over, Darlene.
Get up.

877
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:09,936
Get up. Let's see the hands. 
Up now.

878
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,134
You didn't save me, you bastard!

879
00:38:11,134 --> 00:38:14,046
Here, put the robe on.
Let's go.

880
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:20,322
I get home one night...

881
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:23,686
I hear noises.

882
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:28,436
Go into the bedroom.

883
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,798
Some guy's on top of Darlene.

884
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,526
They're struggling.

885
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:35,775
I thought he was raping her.

886
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,555
What did you do?

887
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,437
Yanked him off.

888
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,426
Roughed him up.

889
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:44,249
Did you call the police?

890
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:49,334
Darlene told me
he was a delivery guy.

891
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:52,158
She invited him in.

892
00:38:55,512 --> 00:38:57,980
She knew I was coming home.

893
00:39:00,794 --> 00:39:03,063
I was her hero.

894
00:39:03,814 --> 00:39:05,891
I saved her.

895
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:10,298
It turned me on.

896
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,418
We let the guy go.

897
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:16,068
Were the escorts your idea or hers?

898
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:18,657
Hers.

899
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:22,790
She picked up some guy from
out of town,

900
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,498
but he didn't want to play the game.

901
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:31,255
Darlene figured we'd get
what we want if we paid for it.

902
00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:33,915
You went along with this?

903
00:39:34,382 --> 00:39:36,270
Don't you understand?

904
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:39,330
I love her.

905
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:44,086
She's got a problem.

906
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,036
She kept picking up these men.

907
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:48,433
You could've stopped
playing her game.

908
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:49,889
No.

909
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:54,017
She needed me to do this.

910
00:39:57,114 --> 00:39:59,637
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

911
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:04,573
I got drawn into it.

912
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,232
It just happened.

913
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:20,325
I don't believe this.

914
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:24,533
Maybe murder two and two counts of
assault one will bring him back to reality.

915
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,967
It's not him I'm worried about.

916
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:30,502
She will get a lawyer who will come up
with some designer psych defense.

917
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:32,463
She's just as guilty as he is.

918
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,065
But he's the killer.

919
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,534
She'll sell him out.

920
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:39,357
So she walks,
and he does 25 to life.

921
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:42,272
I wonder what he's fantasizing
about now.

922
00:40:49,606 --> 00:40:52,611
Gary said...

923
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:55,472
he would kill for me.

924
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:05,414
It was the most powerful
aphrodisiac I've ever felt.

925
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,306
He saved my life.

926
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:15,819
Who did he rescue you from?

927
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:17,789
The men.

928
00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:24,941
In the store, on the subway,
in the street.

929
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:28,227
They would look at me.

930
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:33,348
I knew if they had the chance,
they would ravage me.

931
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,137
I told Gary.

932
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,188
It made him...

933
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:46,566
wild.

934
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,966
An animal.

935
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:54,530
That...

936
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,409
businessman, he wouldn't play,
but...

937
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:01,735
the escorts...

938
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:05,498
they would do anything that I wanted.

939
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,862
All the time...

940
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,988
I'd be thinking about Gary.

941
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:17,859
The brave...

942
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:20,217
strong man...

943
00:42:21,534 --> 00:42:24,741
how he would save me.

944
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:28,653
Take care of him for me.

945
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:36,981
Can I go home now?

946
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:44,913
You're not going home, Darlene.
You're going to jail.

947
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:49,781
I can't go to jail.

948
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:55,225
The inmates, the guards...

949
00:42:55,225 --> 00:42:58,005
what would they do to me?

950
00:43:06,212 --> 00:43:08,608
You will protect me.

951
00:43:09,596 --> 00:43:11,689
Won't you?

952
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:19,601
