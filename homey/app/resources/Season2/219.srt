1
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,099
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,863
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

3
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,064
In New York City,

4
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:33,707
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:36,640
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,511
These are their stories.

7
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:42,434
It's an above-ground Jacuzzi.

8
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:44,428
I don't know why
you're digging that deep.

9
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:45,986
It's called a foundation,
Mr. Sawyer.

10
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:48,647
Just make sure you don't
hit a gas main or something.

11
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:49,902
We know what we're doing.

12
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:52,129
Then you know you have
to take out all those weeds.

13
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:53,991
The roots will break
right through the concrete.

14
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,982
Last owner left
this place a mess.

15
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,462
Don't worry.
We'll clear the whole yard.

16
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,173
No extra charge.

17
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:01,776
Aren't those hydrangea bushes?

18
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:03,528
Why'd you think I said
we'd clear the yard for nothing?

19
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,945
We're gonna make more
off those bushes than off this job.

20
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:07,199
I know a guy in Hackensack...

21
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:09,111
- Oh, jee...
- What?

22
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,339
We closed on the house
a month ago.

23
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,268
Had it inspected, inside and out...

24
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:17,138
For termites, not dead bodies.

25
00:01:17,138 --> 00:01:19,274
We're suing that realtor.
You're all witnesses...

26
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:22,175
Mr. And Mrs. Sawyer, we're gonna
need you to leave the crime scene.

27
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,285
- It's our new home.
- We'll try not to take too long.

28
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,284
It's all right, all right.
Just let them...

29
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,194
Hi.

30
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:30,795
- Detectives.
- What've we got?

31
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:34,347
Judging from the eye orbits,
nasal opening, and cheekbone projection,

32
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:35,876
I'd say a Caucasian.

33
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:38,225
Surface of the auricular region
puts her under 30.

34
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,201
Her?
Did you find any clothes?

35
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:43,251
A few scraps.
Most of the fabric decomposed.

36
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:44,954
But look at the hips.

37
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:48,315
Wide sciatic notch,
long pubic bone.

38
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:50,732
- Definitely female.
- Cause of death?

39
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:52,757
No obvious knife marks
or bullet holes.

40
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:54,870
Hopefully I'll know more
after I put her back together.

41
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,246
Now, how are we getting
sexual homicide from a bunch of bones?

42
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:00,280
Check the evidence tray.

43
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:04,695
It's a crucifix.

44
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:08,085
I think he means
the studded collar and leash.

45
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,706
Looks like our bone lady
was somebody's pet.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/04/27

59
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:04,939
The previous owners
put in the hydrangeas.

60
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:05,862
And they were?

61
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:07,956
The Stantons. Brad and Abbey.

62
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,922
Fought constantly from the day
they moved in,

63
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,558
to the day Abbey moved out.

64
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,348
- And when was that?
- About four years ago.

65
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:15,739
Anything violent?

66
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,471
Loud, yes.
Violent, I never saw.

67
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:20,927
Did Abbey ever come back?

68
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:23,004
Yeah, but not for
a good year or so.

69
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:25,383
She'd pound on his door, wailing.

70
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:27,435
He'd come out, slip her a few bucks.

71
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,682
This became like a weekly ritual.

72
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:31,183
Usually about 3:00 in the morning.

73
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:32,426
How long did that go on?

74
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:33,936
About a month or two.

75
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:36,292
One night he doesn't answer his door.

76
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:39,053
She starts screaming she's gonna
report him to the medical board

77
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,693
for having sex with his patients.

78
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:42,551
- So he's a doctor?
- A surgeon.

79
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,826
Anyhow, the door bursts open,

80
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:47,119
Abbey gets the crap beat out of her.

81
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,539
You said you never saw any violence.

82
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,620
No. I never saw Brad hit her.

83
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,378
This was Pam, the new wife,
throwing the punches.

84
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:56,686
Guess he likes his women feisty.

85
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:59,331
When was the next time
you saw Abbey?

86
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:02,580
Never.

87
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,387
Captain, check it out.

88
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,548
How sick is this?
A crucifix.

89
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,400
Get this, dog collar and leash.

90
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,697
Looks like an S&M session gone south.

91
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:16,827
- The lab get any prints off them?
- Not yet.

92
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,657
Any idea how long she was buried?

93
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:20,665
ME's best guesstimate is three years.

94
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:22,422
What about... / We're all over
missing persons.

95
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:24,480
Okay, so who had access
to this yard?

96
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,855
The previous owners,
the Stantons.

97
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,752
The story reads like
a bad soap opera.

98
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:31,993
Doctor marries wife number two,
wife number one mysteriously disappears.

99
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:35,257
After wife number two uses wife
number one as a punching bag.

100
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:37,321
Well, go have a talk
with the happy couple.

101
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:41,950
You two check and see if anybody else 
remembers the first Mrs. Dr. Stanton.

102
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,080
Million-dollar view
of the murder scene.

103
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,838
Any of your apartments
overlook the yard?

104
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:47,868
We have six buildings on this block.

105
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,332
We're talking 36 units.

106
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:52,973
Any of your tenants come up missing
between late '97, early '99?

107
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:53,810
Yeah.

108
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,410
They go missing when they forget
to pay their rent for three months.

109
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,267
Meanwhile, that's lost income.

110
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,299
We're gonna need a list
from the aforementioned years.

111
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:02,909
And rental applications.

112
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,921
Oh, yeah, applications.

113
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,677
We have a very stringent
screening process

114
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:12,058
what with all the high-class people
desperate to move in here.

115
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:14,096
Can we take a look at your files?

116
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,434
Knock yourselves out.

117
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:22,391
Residence of Dr. & Mrs. Brad Stanton
24 Vanderbilt Place 
Brooklyn, New York
Friday, April 13

118
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:25,486
Brad was married to that
blood-sucking leech for five years.

119
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:27,365
Why did you attack her?

120
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:31,676
Abbey accused Brad
of sleeping with his patients.

121
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:33,657
She's a bottom-feeding,
mainlining junkie.

122
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:36,050
A constant source of embarrassment
for my husband.

123
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,538
And how embarrassed were you?

124
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,230
I was angry.

125
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,720
She was my friend once.
We went to nursing school together.

126
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,790
- When did they divorce?
- In '97.

127
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,551
Brad was extremely generous.

128
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,503
You mean above and beyond
the settlement?

129
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:49,232
Until I put my foot down.

130
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:51,718
It was about three years ago,
he finally cut her off.

131
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,656
Have you heard from her since?

132
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,510
No, thank God.

133
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:58,919
Why? What kind of trouble
is Abbey in now?

134
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,513
A woman's remains were found buried

135
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:03,750
under the hydrangea
behind your former brownstone.

136
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:06,385
Oh, my God.

137
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:09,783
They've been there
about three years.

138
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,282
Where's your husband now?

139
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:17,924
The hospital. Extremely busy.

140
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,212
Look,

141
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,641
Brad couldn't kill anybody,
not even that horrible bitch.

142
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,536
I have to go to work.

143
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:31,167
I didn't kill Abbey.

144
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,316
She was busy killing herself
with her habit.

145
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:35,314
But you married her anyway?

146
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:37,157
I loved her.

147
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:39,776
Back then, she was only
on Xanax for anxiety

148
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,628
and then she started
stealing Demerol and Dilaudid...

149
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,205
and the hospital
finally had to fire her.

150
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,678
That must have been
humiliating for you

151
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:47,615
especially the yelling
and the extortion.

152
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,595
I had to sit there and watch, powerless,
while she hit rock bottom.

153
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:53,521
Bottom being three feet
under your former hydrangeas.

154
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,123
It's not Abbey.

155
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:58,613
Look, I got a case in half an hour.
I got to scrub.

156
00:06:58,613 --> 00:06:59,976
Without saying hello to your wife?

157
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,141
Leave her out of this.

158
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:02,783
I told you he was busy.

159
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:05,956
I can handle this.
I'll see you inside. / Okay.

160
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:07,901
Stop wasting our time.

161
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:14,369
That's what you're looking for.

162
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,941
Please, whatever you do,

163
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,528
don't tell Pam.

164
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,488
Mercy Aids Hospice
426 Flatbush Avenue
Friday, April 13

165
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,629
She's not gonna
be able to tell you much.

166
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:30,834
This is Abbey?

167
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,696
AIDS-related dementia.

168
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:35,781
Dr. Stanton pays the bills,
keeps the roses fresh.

169
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:37,179
When was the last time
he was here?

170
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:38,668
When he brought her in.

171
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,763
She hasn't had a visitor since.

172
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:43,751
It's sad. She doesn't have
much time left.

173
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:44,883
Thank you.

174
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,234
Now what?

175
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:49,399
Back to the bones.

176
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:52,452
Figure out how she died yet?

177
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,054
Strangulation.

178
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,250
Pressure fractures to the hyoid.

179
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,636
Fits the S&M theory.

180
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:59,986
Auto-erotic asphyxiation,
but he mistimes it.

181
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,826
Don't know how he could have.

182
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:04,618
There's a peri-mortem break
in one of the metacarpals of her right hand.

183
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,204
So she put up a struggle.
Now we're back to the sexual sadist.

184
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,226
What else have we got?

185
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,493
Well, she was petite.

186
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:12,024
I measured her femur.
Estimate she was 5'4.

187
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,295
And I think she was
Eastern European.

188
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,254
- You got that from the bones?
- From her teeth.

189
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:19,580
I found traces of arsenic.

190
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,188
Using arsenic to kill a nerve
is an old Russian dental practice

191
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:23,782
that spread to
most of the Eastern Bloc.

192
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:27,231
Great. So her dental records are
somewhere in the former Soviet Union.

193
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,781
Maybe this will help.

194
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:30,700
Henry is our forensic anthropologist.

195
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,290
Show them what you came up with.

196
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,371
I entered the dimensions of the skull,
put in tissue depth markers.

197
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,140
That's determined by age, right?

198
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,473
We figure she's around 30...

199
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:41,646
so she'd have more facial tissue than,
say, a 50-year-old.

200
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,543
Then what?

201
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:44,880
I fashioned the nose, ears,
and mouth accordingly,

202
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,669
and layer by layer got this.

203
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:50,937
How close do you think it is?

204
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:53,659
It's a reasonable approximation.

205
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,062
Print her out.

206
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:59,228
So she's from behind
the fallen Iron Curtain.

207
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:02,819
That narrows it down to a couple hundred 
thousand of your poor huddled masses.

208
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:03,621
What's all that?

209
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:07,388
Meticulously kept records from the tenement 
complex behind our burial ground.

210
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:10,584
The manager's been somewhat remiss
in keeping track of her tenants.

211
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,085
I guess we can rule out
Ming Noh Ling.

212
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,235
Any names in there
that sound Eastern Bloc?

213
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:17,071
Sixteen and counting.

214
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:18,589
Track them down.

215
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,839
No, I don't speak Romanian.
You speak English?

216
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,692
Yes, I understand. Latvia.

217
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,737
Is there anyone else there
who knows what happened to her?

218
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:29,495
You're saying that she went back
to Latvia two years ago, right?

219
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:32,390
I'm calling from the police department,
not lmmigration.

220
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,429
Sir, we have nothing
to do with deportation.

221
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:35,840
Okay, yes, thank you.

222
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,125
Hello?

223
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,633
- Hello...
- Find anything?

224
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,688
Yeah. Eastern Europeans
don't trust cops.

225
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,207
I have two that are unaccounted for.

226
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,331
I have three.
How are you guys doing?

227
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,004
Yearning to be free of this.

228
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,428
- Five people I can't place.
- One.

229
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:52,343
Okay. Let's just get them over
to missing persons, okay?

230
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:54,831
No match.

231
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:57,071
- How many more of these?
- Three boxes.

232
00:09:57,071 --> 00:10:00,121
You know how many women
go missing in this city every year?

233
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,148
Hey.

234
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:02,322
You find something?

235
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:03,867
I don't know. You tell me.

236
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,335
Pretty damn close.

237
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:10,942
"Ava Parulis." That's P-A-R.

238
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,748
Reported missing:
April of '98.

239
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:15,957
Here we go.

240
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:21,263
Ava Parulis rented an apartment behind
the crime scene in February '98.

241
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:22,997
Gone by that April.

242
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,704
Skipped out on
the last month's rent.

243
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:25,984
How far did you guys get with her?

244
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:27,607
From what it says here,
not too far.

245
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,847
The detective who worked
the case retired to Arizona last year.

246
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,465
And who reported her missing?

247
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,720
Let me see.

248
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,977
Guy in Queens, George Burton.

249
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:38,028
The address is in Rego Park.

250
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,771
Hi. What's your name?

251
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:45,047
I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

252
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,334
You're right.
What if I tell you we're police officers?

253
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,155
Do you have badges?

254
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:51,123
Right answer again.
My name is Elliot.

255
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:53,191
This is my friend, Olivia.

256
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,062
Can I help you?

257
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:57,341
They're policemen, Daddy.

258
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:01,110
Go inside, Julia, it's getting cold.

259
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,341
Bye. Sorry to bother you.

260
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:07,455
I'm Det. Stabler, this is
my partner, Det. Benson.

261
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:08,850
Something's wrong?

262
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,050
You reported your sister-in-law...
Ava Parulis, missing.

263
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:15,806
You found Ava?

264
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:17,249
We may have.

265
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,493
I gave this picture to the police.

266
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:23,615
What happened to Ava?

267
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,129
The police are here?

268
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:27,603
Is everything all right?

269
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:41,515
My twin sister, Ava, and I came here
five years ago from Romania.

270
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,375
She was always
bossing me around.

271
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,422
She was older by six minutes.

272
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:53,952
Do you have any idea
who could have killed your sister?

273
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,792
No.

274
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,823
I have twins.
They're inseparable.

275
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:03,667
You two must have been close.

276
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:04,977
Ava was wild.

277
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:07,056
The two of them couldn't
have been more different.

278
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:09,626
Ava played by her own rules.

279
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:13,348
She went from one rich man to the next.

280
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,035
Until she finally met the wrong one.

281
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,693
Irina.

282
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:20,494
I'm sorry.

283
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:24,988
Please forgive my wife.

284
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:28,996
Mr. Burton, we know how difficult
this must be for you.

285
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:32,376
Irina and Ava lived through hell.

286
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,096
Orphanages, abuse.

287
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:38,918
When they came to this country,
all they had was each other.

288
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:41,459
- What happened?
- They had a falling-out.

289
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,651
Over what?

290
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:45,981
Ava said she could never settle
for a life like this and...

291
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:49,602
Irina told her
to stop dreaming and grow up.

292
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,035
I never saw Ava again.

293
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:54,149
And this was about
three years ago?

294
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,580
Little longer.

295
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,852
It was Julia's first birthday party.
Ava was supposed to be there.

296
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:00,875
She just didn't show.

297
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,932
This was the last straw for Irina.

298
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:05,341
Now, what made you think
that Ava was missing?

299
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:06,825
I went looking for her.

300
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:09,520
Try to patch things up
between the two of them.

301
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,707
But the apartment was empty
and Ava was gone.

302
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:17,797
Irina said she must have run off
with one of her men.

303
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:22,638
I had a bad feeling,
that's why I called the police.

304
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:25,394
Do you know the names
of any of these boyfriends?

305
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:29,400
Only one. Matt...

306
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,817
Matt Sloane, I think.

307
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,343
Sloane Importers
997 Fifth Avenue
Monday, April 16

308
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:39,033
Ava was sexy and adventurous.

309
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,624
You mean, kinky?

310
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:42,294
Let's just say she was wild.

311
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:43,941
Did you ever tame her?

312
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:46,926
You know, S&M, bondage, discipline?

313
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,842
I'm not into that.

314
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,359
How long were you two together?

315
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,977
About four months.

316
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,519
These your girlfriends?

317
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,979
I love beautiful women.

318
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,351
Did you love Ava?

319
00:13:58,351 --> 00:13:59,758
It was a business arrangement.

320
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:02,044
She was smart,
charming, multi-lingual.

321
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:05,231
She helped me develop business contacts
in Eastern Europe.

322
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,730
And the sex was great.

323
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,903
Yeah, what'd she get out of it?

324
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:10,031
Her passion was expensive jewelry.

325
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,097
She'd throw a tantrum
if I got her anything else.

326
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:15,088
Like the thousand-dollar bottle of perfume
she threw in my face.

327
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,629
That must've made you angry.

328
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:19,697
Angry enough to end it.
I terminated our agreement.

329
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:20,968
Did you see her after that?

330
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:23,739
Unfortunately, yes,
at a reception at the UN.

331
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,277
Who was she with?

332
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:26,343
I don't know who brought her there

333
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:29,577
but she left with the Romanian
Deputy Chief of Mission.

334
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,515
A diplomat?

335
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:33,861
And an importer,
and who knows how many others.

336
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:34,988
She was definitely a player.

337
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:36,461
She'd get her hooks into these guys

338
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,115
for as long as
she could get what she wanted.

339
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:41,093
When the well ran dry,
she'd move on and drink from the next one.

340
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:42,376
What about the sister?

341
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:43,539
They were on the outs.

342
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,767
Ava walked on the wild side

343
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,240
while Irina settled down
with the husband, the kid.

344
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,584
We checked Sloane's record.

345
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,808
Got picked up during
a undercover vice sting.

346
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,802
One count of soliciting prostitution.

347
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:54,535
And he was very specific about
what he wanted,

348
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:56,243
a doggie collar, the whole works.

349
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:58,639
Unfortunately, his passport
showed he was out of the country

350
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,504
when Ava was reported missing.

351
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:02,522
Find out how Ava got into the country

352
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:06,420
and check whether her former landlady
has anything more to tell us.

353
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,163
What do you want us to do about our friend
from the Romanian Mission?

354
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:12,889
Well, he has immunity from arrest,
but not from talking to us.

355
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:15,189
Play nice, maybe he will.

356
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:19,354
Permanent Mission of Romania
to The United Nations
Tuesday, April 17

357
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:22,673
Ava had that odd combination
of greed and innocence.

358
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,352
Very common in girls
from the countryside.

359
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:27,821
You were romantically involved?

360
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:28,796
No.

361
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:30,971
I attend many official functions.

362
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,938
I needed at my side a woman
who spoke my language, knew our customs.

363
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,436
And Ava was okay with that?

364
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,803
Very much so.

365
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,181
She got to meet many important men.

366
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:41,826
Any of them want her dead?

367
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:43,970
I can't imagine so.

368
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:46,980
Look at this orchid.

369
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,019
This orchid took years of cultivation.

370
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,884
A hybrid I developed.

371
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,050
It's beautiful.

372
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,624
Do you know the orchid
is also a parasite?

373
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,910
It devours the host plant
while it blooms magnificently.

374
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,217
Is that how you thought of Ava,
as a parasite?

375
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:08,664
No, our relationship
was more symbiotic.

376
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,936
We benefited mutually.

377
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:14,457
Can you tell us how Ava got into
this country?

378
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:19,663
Our emigration agency deals with 
thousands upon thousands of applications

379
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:23,556
and there is no way I can tell you
about circumstances of each one.

380
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:26,772
Besides Ava and I
had never discussed it.

381
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,679
I remember her.

382
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,251
She walked around like she was
the Czarina of 13th street.

383
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:36,594
This was hers.

384
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:39,017
Mr. Sanchez?

385
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,313
Ava have any regular visitors?

386
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:46,480
Only one I remember.
Older guy.

387
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,374
Always dressed to kill.

388
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,507
Rich uncle?

389
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:50,756
Sugar daddy.

390
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:53,031
I see he kept her in the lap of luxury.

391
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:56,177
Mercedes owners,
they think they run the world.

392
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:58,967
He parked his by
the fire hydrant every time.

393
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,076
What'd he look like?

394
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:01,622
Somebody important.

395
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:03,313
Specifics don't concern me.

396
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,207
- How about a name?
- Too specific.

397
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:08,737
What'd you do with her stuff?

398
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,909
The place comes
completely furnished.

399
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,904
She showed up with one suitcase.

400
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:14,624
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

401
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:17,147
She was two months
behind in the rent.

402
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:19,441
Seeing as how she was murdered,

403
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:21,544
shouldn't the city
reimburse me for that?

404
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,509
Call your councilman.

405
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,752
Ava had a room with a view.

406
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,904
Yeah, of her own grave.

407
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,692
Guy at the Mission
was another one of Ava's boys.

408
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:37,690
Claims he had no idea
how or why Ava came into this country.

409
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,918
Our immigration was a little more helpful.

410
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:41,521
Ava came here in '96 on a fiancee visa.

411
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,571
Name of the fiancee: Paul Amis.

412
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,661
Address in Minneola
on Long Island.

413
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:48,829
Arrangements made through
an agency by the name of Euromatch.

414
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:49,980
Mail-order brides.

415
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,064
Maybe I should've tried that instead of the
traditional courtship and wedding ritual

416
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:55,237
then I'd be paying
less of my paycheck to alimony.

417
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:57,372
We'll take the groom,
you take the matchmaker.

418
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,578
- Maybe you'll get lucky.
- Okay.

419
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:03,632
I shelled out $50,000
to bring Ava here.

420
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,487
You know what the average wage
is in her country?

421
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:06,917
$50 a month.

422
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:10,606
And all she had to do was cook and clean
and be available for sex.

423
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,530
It's called being a wife.

424
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,312
When'd you last see Ava?

425
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,166
The day I returned her,
after the 90-day trial period.

426
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,526
Didn't work out, huh?

427
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:21,097
Must have made you angry.

428
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:22,442
I got my money back.

429
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:25,115
- Did you get a divorce?
- Annulment.

430
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:28,585
This is my wife, May Ling.

431
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,409
Sweetheart, this is Det. Benson
and Det. Stabler.

432
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:33,671
May I bring you something to drink?

433
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:36,204
No, doll. They're not staying.

434
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:38,556
Leave us alone for another minute.

435
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,112
You didn't tell us
why you returned Ava.

436
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:49,450
Because I didn't pay all that money
for her to run around with some dentist.

437
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,081
She was exotic.

438
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,095
Pretty, smart, the whole package.

439
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:55,119
I was ready to take
the big step with Ava.

440
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,111
And the fact that she was already
married had no bearing on that?

441
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:00,198
Her husband was
beating her up every night.

442
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:02,786
He once hit her so hard,
I had to put in five caps.

443
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:04,793
The marriage was over.

444
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,339
Where'd you two meet?

445
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,007
Party. She was there
with her husband.

446
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,596
Someone told her I was known as
the "Dentist to the Stars"...

447
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,267
and she was all over me.

448
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:16,274
- Who called off the wedding plans?
- I did.

449
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:18,505
- Why?
- Because she lied.

450
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,240
She said she was a student,

451
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,529
she had cousins who brought her over.

452
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,476
And you found out otherwise?

453
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:27,642
I hired a private detective
to do a background check.

454
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:29,342
Sounds like true love.

455
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,858
I have a very lucrative practice.

456
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:33,779
I have to take precautions.

457
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,566
I found out she was a mail-order bride

458
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:38,694
like those Russian Natashas,
gold diggers.

459
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,320
Okay. We're gonna need
Ava's dental records.

460
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,127
I'll get them together for you.

461
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,884
Euromathch, Inc.
110 Sixth Avenue
Tuesday, April 17

462
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:51,169
We match girls with traditional values...

463
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,749
with men who want wives
instead of partners.

464
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:55,695
You mean, "Stay at home,
make my dinner, do the laundry...

465
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,092
"be available when I need you for sex,"
type of woman?

466
00:19:58,092 --> 00:19:59,509
You make it sound so tawdry.

467
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:02,917
The divorce rate among our couples is
half that of the population.

468
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,744
If a guy wants to get married,
he needs a fiance visa...

469
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:08,889
he has to prove he knew his wife-to-be
before she comes over.

470
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:09,902
Correct.

471
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:13,735
We send our clients
to Estonia, Romania, Latvia, or Russia...

472
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:16,845
for two weeks where he meets
maybe eight girls a day.

473
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:20,089
Once he makes his choice,
we photograph them together for the INS...

474
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,922
and take care of the paperwork.

475
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,777
And if by some fluke
it doesn't work out?

476
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:26,805
Satisfaction guaranteed for
90 days, or your money back.

477
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:27,903
Interested?

478
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:28,851
Too easy.

479
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:31,767
Without abject suffering,
I wouldn't know what to do with myself.

480
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:35,688
Green card status on
a fiance visa is conditional for two years.

481
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:38,196
If the marriage doesn't last that long,
then what happens?

482
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,029
The girl is usually deported.

483
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:42,406
Unless she left because her husband
abused her.

484
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:44,904
Then the INS
will grant an exception.

485
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:47,242
- How often does that happen?
- Almost never.

486
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:49,454
We do thorough
background checks on the men.

487
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:51,268
You're lucky Ava didn't sue you.

488
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:53,648
Her hand-picked hubby
was a wife-beater.

489
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:55,942
If we had known that,
we would have intervened.

490
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:58,582
Sent her to stay with
her sister, Irina.

491
00:20:58,582 --> 00:20:59,852
You know about Irina?

492
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:01,750
She and Ava came over together.

493
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,526
Fortunately Irina's marriage
is a match made in heaven.

494
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,601
Why didn't you tell us
that Ava was married?

495
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,076
I was afraid.

496
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:11,045
Of what?

497
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:12,345
Her husband,

498
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:14,318
he hit me once
when I went to see her.

499
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:15,249
Why?

500
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:17,240
Because I told her
she should leave him,

501
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,518
and she wouldn't.

502
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,228
He beat her up.

503
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:22,674
Degraded my sister.

504
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:24,410
Could he have killed her?

505
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:27,010
I know he came close.

506
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:33,817
Civil sexual harassment suit
filed by a former employee.

507
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:40,429
Wow. Restraining orders,
filed by your first and second wives.

508
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,289
Hey, I didn't kill Ava.

509
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:45,023
You forced her to have sex with you.

510
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:46,662
That's called rape.

511
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:50,021
You pulled out fistfuls of her hair,
knocked her teeth out.

512
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:52,039
That's assault.

513
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:53,592
Prove it.

514
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,841
You think that we'd call you
all the way down here if we couldn't?

515
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:58,039
Maybe she was blackmailing him.

516
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,749
Threatening to call the cops.
Is that why you shut her up?

517
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:02,221
Is that it?

518
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:11,747
This is like a game of Clue.
(Clue:º¸µå °ÔÀÓÀÇ ÀÏÁ¾)

519
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,287
Ava went through a diplomat,
an importer, a dentist,

520
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:15,445
and now this loser.

521
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:17,779
- This loser give you anything?
- Not yet. Why?

522
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,362
Taylor called.
Wants you down at the lab.

523
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:23,174
I'll keep this guy on ice
until you get back.

524
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:29,022
No way these belong to Ava Parulis.

525
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:30,642
You got us down here for that?

526
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,088
The dentist must have made
a mistake. We'll go back.

527
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:34,450
Don't bother.

528
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:37,140
The dental work doesn't match,
but everything else does.

529
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,079
Shape of the teeth,
jaw is identical.

530
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:43,044
Son of a bitch.

531
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,020
Irina is Ava.

532
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,431
I need proof she killed Irina.

533
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:54,140
We've got Irina's dental records.

534
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,354
They match the skull.

535
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:57,332
That doesn't mean
Ava murdered her sister.

536
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,511
Well, she did assume her identity.

537
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,008
Ava's apartment
overlooked Irina's grave.

538
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:04,123
Circumstantial.
Give me a motive.

539
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:05,878
Ava's marriage is annulled.

540
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:08,672
She doesn't want a one-way trip back
to hard times in Romania.

541
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:10,991
I need physical evidence linking them.

542
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:14,517
Come on, Counselor,
we've done a lot more with a lot less.

543
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:16,803
All right.

544
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:18,417
Search the house.

545
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:21,607
The cars are gone.

546
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:23,025
Go around back.

547
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:29,450
Police!

548
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:35,613
Mrs. Burton?

549
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:43,694
- Go fill in our friends.
- Right.

550
00:23:57,388 --> 00:23:59,717
- All clear.
- Nobody downstairs.

551
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:01,686
Nothing messed up
in the kid's room.

552
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:04,477
Ava left in a hurry.
She must've decided not to pack.

553
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,467
Looks like a train ran through here.

554
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:11,097
It looks like she took all the available
money they had on hand here.

555
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:13,251
Get the note.

556
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:16,182
"I'm sorry. I do love you, George.

557
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:19,738
I never meant to
hurt you or Julia or Irina."

558
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:22,798
- We should talk to the husband.
- You mean the brother-in-law.

559
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:24,547
If she cleaned out
their emergency money...

560
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,393
she may have wiped out
their bank accounts.

561
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:28,588
We'll finish up here
and check it out.

562
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:31,834
My wife can't be dead.

563
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,597
What are you talking about?
You're crazy.

564
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,412
The dental records prove it.

565
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,288
You're saying Irina is
buried in that grave?

566
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:38,781
We're sorry.

567
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:42,032
My wife is a loving woman.
She's a good mother.

568
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:44,649
All Ava ever cared about
was herself and her money.

569
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,257
We've been to the house.
Ava's gone.

570
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:48,328
She packed up and left.

571
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,293
I don't believe that.

572
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:51,974
She left this note.

573
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,272
I don't care. It's not true.

574
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,037
Mr. Burton.

575
00:25:00,952 --> 00:25:03,025
Irina's crucifix.

576
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,593
Where'd you get that?

577
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:09,549
From the grave.

578
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,836
When we were first married,

579
00:25:24,836 --> 00:25:26,786
she used to go to Mass
every morning...

580
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:30,464
and then she just stopped
three years ago.

581
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:33,383
Said she'd lost her faith.

582
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,397
You said you never saw Ava
after she and Irina had a falling-out.

583
00:25:37,397 --> 00:25:39,500
Do you know if Irina saw her?

584
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:45,861
Ava called,
said she needed money.

585
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:48,761
We'd just had the baby
and business was slow

586
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:51,328
so Irina went over there...

587
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:54,306
to explain why
we couldn't help and...

588
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:57,566
she didn't come back
until 2:00 in the morning.

589
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,842
She killed her.

590
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,654
Did she say anything?

591
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:13,623
She wouldn't talk.

592
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,662
Said she was sick.

593
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:19,658
Spent the next two weeks in bed.

594
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:24,389
Why would she do this?

595
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,736
That's what we're trying to find out.

596
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:29,238
Where's your daughter?

597
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,797
Oh, my God!

598
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,368
"Up, up, up. Faster and faster
the little engine climbed..."

599
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:36,724
Daddy!

600
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,208
Is there a problem, Mr. Burton?

601
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,118
No, everything's fine.

602
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:43,702
You just missed your wife.

603
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,769
- When was that?
- About 20 minutes.

604
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:49,344
She seemed upset.
Talked to Julia and then left.

605
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:51,451
Hi, Julia. You remember us?

606
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,995
Do you know why your mommy
came to see you today?

607
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:56,636
To give me this.

608
00:26:57,192 --> 00:26:58,984
It has her picture inside it.

609
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,630
Wow, that's pretty.

610
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,784
Did she say where she was going?

611
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:06,885
No. But she told me that we couldn't
go see the puppet man today.

612
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:09,671
- Who's the puppet man?
- Walt. He's nice.

613
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,445
Why do you call him
the puppet man?

614
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:13,683
Because when Mommy goes
to see her friend,

615
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:16,158
Walt shows me the puppet.

616
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:19,195
I have no idea
who she's talking about.

617
00:27:19,195 --> 00:27:20,918
Okay, Julia,

618
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:24,378
do you remember the name
of your mommy's friend?

619
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:27,818
Valentina.
She's nice, too.

620
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:30,430
We pulled the Burtons'
bank statements.

621
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,476
- Yeah? What'd you find?
- A lot of zeros.

622
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:34,376
Ava cleaned out their accounts
this morning.

623
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:36,979
On top of the $300 she withdraws
on the last Friday of every month.

624
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:38,178
Her husband know about this?

625
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:39,955
All the cancelled checks
have her signature.

626
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:41,468
She must be paying
the household bills.

627
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:43,149
Any idea where
the money's going?

628
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:44,139
We pulled their LUDs.

629
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:47,078
Also on the last Friday of every month
one phone call to Euromatch,

630
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:49,922
Valentina Bilescu's
mail-order bride agency.

631
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:51,643
Olivia just called.

632
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:54,096
The Burtons' kid said
she and her mother were regulars.

633
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:57,974
Mom met with Valentina while
some guy entertained the girl with a puppet.

634
00:27:57,974 --> 00:27:59,920
Why is Ava going to a matchmaker?

635
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,727
I don't know. I think it's time we paid
Miss Bilescu a visit.

636
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,533
- Can I help you, gentlemen?
- Where's Valentina?

637
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:07,349
Not here.

638
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:08,911
Not an answer.
Where is she?

639
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:10,406
I haven't done anything illegal.

640
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:11,891
Really? Where's your puppet?

641
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,003
What are you guys talking about?

642
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:16,711
The one you entertain Julia Burton with
while her mother's paying off your boss.

643
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:18,383
I take the money, give it to Valentina.

644
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:19,515
I don't know what it's for.

645
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:21,147
Hear that?
Says he doesn't know what it's for.

646
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:23,587
He doesn't know that his boss
smuggles women into the country?

647
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:25,406
I wouldn't know anything about that.

648
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:28,164
You take the money,
that makes you an accessory.

649
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,520
One more time, where is she?

650
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:33,273
At her other office.

651
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:35,755
Some warehouse down in Chelsea.

652
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:39,519
Not a sweatshop.

653
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,031
The kind you had in mind.

654
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:44,405
Police! Police!

655
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:47,147
Police! Police!

656
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:49,722
- Where's Valentina?
- I don't know about anything.

657
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:52,046
English.
Do you speak English?

658
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:53,876
These women aren't being held
against their will, are they?

659
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:54,643
Because if they are,

660
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:57,495
you're going for kidnapping,
as well as pimping.

661
00:28:57,495 --> 00:28:59,770
Valentina is in there.

662
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:02,101
- What is this?
- It's called a raid.

663
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:03,908
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Let go of me.

664
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,867
Where's your warrant?

665
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,233
Signed on a judge's desk.

666
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:09,640
Valentina Bilescu, you're under arrest for
unlawful imprisonment

667
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,688
kidnapping,
and promoting prostitution.

668
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:12,578
Where's Ava?

669
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:14,448
I don't have to tell you anything.

670
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:19,122
What's the cash for?

671
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:21,020
No. Please, no.

672
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,826
Ava Parulis, you're under arrest for
the murder of Irina Burton.

673
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,459
I didn't kill her!

674
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,751
It's not... It's not Irina!

675
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:29,001
Who is this?

676
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,868
She's my little sister.

677
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:33,798
I was buying her freedom.

678
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:35,885
Take her.

679
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:45,145
- I didn't kill Irina.
- So why'd you run?

680
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:48,090
Didn't murder her, you just happened
to take her identity and her family.

681
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,021
When the bones were
identified, you got scared.

682
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:53,157
You helped yourself
to George and Irina's bank account.

683
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:54,742
Figure that'll keep you
going for a while?

684
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:56,077
No. None of it's true.

685
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:59,280
Then how did Irina end up
underneath the hydrangea

686
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,348
in the back of your apartment?

687
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:03,239
I buried her there!

688
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:07,654
Right. You buried her
but you didn't murder her?

689
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:10,188
When I came home that night
to my apartment,

690
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:13,492
Irina was dead.
She was lying on the floor.

691
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:15,456
The neighbor had
his garden dug up.

692
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:18,544
I put Irina in a garbage bag
and dragged her downstairs.

693
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:20,715
I covered her with dirt.

694
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,104
I buried her.

695
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,805
What about the collar
and the leash?

696
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,478
They were mine.

697
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:27,427
I buried my past with Irina.

698
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:29,978
Well, why didn't you
just call the police?

699
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:34,837
Whoever killed Irina
was really after me.

700
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:38,750
Valentina had our sister.
I had to get her out.

701
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,150
Did Valentina threaten you?

702
00:30:43,994 --> 00:30:47,654
If you cooperate,
we can help you.

703
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:52,607
In my country,
the police help no one.

704
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,280
Ava kills one sister while paying to
rescue the other?

705
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,433
It doesn't make any sense.

706
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:03,849
There's no way someone her size

707
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:06,658
dragged a body down three flights
of stairs and then buried it.

708
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,869
If she didn't kill her sister,
what is she hiding?

709
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,427
Maybe she's protecting whoever did.

710
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:13,496
Valentina Bilescu?

711
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:15,915
Let's ask the other sister.

712
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:19,357
You didn't know it was Ava?

713
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:22,503
I haven't seen my sisters for years.

714
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:25,984
Since Valentina bring me
to this hellhole.

715
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:27,878
What happened to Irina?

716
00:31:27,878 --> 00:31:31,062
Ava's been impersonating Irina
since she murdered her three years ago.

717
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:34,435
Ava would never harm Irina
or anyone else.

718
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,214
I want to see her.

719
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:39,107
You can't.
She's going to jail.

720
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,228
- Valentina did this.
- Why?

721
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,575
She promised me marriage.
A new life.

722
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:52,756
I went to her parties in Bucharest
to meet American men

723
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:55,660
and one of them,
he proposed to me.

724
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,646
So Valentina,
she bring me back here.

725
00:31:58,646 --> 00:32:01,175
- Did you get married?
- Yes.

726
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:04,525
But the pig changed his mind.

727
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:06,593
I thought I would get deported.

728
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,528
Who let you stay here?

729
00:32:08,528 --> 00:32:10,577
Valentina.

730
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:14,342
She said she would protect me.

731
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:16,495
And she take me to that place.

732
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:18,821
She turned me into a whore.

733
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:21,132
Why didn't you say no?

734
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:23,915
No one says no to Valentina.

735
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:25,700
How long did she keep you there?

736
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,444
Three-and-a-half years.

737
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,408
Until the debt was paid off.

738
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:30,813
What debt?

739
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:33,100
My ex-husband.

740
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:35,622
Valentina give him back his money.

741
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:39,279
She say it was my fault
he wasn't satisfied.

742
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,200
That I have to pay her back
for all the money she lost.

743
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,486
Why didn't you run away?

744
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:52,240
Because Valentina say
she will kill my sisters...

745
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,113
if I went back to Romania.

746
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:58,593
When can I go?

747
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:00,666
The only place you're going
is Rikers Island.

748
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:02,301
I'll make bail.

749
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,153
Don't count on it.

750
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:06,529
Judges don't usually send
accused killers home.

751
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:07,953
Who did I kill?

752
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,950
You're being charged as an accessory to
the murder of Irina Burton.

753
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,150
I am not a killer.

754
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,552
I bring American men
the brides they want.

755
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:16,347
You mean, the women you kidnap.

756
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:18,742
I brought these girls here
to marry, have a better life.

757
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:21,682
I sheltered them after
their husbands rejected them.

758
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:23,507
You forced them into prostitution.

759
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:25,344
You can't prove anything.

760
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:27,094
When Ava Parulis threatened
to blow the whistle,

761
00:33:27,094 --> 00:33:31,159
you decided to kill her.
Except you got her sister by mistake.

762
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,648
Who helped you?

763
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,955
Get me my lawyer.
Now.

764
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,170
Valentina gave me nothing.

765
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,418
And Ava's acting more like
a victim than a perp.

766
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:45,785
She hooked up with Valentina,
got in over her head.

767
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:47,237
They're both afraid of someone.

768
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:48,814
If Valentina's not gonna tell us

769
00:33:48,814 --> 00:33:51,090
who maybe there's something
in her office that will.

770
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,689
Oksana's statements
about the death threats...

771
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:55,155
should be more than enough
probable cause for a search warrant.

772
00:33:55,155 --> 00:33:56,040
I'll call it in.

773
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,042
I'll have John and Fin execute it.
Bring George Burton in.

774
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:02,037
He may be able to help us
get something out of Ava.

775
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:06,216
- What do you guys want now?
- This is a search warrant.

776
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:08,258
Where does Valentina
keep her financial records?

777
00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:09,266
At the accountant's.

778
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:11,556
Not those records.
The real books for her whorehouse.

779
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:12,976
I don't know what you're talking about.

780
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:14,955
You don't know much
for a valued employee, do you?

781
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:17,176
Maybe he knows
what accessory to a murder is.

782
00:34:17,176 --> 00:34:19,303
Murder? I'm just a clerk.

783
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,532
- Who is Valentina's partner?
- I don't know.

784
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:25,335
Did any of Valentina's friends
hang around here more than others?

785
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:28,876
Some old guy, same accent,
always in a suit.

786
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:30,419
Comes in a couple times a week.

787
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:33,063
He and Valentina always lock themselves
in her office.

788
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:36,033
Maybe that's where they keep
the real books.

789
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,184
Follow me.

790
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:40,975
What have we got?

791
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:43,218
Valentina's silent partner.

792
00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:44,915
A Razvan Toscu.

793
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:47,718
Romanian Deputy Chief
of Mission and orchid lover.

794
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,525
Which means he could run you down,
leave skid marks...

795
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:51,458
and we still couldn't issue
a speeding ticket.

796
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,927
With his diplomatic juice
he may have been able to get visas...

797
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,416
keep product in the pipeline, girls...

798
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,978
We'll deal with him later.
What about George Burton?

799
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:01,030
Says he's willing to play.

800
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,714
- There's another sister?
- We have her upstairs.

801
00:35:06,714 --> 00:35:08,465
Where did you find her?

802
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:12,061
She was being held against her will
and forced into prostitution.

803
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:14,047
We found Ava there
trying to buy her freedom.

804
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,196
With the money
that she stole from you.

805
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,130
Why didn't she tell me?

806
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,775
Maybe she thought you'd be
in danger if you knew.

807
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:26,180
You sure you're ready for this?

808
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,555
No.

809
00:35:33,024 --> 00:35:36,006
When are you going
to let me out of here?

810
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,504
No, it's me, Ava.

811
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:47,081
I didn't expect you to come.

812
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:49,952
You shared my bed
for three years.

813
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,426
You raised my daughter.

814
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:58,278
And it was a lie?

815
00:35:58,278 --> 00:36:00,310
Irina was dead.

816
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:03,333
She would have wanted this.

817
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:09,217
They know about the Toscu guy.

818
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,350
If he finds out,
he's gonna kill you,

819
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,677
like he killed Irina.

820
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:14,945
Why did he kill Irina?

821
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:17,256
Because I threatened to tell
the police about him

822
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:19,873
if he didn't let Oksana go.

823
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:21,889
How do you know he killed Irina?

824
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,926
I saw him,

825
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:26,548
outside my apartment building.

826
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:29,721
He left something next to the trash
in a plastic bag.

827
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:33,695
I looked inside and it was Irina.

828
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,222
I put on her wedding rings,

829
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:41,033
and buried her under
the neighbor's garden.

830
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:45,620
He raped her.

831
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,397
He made her wear the collar.

832
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:52,568
He did to her
what he used to do to me.

833
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:54,315
How could you let that happen?

834
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:56,514
I wasn't there!

835
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,584
I couldn't stop him.

836
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:05,564
Irina never told him it wasn't me.

837
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,616
Why didn't you tell me?

838
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:16,653
As long as they thought
I was dead, we were safe.

839
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:20,279
All the men...

840
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:26,901
the jewelry,
the money I took from you...

841
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:32,821
all I wanted it for
was to get Oksana out.

842
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:37,793
I'm so sorry.

843
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:43,247
You're sorry?

844
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:49,679
Sorry won't bring Irina back.

845
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,397
George, please.

846
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:57,597
How could you live with yourself?

847
00:38:10,484 --> 00:38:12,341
So, we believe her?

848
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:15,021
She might be lying to us,
but she wasn't lying to him.

849
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:17,685
Which makes her the only one
to put Toscu at the scene.

850
00:38:17,685 --> 00:38:19,620
We could have videotape
of him in the act...

851
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,790
we still couldn't touch him
because of his diplomatic immunity.

852
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,192
Alex, there's got to be
something you can do.

853
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:27,920
Let me check with a friend.

854
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:31,757
I need the State Department's help.

855
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:34,187
It's almost impossible to
convince a foreign nation,

856
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,291
even a friendly one...
to waive diplomatic immunity.

857
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,650
Precedent was set
by the former Soviet Union.

858
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,727
The Republic of Georgia waived immunity
on that drunk driving case down in D.C.

859
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:44,620
All those former Soviet Republics

860
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,982
were looking for
most-favored-nation status.

861
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:48,332
I'm looking to put away a murderer,

862
00:38:48,332 --> 00:38:49,940
and I don't care where he's from.

863
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,304
We can always appeal to their decency
and see what happens.

864
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:54,456
What are you suggesting?

865
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:57,326
A long shot.
But it's worth a try.

866
00:38:58,598 --> 00:39:02,902
My government respectfully requests you
to waive Mr. Toscu's diplomatic immunity.

867
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:05,407
That's an extraordinary request.

868
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:07,885
Warranted by
extraordinary circumstances.

869
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:10,460
Mr. Toscu has used his position
to keep women in this country

870
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,129
against their will for the purposes
of prostitution.

871
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:15,013
Now he's a murderer.

872
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:18,704
We didn't invite you here
to be insulted by baseless allegations.

873
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:22,497
Mr. Toscu is a distinguished member
of our diplomatic corps.

874
00:39:22,497 --> 00:39:26,535
Here's what your distinguished diplomat
did to a woman from your own country.

875
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:28,198
Let me see that.

876
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:34,364
Tragic.

877
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,382
And you think I'm responsible?

878
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:39,912
Miss Cabot assures me
that she has an eyewitness...

879
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:44,309
who places Mr. Toscu at the murder scene
carrying the victim's body.

880
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:46,392
Her sister.

881
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:48,193
Ava Parulis?

882
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:50,145
She has quite a reputation.

883
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,267
I'm surprised you'd believe her.

884
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,585
Before we even consider
something as severe...

885
00:39:54,585 --> 00:39:57,560
and irrevocable as waiving
our diplomat's immunity...

886
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,287
we must be convinced of guilt.

887
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:01,973
The evidence is right in front of you.

888
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:04,248
You have nothing but the word of criminals

889
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:08,551
and the eyewitness account of a woman
who buried her sister in a shallow grave.

890
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:12,820
We assert our sovereign rights to protect
our country's diplomat.

891
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,896
And we have the right to protect our country
from your diplomats.

892
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:19,129
Alex. Mr. Davia, you're leaving us
no alternative.

893
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:22,983
My government has authorized me to
declare Mr. Toscu persona non grata.

894
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:26,205
He has 48 hours
to leave the United States.

895
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,214
That's it? He walks?

896
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:33,232
I didn't know
Greenwalt was gonna do that.

897
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:35,676
Why didn't he just
threaten him with expulsion?

898
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:38,546
Jack said, had the Romanians known our 
government was even considering this...

899
00:40:38,546 --> 00:40:40,696
they would have put Toscu
on the first plane to Bucharest.

900
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:42,175
So the bastard murders a woman

901
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:45,268
and his only consequence
is being sent home?

902
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:47,257
At least it bought us some time.

903
00:40:47,257 --> 00:40:48,795
What do you need from us, Alex?

904
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:51,426
Something more than
Ava Parulis' word.

905
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:53,503
But there's nothing left.

906
00:40:53,503 --> 00:40:55,478
We want Toscu,
we need proof he's guilty.

907
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:57,428
Physical evidence.

908
00:40:58,017 --> 00:41:00,164
Go back to the bones.

909
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,609
This report on soil samples
is a real page turner.

910
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:05,222
Very descriptive.
Written from the point of view of a slug.

911
00:41:05,222 --> 00:41:07,148
The good earth
swallowed our evidence.

912
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:08,605
Maybe not all of it.

913
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:10,095
You found something?

914
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:12,701
Irina's clothes were pretty decomposed

915
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:14,995
but they did find a couple of samples
from her panties

916
00:41:14,995 --> 00:41:18,168
and the lab sent them
to a forensic geologist.

917
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:19,979
Where's the report?

918
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,426
Due back next week.

919
00:41:23,426 --> 00:41:25,960
You know how many microorganisms
there are in soil?

920
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,073
If we test everything,

921
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:28,861
you'll still be getting
results 10 years from now.

922
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,273
Yeah. These samples.

923
00:41:30,273 --> 00:41:32,822
Found on what was left of
the victim's clothing.

924
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:37,077
What are those?

925
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,672
Horticulturists use them
to collect and store microscopic pollen.

926
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:44,103
The samples your lab sent us weren't
consistent with the plant life in the area.

927
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:45,854
Okay.
What did your tests show?

928
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:47,545
- I haven't tested them yet.
- When are you gonna test them?

929
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:49,683
- First thing tomorrow morning.
- How about now?

931
00:42:02,798 --> 00:42:05,242
Good morning, Detectives.
Come to see me off?

932
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:07,025
You're not getting away with this.

933
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,956
I'll send you a card
from my next post.

934
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,626
I hope it's a warmer climate.

935
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:13,916
What is this?

936
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:16,278
You're under arrest for the murder
of Irina Burton.

937
00:42:16,278 --> 00:42:18,159
You cannot arrest me
I have diplomatic immunity.

938
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,233
Had diplomatic immunity
until this morning.

939
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:22,426
Your government doesn't appreciate
your sideline business...

940
00:42:22,426 --> 00:42:24,018
as a murderer and a pimp.

941
00:42:24,018 --> 00:42:26,009
- They cut you loose.
- You have no evidence.

942
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,444
Sure we do.

943
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:31,926
Two little grains of pollen belonging to
the Gigas Firmin Lambeau.

944
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,439
- My orchids?
- Found on Irina's clothing.

945
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:36,108
You should have washed your hands
before you murdered her.

946
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:37,337
You have the right to remain silent.

947
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:40,180
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in the court of law...

Detectives.

950
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:52,191
Thank you.

951
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:54,650
Thank us when Toscu's convicted.

952
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,501
We're very sorry for your loss.

953
00:42:55,501 --> 00:42:58,892
We hope everything works out
for you and Julia.

954
00:42:58,892 --> 00:43:00,700
We'll be all right.

955
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:03,045
We have to.

956
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:09,649
Ava could have gone on forever
being Burton's wife,

957
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:11,073
Julia's mother.

958
00:43:11,073 --> 00:43:14,347
- If it hadn't been for the bones.
- Yeah.

959
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:25,545
Irina can rest in peace now.
