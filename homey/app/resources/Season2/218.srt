1
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,079
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,805
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

3
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:30,029
In New York City,

4
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,697
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:36,597
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:38,188
These are their stories.

7
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:45,608
Come on, Annie.
Just one little drink.

8
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:48,135
I can't.
I smell like French fries.

9
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,912
I love French fries.

10
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:52,704
I appreciate the offer, Butch,
but my feet are killing me.

11
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:55,907
I just want to take a hot bath
and curl up with my People.

12
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,533
- Maybe next time.
- All right, I'll hold you to it.

13
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,882
Manana.

14
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:05,947
I love French fries.
How stupid.

15
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:10,669
Annie?

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,483
Annie?

17
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:17,873
- Back off!
- Okay. Okay.

18
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,990
Get off me!

19
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,794
Let him go!

20
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,906
Hey, come back here!

21
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,212
Come back here!
Stop!

22
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:33,838
Annie! Annie!

23
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,406
Abductee's name is Annie Tassler.

24
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:43,007
A waitress at the diner over there.

25
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,769
Why'd you bring us
in on a snatch job?

26
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:46,641
Found this on the scene.

27
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:48,756
- Chloroform?
- Dropped it in the struggle.

28
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:50,574
Took off in a green four-by-four.

29
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:51,906
Witnesses?

30
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:54,350
Butch McGee,
a hash slinger at the diner

31
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,993
and a Good Samaritan
by the name of Marty Potter.

32
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:58,692
They took their lumps
trying to stop him.

33
00:01:58,692 --> 00:01:59,747
Thanks.

34
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:01,486
There's something I'm missing?

35
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:05,335
Last summer, a guy abducted
four women using the same M.O.

36
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,798
Raped and tortured them.

37
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:09,640
Left their bodies stacked
in a warehouse in Alphabet City.

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,326
- The Bowery Stalker?
- One and the same.

39
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:13,081
I haven't heard about that guy
in a long time.

40
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,674
Not long enough.

41
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:16,613
- Butch, Marty?
- Yeah. I'm Butch.

42
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:18,697
What do you got for us?

43
00:02:18,697 --> 00:02:20,564
He pulled her right off the street.

44
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:21,648
Did you get a good look at him?

45
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:24,059
He's a big guy with a beard
and a baseball cap.

46
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,248
You ever seen him before?

47
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:26,970
He might've been
in the diner a few times...

48
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,740
but I never really
got a good look at his face.

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,013
How do you fit into all this?

50
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:31,433
Saw the commotion, tried to help.

51
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:32,543
You have something to add?

52
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:33,928
Yeah. He had a tattoo.

53
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:36,679
A cat of some sort
on his right forearm.

54
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:39,127
I saw it coming at me
when he shoved the gun in my face.

55
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,443
If I put you with a sketch artist,
can you give us a picture?

56
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:43,600
- I can try.
- Sure.

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,727
We gotta get them in the bus.

58
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:45,937
Go.

59
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,194
How long you think the Stalker
will keep her alive?

60
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,081
Until he's finished with her.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/04/20

74
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:46,362
According to Munch, the abductor fits
the Stalker's M.O to a tee.

75
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:49,184
He goes after petite women,
uses chloroform to subdue them

76
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:51,524
and then carts them off
in a dark four-by-four.

77
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:53,090
How long has it been
since his last attack?

78
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,272
Almost a year.

79
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:58,003
Yeah. We thought he'd gone underground,
or maybe just left the area.

80
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:02,249
You're late.

81
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:04,339
I was up all night
interviewing witnesses.

82
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:07,061
D.A. wants an update
on the Bowery Stalker.

83
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,337
Can't wait for the report?

84
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:10,045
She's made this case a top priority.

85
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,407
Any warrants, lab work,
anything you need.

86
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,076
Why all the sudden attention?

87
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:15,744
She knows how elusive he's been.

88
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,101
She thought
you could use some help.

89
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,567
Because I didn't nail him last time?

90
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,593
Come on, John.
Nobody's blaming you.

91
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:24,370
We're all on the same team here.

92
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,835
Then why did you start
the team meeting without me?

93
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:27,857
We were just leaving.

94
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:31,190
No, stay. I want you and Olivia
to help with the canvas.

95
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,217
It's my catch, Captain.
I got it covered.

96
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:34,385
You're still the primary

97
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:36,316
but that doesn't mean
you don't need backup.

98
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:39,372
Now, the only agenda here is
catching this guy before he kills again.

99
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:40,855
Got it?

100
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:43,947
Got it. / Good.
Now where's your partner?

101
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:45,884
He's with a couple of witnesses and
a sketch artist.

102
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:49,266
While you're waiting,
why don't you fill Alex in?

103
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:53,223
- Mind if I get my morning tea first?
- Not at all.

104
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:58,889
About a year ago, Sarah Kimmel
stumbled into a bar on Avenue D...

105
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,481
half naked, beaten,
claiming that a man with a beard...

106
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:04,804
imprisoned her as his sex slave
in an abandoned warehouse on Broome.

107
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,132
We raided it,

108
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:08,033
found a makeshift cell
in the basement...

109
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:11,221
stocked with sex toys
and various instruments of torture.

110
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:13,289
And four mutilated bodies.

111
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:14,845
Any trace evidence?

112
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:18,760
A few partials and DNA,
but nothing our system could match it to.

113
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,356
We staked the building out
for a month. No luck.

114
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:22,799
The guy just disappeared.

115
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,065
Until now.

116
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:25,713
Must have found a new safe house.

117
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,081
Potentially, more victims.

118
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,052
John.

119
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,436
Anything on the tattoo?

120
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:32,557
Butch filled in a few details.
Ran it through PIMS and got a hit.

121
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:35,091
Skel named Frank Taggart,
on parole for assault.

122
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:35,894
Where?

123
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,959
PO said he got a custodial job
at the Fish Market.

124
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,964
How desperate does somebody
gotta be to take a gig in a place like this?

125
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:44,304
Worked here when I was a kid.

126
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:45,763
Made good money, too.

127
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,834
What'd you do with all your money?

128
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,475
You can't tell me women wanted
to get with you

129
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,729
after a day in a flower shop like this.

130
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,475
Two words: Aqua Velva.

131
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:55,393
- Come again?
- Fishmonger's best friend.

132
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:58,748
After a hot shower slather some
of that on. Smell like Vic Damone.

133
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:01,310
Smell like a mackerel
with some cheap aftershave.

134
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,510
Hey! Munch man!

135
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,715
Olive! Hey!

136
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:07,243
Olive?

137
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,737
- Name's Olivetti.
- Okay. Fin. / All right.

138
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,694
Even when we were kids,
he looked like a big, fat Olive. Ergo.

139
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:13,925
Long time, no see.

140
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,290
We're looking for a guy named
Frank Taggart. He still work here?

141
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,089
Yeah. As little as possible.

142
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,856
Where we can find him?

143
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,248
There.

144
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:26,032
Frank Taggart?

145
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,915
We want to talk to you.

146
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,215
Hey, you heard the man.

147
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:33,195
Hold it right there.

148
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,831
This was a new coat.

149
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,915
Two words: Aqua Velva.

150
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,083
That's a hell of a tattoo
you got there, Frankie.

151
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,178
- It's an original.
- Your design?

152
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:48,456
Elmo's Tats on Eighth.
What the hell do you care?

153
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,760
Where were you last night
between 11:00 and midnight?

154
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,481
- Rusty's Bar in the Alphabet.
- Can you prove it?

155
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,254
The barstool near the door
has a permanent imprint of my ass.

156
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:57,479
Feel free to check it out.

157
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:58,924
Be the highlight of our day.

158
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:00,411
Am I being charged with
something here,

159
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,638
or are we just shooting the breeze?

160
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,050
We got witnesses that place you
and your original tattoo...

161
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,460
outside a diner on Canal
Street grabbing a girl,

162
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,283
and pistol-whipping her friend.

163
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:09,651
I was nowhere near the place.

164
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:11,550
Just like you were nowhere
near your girlfriend's place

165
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,089
the night you beat the crap out of her?

166
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,588
That was a misunderstanding.

167
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:17,268
You put your fist
right through her teeth.

168
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:19,914
And I did my time.
And I ain't been near the bitch since.

169
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:21,585
That's why you
grabbed the waitress?

170
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,847
Feeling the need
for a little self-expression?

171
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:25,503
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

172
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:27,200
I didn't grab nobody,

173
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,327
and anybody who says
otherwise is a liar.

174
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:34,706
Bartender at Rusty's said

175
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,929
Taggart ducked out around 11:00
the night of the abduction.

176
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:39,211
Gets him to the diner
with time to spare.

177
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:42,397
- What about the four-by-four?
- Nothing registered to him.

178
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:44,058
Doesn't mean he didn't steal one.

179
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:46,833
Get all the witnesses
down here for a line up,

180
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,326
including Sarah Kimmel.

181
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:51,104
It's been almost a year.

182
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,135
He held her in that warehouse
for two days.

183
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:55,222
I doubt she's gonna forget his face.

184
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:57,028
He messed her up
pretty bad, Captain.

185
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:58,700
If we get the ID off the other two...

186
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,823
Then we'll get a court order
for his DNA to match to her assault.

187
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:04,404
If not, she's our insurance policy.

188
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:14,655
Does one of them have a tattoo?

189
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:18,582
We need you to make
the identification without prejudice.

190
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:22,195
It's the only thing I got a good look at,
besides the gun.

191
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,592
Number 4.

192
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:35,039
No, five.

193
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:38,754
Which is it, Mr. Potter?

194
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:42,027
Five. Definitely five.

195
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:44,316
Thank you, Mr. Potter.

196
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:49,214
Officer Peters will be happy to know

197
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:52,635
he's just been identified
as the Bowery Stalker.

198
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:56,491
I'm sorry, Detective.
It looks like it's up to Sarah.

199
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,872
Is he really here?

200
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:05,367
We have a suspect.
But we need a positive ID.

201
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:08,315
I can't.

202
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,427
He won't be able to see you.

203
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,934
But I see him...

204
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,821
every time I close my eyes.

205
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:21,951
I leave my lights on at night, or I'll see
him staring at me from the shadows.

206
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:24,196
He can't hurt you anymore.

207
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,296
I'm 28.

208
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:32,032
I'm living on disability because I can't
leave my house without falling apart.

209
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:35,838
Don't tell me
that he can't hurt me.

210
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:39,505
I wouldn't ask you to do this
unless I had to.

211
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:42,631
But we think he's hurting
somebody else.

212
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:58,685
Whenever you're ready, Sarah.

213
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:13,238
- You see him, don't you?
- Detective.

214
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,826
Which one, Sarah? Which one?

215
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,099
He's not there.

216
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,971
It's okay.

217
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,436
It's all right.

218
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,819
It's all right.

219
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:36,101
Sarah.

220
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:40,354
Thank you for the ride home.

221
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,410
Damn!

222
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:46,798
You didn't have a choice.

223
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:48,701
I was sure we had him.
What the hell are we missing?

224
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:49,909
I was just thinking.

225
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,792
Taggart said his tattoo
was an original.

226
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:53,332
Right. Elmo's Tats on Eighth.

227
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:57,449
I wonder how many Elmo originals
are walking around Manhattan?

228
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,736
- Hell of a work of art.
- If you say so.

229
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:03,611
It ain't mine.

230
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:06,036
Guy brought it in last summer,
asked me to do a tat.

231
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:08,201
Liked my work so much,
he left me the sketch as a bonus.

232
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,362
How many have you done
since then?

233
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,429
Can count them on one hand.

234
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,399
Most folks are into Goth
these days.

235
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,213
You keep names and addresses?

236
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,166
It's not exactly that kind of business.

237
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,898
But the ones who want that one
are hard to forget.

238
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:21,018
Such as?

239
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:23,250
An old dude who walked
his cat on a leash.

240
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,912
A woman wrestler.
A guy who smelled like rotten fish.

241
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:28,479
- And the one that brought it in.
- What'd he look like?

242
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,332
Big fellow with a beard.

243
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:32,915
He said the bobcat
was a platoon name in the service.

244
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:34,665
You mind if we take
that sketch with us?

245
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:37,513
Why not? It's not exactly bringing in
the foot traffic.

246
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:41,339
Forensic Investigations Division
Jamaica, Queens
Friday, April 6

247
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,314
I saturated the paper with ninhydrin

248
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:45,299
which revealed two distinct sets of prints.

249
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,001
One matched to the shop owner,
the other was a John Doe.

250
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:52,080
Damn. / Until I ran it against
the alternate data banks.

251
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:55,568
"Darryl R. Kern.

252
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:58,967
Dishonorably discharged
from the Army in 1999."

253
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,064
About the same time
the attacks started.

254
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:04,072
How much you want to bet
DMV turns up a green four-by-four.

255
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,879
And a home address.

256
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:09,933
Right there.

257
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:19,908
Darryl Kern? This is the NYPD.

258
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,787
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

259
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,951
If you don't open the door,
we'll open it for you.

260
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:27,420
Take it down.

261
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:28,935
Police! Let's go!

262
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,198
Go! Go!

263
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,503
Cool cat.

264
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,476
Fin.

265
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:41,220
Take a look at this.
E-Z Pass bill.

266
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,413
This guy does some
serious traveling.

267
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,974
And always to the same place.

268
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:49,237
Kern's E-Z Pass statements
show periodic travel

269
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:51,836
along the same route
dating back to last June.

270
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:54,109
From Manhattan he goes across
the Triborough Bridge

271
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:56,438
onto the thruway,
across the Tappan Zee...

272
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:59,283
north to Utica, where he exits
on to Route 12 North.

273
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:02,514
Credit cards show him gassing up
his '92 Pathfinder

274
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:05,746
along Routes 12 and 11,
all the way up to Walden Falls...

275
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:09,108
a pit stop of a town 20 miles northeast
of Watertown.

276
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:11,209
A few days later, he takes
the same route back to the city.

277
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,624
Seven women went missing
within a day of each of these trips.

278
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:17,510
You got a lot
of unspoiled wilderness up there.

279
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:20,065
There's only one way to find him.

280
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:24,503
Munch, Fin, pack your bags.
You're going on a road trip.

281
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:32,127
- Where's Op?
- Probably gone fishing.

282
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:34,881
Speaking of which,
you look a little green around the gills.

283
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,322
Maybe it's because riding with you

284
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:38,770
is like taking a four hour spin on
the Tilt-a-World.

285
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,075
- I told you to take the Dramamine.
- I hate pills.

286
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:44,063
- So you'd rather puke.
- I'm not gonna puke.

287
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,371
But you could use a road course
on driving in hazardous conditions.

288
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:49,658
- I kept it on the road.
- Barely.

289
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,596
The locals been briefed?

290
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:54,554
Yeah. Cragen took care of it.
He faxed them the whole file.

291
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:57,359
Assuming they have
a fax machine in Mayberry.

292
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,373
Chief, the detectives
from New York City are here.

293
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,562
Welcome to Walden Falls.

294
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:04,961
John Munch.

295
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,643
Odafin Tutuola.

296
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:07,714
Come again?

297
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,744
- Just call me Fin.
- Fin. Got it.

298
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:11,827
Get you a cup of coffee?
Soda pop? Something?

299
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:12,824
We're fine.

300
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:14,669
So, you think you've got
a fugitive hiding out up here?

301
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:18,653
Cold-blooded serial killer
and rapist by the name of Darryl Kern.

302
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:21,060
I never heard of him.
I know just about everybody in town.

303
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,781
So if he's here,
he's keeping a low profile.

304
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,896
Come on in, Cheryl.

305
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:28,653
This is Detectives Munch and...

306
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:29,976
Fin.

307
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:31,547
Officer Cheryl Baxter.

308
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:34,715
Whatever you need,
Officer Baxter is at your disposal.

309
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:36,478
We'd like to start with
Smitty's Pump and Save.

310
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:38,791
'Cause that seems to be
a regular stop on Kern's itinerary.

311
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,683
You want to settle in first,
or go now?

312
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:43,298
The woman he grabbed might
still be alive. We can settle in later.

313
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:44,119
Good luck.

314
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:46,167
If you need anything else,
just give a holler.

315
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,971
- Thanks, Chief.
- You betcha.

316
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,947
Guy's from out of town.
Has a cabin up here.

317
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:53,630
- Know where?
- No.

318
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,900
But he likes to hunt,

319
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,679
so I suppose it's out
on one of the county roads.

320
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,319
Lots of folks
have hunting shacks out there.

321
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,759
Was anyone with him?

322
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,704
I think he might have a lady friend.

323
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:03,311
Is this her?

324
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,325
Hard to tell.

325
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,812
You said he liked to hunt.

326
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:08,308
He never really said so...

327
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,420
but since he spends so much time
in Jordie's Guns and Ammo

328
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,178
I figured he was stocking up
for the season.

329
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,300
Where's
Jordie's Guns and Ammo?

330
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,580
Right over there.

331
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,879
Thank you.

332
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:20,070
Yeah. That's Arnold Cokely.

333
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,943
- Cokely?
- That's what I said.

334
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:23,498
I heard he comes in here a lot.

335
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:24,543
Is there a law against that?

336
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:26,998
No, but there is a law
against obstructing justice.

337
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:28,822
Come on, Jordie.
They're okay.

338
00:15:28,822 --> 00:15:31,381
They're just trying to do their jobs.

339
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:33,102
What do you need?

340
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:35,170
Did he mention anything
about a cabin?

341
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,019
I think he said it was north of town.

342
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,925
Kept it pretty well stocked, too.

343
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:40,562
With what?

344
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:44,191
Rifles, ammo, provisions.
We carry a full line here.

345
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:46,678
Do you mind if we take a look
at his paperwork?

346
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:49,124
Yeah, I do mind.

347
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,788
Jordie.

348
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:56,267
But I don't suppose
there's much I can do about it.

349
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,729
Government's got its fingers
so far up everyone's ass

350
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:02,082
it's getting to be like
Russia around here.

351
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:04,042
Russia's a democracy now.

352
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,232
My point exactly.

353
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:09,181
I assume you checked his ID
and waited for his background to clear.

354
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:10,698
Yeah. I followed the law.

355
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:13,043
To the letter, if not the spirit.

356
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:15,647
We'll get this back to you.

357
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:21,607
We computerized the county records
a few years ago.

358
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,753
If either Kern or Cokely
owns land here,

359
00:16:23,753 --> 00:16:25,408
it'll show up on the tax rolls.

360
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:28,001
Damn. How come we don't have
this kind of software?

361
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,379
You could always head down to the
basement and go through the big books

362
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,575
if that'd make you feel more at home.

363
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,187
Just got off the phone
with New York.

364
00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,528
Benson called Missing Persons.

365
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:40,037
Arnold Cokely and his wife Amanda
went missing from Tribeca five months ago.

366
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:43,633
And since Cokely's ID was used in
a fraudulent firearms transaction...

367
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,287
ATF is joining the party.

368
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,582
That may not be so bad,

369
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:50,143
considering all the firepower
Kern's been stockpiling.

370
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:51,204
Sorry.

371
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,275
No match for Kern or Cokely
in the system.

372
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:56,790
She faxed a list of others that went missing
around the time of his other trips.

373
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,005
Can you check on those, too?

374
00:16:58,005 --> 00:16:59,455
I'll scan the names
into the computer,

375
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:01,217
have a printout in a few minutes.

376
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:04,695
Blackbird Motor Lodge
Walden Falls, New York
Monday, April 9

377
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:07,415
I still don't see why the city
couldn't spring for two rooms.

378
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:08,762
Because they're cheap.

379
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,801
The D.A. wants to redecorate her office
with antiques and Berber rugs,

380
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:13,823
and we gotta beg
for table scraps.

381
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,730
In Narcotics we always got
our own rooms.

382
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,335
Sometimes entire apartments.

383
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:18,417
How's that?

384
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:19,560
Undercover.

385
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,705
Gotta create entirely new identities.

386
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:25,233
You know, apartments,
bank accounts, the whole works.

387
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,501
One time I was under
for seven weeks.

388
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:29,927
Had a nice little duplex in The Village.

389
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,321
After we bust the dope ring,

390
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:34,843
I gotta move back to my little cracker box
one-bedroom in Brooklyn.

391
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:37,595
First week home, I kept bumping into
my own furniture.

392
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:39,522
So this place must make you feel
right at home.

393
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:40,543
Not exactly.

394
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:44,532
I got a nice entertainment system,
surround sound and a widescreen TV.

395
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,888
Eight months of the cold shoulder,
now I can't shut you up.

396
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,108
So why'd you leave Narcotics?

397
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:57,275
My partner took a bullet
that was meant for me.

398
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:01,333
Sort of took all the fun out of it.

399
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,214
Why'd you leave Homicide?

400
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:06,286
I came back from Baltimore
after my last marriage broke up.

401
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,854
The only opening
in my bracket was SVU.

402
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,142
Seen enough dead bodies,
figured the change would do me good.

403
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:16,124
Little did I know, it's the living victims
that rip your guts out.

404
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:17,625
That mine or yours?

405
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,058
It's yours.

406
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:20,971
Where the hell did I...

407
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,788
Munch.

408
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:26,481
Hey, Elliott.

409
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,235
Blueprints?

410
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:31,886
Yeah. We're on it.

411
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:33,075
Where's the phone book?

412
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:34,404
Right here.

413
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:36,556
I used it to order the pizza.

414
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,332
More like a wallet.

415
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:40,755
- Here it is.
- What?

416
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,270
They've been combing through
Kern's stuff...

417
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,499
found blueprints for a bomb shelter drawn
up by a contractor in Walden Falls.

418
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:47,949
Cheryl? John Munch.

419
00:18:47,949 --> 00:18:51,619
Do you know the owner
of McCartney Lumber and Cement?

420
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:53,327
Could you have him
meet us at the station?

421
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:54,845
We caught a break in the case.

422
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,359
See you in 20.

423
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,093
This is a federal matter.

424
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:01,141
And this is my office.
Play by my rules or get out.

425
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,562
You're in over your head.

426
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:05,443
This man has enough firepower
to start World War III.

427
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:08,409
Somebody's blowing enough hot air
to refloat the Hindenburg.

428
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,007
- Who the hell are you?
- Det. John Munch, NYPD.

429
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:11,837
Who the hell are you?

430
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:14,468
Gus Stone,
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

431
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:16,977
Mr. Stone, why don't you
take your cowboys and step aside...

432
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:18,599
and let the police do their work?

433
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,723
I have a federal warrant
for Darryl Kern's arrest.

434
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,522
And I have someone
who could help find him

435
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:23,940
before he kills another innocent woman.

436
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,228
Who trumps who?

437
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:26,646
Here they are.

438
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:36,168
Mr. McCartney, do you recognize
these blueprints?

439
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:37,934
Sure do.

440
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:40,562
Guy came in last June, asking
us to build him a bunker.

441
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:41,881
For what?

442
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,732
Said he was getting ready
for Armageddon and the race wars.

443
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:46,226
I don't subscribe
to that point of view,

444
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,309
but his money's as green as anyone's.

445
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:50,528
Drew up the plans to his specifications.

446
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:54,113
An underground bunker
fortified with 12-inch cement blocks.

447
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:55,547
- You built it?
- Sure did.

448
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:56,351
Where?

449
00:19:56,351 --> 00:20:00,206
Tract of land about 10 miles out,
just off County Road 26.

450
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:02,249
Already had a small cabin on it.

451
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:05,312
I can have 10 men here, deputized,
ready to go within an hour.

452
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:07,451
I've got five more
on the way from Watertown.

453
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:08,986
What are we waiting for?

454
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:39,539
Go.

455
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:46,317
- ATF.
- Police!

456
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,399
Nothing?

457
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:55,772
Clear.

458
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:00,705
Where the hell is he?

459
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:02,067
Detectives!

460
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:15,767
We got something here.

461
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:32,220
Sorry, Annie.

462
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,933
John?

463
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:46,141
Bastard tortured her.

464
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,693
The frozen ground's
slowing us down

465
00:21:56,693 --> 00:22:00,842
but we've already uncovered
15 bodies buried in shallow graves.

466
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,596
Three kids.

467
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,128
Why kids?

468
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:07,682
I've got my men scouring the woods

469
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:09,611
but by the looks of those tire tracks...

470
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:13,263
I'd say Kern pulled out
a good hour before we got here.

471
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:16,243
Somebody's tipped him off.

472
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,858
I could've lived an entire lifetime without
seeing something like this.

473
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:23,074
How bad?

474
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:25,013
Contusions, broken bones,

475
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:26,976
flesh pulped and bruised.

476
00:22:26,976 --> 00:22:30,296
Mutilation pattern suggests she'd been
penetrated by foreign objects...

477
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:32,316
possibly a knife.

478
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:35,710
All that before he blew her face off
with a.44.

479
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,629
Detective?

480
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:39,958
Found something in the cabin
you might want to take a look at.

481
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:43,405
It's an operation manual
of some sort.

482
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,525
Last entry dated yesterday.

483
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:46,835
"Position compromised.

484
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:48,465
"As long as the Worm stays
in the Apple,

485
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,646
"possibility of further erosion.

486
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:53,651
"Will rendezvous at extraction point.
Operation terminated."

487
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:55,259
He definitely has an accomplice.

488
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:57,822
Serial killers tend to be loners.
But when they do pair off,

489
00:22:57,822 --> 00:23:00,117
the stronger personality dominates.

490
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,909
We read a single perp because
his partner lives in his shadow.

491
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:05,017
He must have left in one big hurry
to forget this.

492
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,272
He's slipping.

493
00:23:06,272 --> 00:23:08,798
It says they're going
to rendezvous.

494
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:11,718
- The Worm's in the Apple.
- The Big Apple.

495
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:13,354
He's heading back to the city.

496
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:17,110
Special Victims Unit
Wednesday, April 11

497
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,115
It's all written
in this pseudo-military code.

498
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:22,481
He calls his accomplice the Worm
and refers to himself as the Eagle.

499
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,317
And lists targets and ops
dating back three years.

500
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,277
I assume the targets
are the victims.

501
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:30,026
- And the ops...
- Their torture and execution.

502
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:32,627
He's killed entire families
for their credit cards and ID.

503
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:34,566
He even killed
one guy for his cabin.

504
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,634
A plumber from Brooklyn
named Ernest Dillman.

505
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:38,016
Now that the operation's
gone south

506
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,386
he's come home to scoop up
his accomplice and hit the road.

507
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,777
Any idea who this accomplice is?

508
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:46,200
We figure he's an Army buddy

509
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,860
since they communicate
using this military jargon.

510
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,776
Kern was stationed at Fort Dix
according to his discharge papers.

511
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:55,994
I know somebody at the 15
close to the CO.

512
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,977
Let me see if I can hook you up.

513
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:02,637
It's an elite group trained for
specialized tactical operations.

514
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:05,467
- Kern's outfit?
- Mine, in the Gulf War.

515
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:08,148
The closest Kern ever got
to an operation of any significance

516
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:10,433
was running to the cellar
for a batch of potatoes.

517
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,497
He was a cook?

518
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:13,164
He was trained
as a weapons specialist

519
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:14,929
but he spent so much time in KP...

520
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:17,412
we reassigned him to the kitchen
on a permanent basis.

521
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,791
- How'd he take to that?
- He didn't.

522
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,160
Kern had a problem with authority

523
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,154
which is why he had a problem
with the Army.

524
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:24,426
Why'd he sign up?

525
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:27,024
He suffered under the delusion
we enjoy killing things.

526
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:29,328
That attitude eventually earned him
his discharge.

527
00:24:29,328 --> 00:24:31,087
Can you be a little more specific?

528
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:34,009
We had this squirrel,
used to hang out behind the mess.

529
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:37,027
Cooks would feed him
table scraps, nuts.

530
00:24:37,027 --> 00:24:38,528
One day, the dinner shift arrived

531
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:41,722
to find Kern dumping strange meat
into the stew pot.

532
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:43,793
When they asked
what the hell he was doing...

533
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:48,704
he pointed out the window to a squirrel
hide laid out to dry in the bushes.

534
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:50,754
Said he needed a new hat.

535
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,744
One of the cooks jumped him.
Kern threatened him with a butcher knife.

536
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:56,790
He wound up in the brig,
where he underwent psych testing.

537
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,489
He was diagnosed with anti-social
personality disorder...

538
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:00,853
and pronounced unfit for duty.

539
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:04,148
So you kicked him out of the Army and
unleashed him on the rest of us.

540
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:05,355
He did his time.

541
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:06,874
We didn't have anything
to hold him on.

542
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:09,097
Did he have any friends,
anyone he hung with?

543
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,506
He pretty much stayed to himself...

544
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:14,238
except for a guy who made dry goods
deliveries to the mess.

545
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:16,551
They seemed to be
on the same wavelength.

546
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:18,499
Can we talk to this guy?

547
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:19,863
He doesn't deliver here anymore,

548
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:21,445
but I could give you
the name of the company.

549
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:23,246
Some outfit out of Brooklyn.

550
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,867
Magoo's Vending Company
Gowanus, Brooklyn
Wednesday, April 11

551
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,662
- That's Marvin.
- Marvin who?

552
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:30,465
Marvin Posey.
He's one of my best guys.

553
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:32,399
He's been with
the company eight years.

554
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:34,430
He took the job the same day Clinton
took office.

555
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,397
You ever fire the guy,
you better nail down the furniture.

556
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:37,840
Where can we find Marvin?

557
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,263
He ain't working today.
He's on National Guard maneuvers.

558
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:43,661
- Marvin's a weekend warrior?
- You bet.

559
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:45,848
Did anybody notice
today's Thursday?

560
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,684
Sometimes the maneuvers
go all week.

561
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:50,012
I don't mind. At least he's doing
his patriotic duty.

562
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:52,329
Which is more than I can say
for half the lazy slackers around here.

563
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:53,285
Excuse me.

564
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,412
Hey, numb nuts!
You wanna smoke that whole pack...

565
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:57,887
or you think you might make your run
sometime today?

566
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,057
How often does Marvin
go on these maneuvers?

567
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:02,072
Once a month.

568
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,432
Sometimes less,
sometimes more.

569
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:05,746
- When did he leave this time?
- Couple of days ago.

570
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:07,631
I expect him back Monday,
if you wanna talk to him.

571
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:09,298
No, we need to see him
before that.

572
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:10,486
Do you have a home address?

573
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,692
Sure. But he ain't there.

574
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:14,354
He's out in the wilderness
somewhere practicing survival skills.

575
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:17,056
We're gonna need
his address for our files.

576
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:19,021
He's not in trouble, is he?

577
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,700
In position, Detective.

578
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,900
Stand by.

579
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,201
Marvin Posey. NYPD.
Open up.

580
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:38,899
We want to talk to you.

581
00:26:42,863 --> 00:26:44,287
Come on, Marvin!

582
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:54,760
Hello. Marvin's not here.

583
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,882
Where is he?

584
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,717
He left this morning.

585
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,883
Are you friends of his?

586
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:06,013
I hope you like orange pekoe.

587
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:10,063
Marvin was going to pick up
some Earl Grey from the store...

588
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:13,478
- when he got called away.
- Let me help you with that.

589
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:18,090
Friends stop by so seldom.

590
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:20,741
I know he'll be disappointed
he missed you.

591
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:22,308
You Marvin's mother?

592
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,108
No, I'm his Aunt Mary.

593
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:27,166
His mother died
when he was just a child.

594
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,664
I'm sorry.

595
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:31,506
His father beat his mother
to death with an iron.

596
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:33,689
He didn't like the way
she did his shirts.

597
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:35,614
Milk with your tea?

598
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:37,018
No, thank you.

599
00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:40,101
It's so hard on a child
to lose a parent.

600
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:44,557
That's why I was determined
to give Marvin all the love I could.

601
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:46,317
Raised him like my own.

602
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:48,650
It wasn't easy,
but we got through.

603
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,015
He's always been a loving boy.

604
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:52,448
Ms...

605
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,050
Call me Aunt Mary.

606
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,182
Aunt Mary, it's very important
that we get in touch with Marvin.

607
00:27:57,182 --> 00:27:58,668
Do you know where he might be?

608
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:00,390
It's a secret.

609
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,692
He's with the Green Berets.

610
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:04,859
That's his scrapbook, right there.

611
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:07,434
- You mind?
- No, please.

612
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,903
Even when he hurt his leg
on the last mission

613
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:13,517
he just turned right around
and volunteered again.

614
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:14,830
How can we get in touch with him?

615
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,002
He usually takes his cell phone,

616
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:20,244
in case of an emergency.

617
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:24,327
That's Marvin with his friend Darryl.

618
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:27,065
Do you know Darryl, too?

619
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,596
You could say that.

620
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:33,663
Damn.

621
00:28:34,188 --> 00:28:36,127
We had him. In our own house.

622
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:37,716
He wasn't trying to stop
the four-by-four.

623
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,705
He was trying to get in.

624
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:40,104
How could we be so stupid?

625
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,467
We weren't the only ones.
Even Aunt Mary thinks he's a hero.

626
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:45,770
Aunt Mary's a few tea bags shy
of a full pot.

627
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:52,163
Damn it! I should've seen it the minute
he picked Peters out of the line up.

628
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,671
Get an APB out on Marvin and his Aunt
Mary's Chrysler New Yorker.

629
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:58,099
Yeah. Got it.

630
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:00,070
State Police found Kern's Pathfinder

631
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,471
at a shopping center
outside of Walden Falls.

632
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:05,122
They said a bald,
clean-shaven man got out of it

633
00:29:05,122 --> 00:29:07,786
carjacked a mother and her kid
in a blue Taurus.

634
00:29:07,786 --> 00:29:08,990
- When?
- This morning.

635
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,566
- What direction were they headed?
- North.

636
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:14,647
Canada. Damn.

637
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:19,954
So Marty Potter is Marvin Posey.

638
00:29:19,954 --> 00:29:21,391
No wonder Kern knew we were
on his tail.

639
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,965
His accomplice
had the inside scoop.

640
00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:24,616
The question is, where is he now?

641
00:29:24,616 --> 00:29:27,800
State Police says Kern
was alone when he jacked that Taurus.

642
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,885
A new look, car,
traveling companions,

643
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,394
it's easy to slip
through the perimeter.

644
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,764
Maybe even cross the border.

645
00:29:32,764 --> 00:29:35,528
If he has, those hostages
don't have much shelf life.

646
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:37,652
Got the LUDS
on Marvin's cell phone.

647
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:41,387
He received a call from Annie Tassler's
cell the morning after the abduction.

648
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:42,388
Kern.

649
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:45,391
And they've been exchanging
calls at regular intervals ever since.

650
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:46,736
Marvin didn't leave until this morning.

651
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:49,817
If they're meeting up on the road,
we could trace them through cell sites.

652
00:29:49,817 --> 00:29:53,111
Call the service provider.
Get a trap on both numbers.

653
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:56,858
The two blips represent calls exchanged

654
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:59,098
between the two cell phones
over the past two days.

655
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:02,058
Now, I've connected the blips
of each phone to demonstrate...

656
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:05,098
how the signal has been passed
from one cell site to the next

657
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:08,180
which basically represents
their respective travel routes.

658
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,654
Looks like Marvin's hauling ass.

659
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:11,390
Yeah. And Kern's been hunkering down.

660
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,125
Cell phones converge
in a cell site outside Fisher's Landing.

661
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:18,072
Just this side
of the Canadian border.

662
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,478
Give me the State Police.

663
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:26,140
Pack the Dramamine.
We're heading north.

664
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:42,164
We spotted a blue Taurus
and a Chrysler New Yorker

665
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:44,992
in the driveway of a farmhouse
about a half mile down the road.

666
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,432
Anybody see
the mother and kid?

667
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:48,816
No. We suspect they're holed up
inside the house.

668
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:50,949
There's a stand of trees
lining the road.

669
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,115
Can't see us
until we're in the driveway.

670
00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:54,763
Might be able to surprise them.

671
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:55,970
It's your show.

672
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,544
All right. Let's move out.

673
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:38,932
ATF! Go!

674
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:01,088
God.

675
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:11,890
You son of a bitch!

676
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:16,688
He's playing us like fools.

677
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:18,282
He still needs the mother and kid.

678
00:32:18,282 --> 00:32:19,942
But for how long?

679
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:24,708
We've got an APB out
on the farmer's pickup.

680
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,284
Customs and Canadians
are on alert. We'll get him.

681
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:28,939
How many more die
before we do?

682
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:31,128
He's running out of steam.

683
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:32,561
So am I.

684
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:35,216
Guess what? That was Cragen.

685
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:37,260
Canadians just arrested Kern
for shoplifting

686
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,359
outside an auto parts store
in Mallorytown, just across the border.

687
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,711
Shoplifting?

688
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,696
The farmer's truck
had a bad alternator.

689
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:45,937
- What about...
- Mom and kid are fine.

690
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:47,734
They found them tied up
in the back of the truck.

691
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:51,859
Provincial Police are holding Kern
until we get there, on Cragen's request.

692
00:32:55,276 --> 00:32:58,918
Ontario Provincial Police Detachment
Thursday, April 12

693
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:00,405
Where is he?

694
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:01,886
In a holding cell.

695
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:03,398
What are you doing here?

696
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,581
Serving the extradition warrant,
which Kern's fighting, naturally.

697
00:33:06,581 --> 00:33:07,556
On what grounds?

698
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:10,160
Serial rape and murder
make book over shoplifting, don't they?

699
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,169
We still have to make our argument in
Canadian courts.

700
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:13,422
How are the hostages?

701
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:15,231
Aside from mild exposure,
they're fine.

702
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:17,931
- At least physically.
- I'd like to talk to them.

703
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:25,705
Ms. Michaelson?

704
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:28,087
I'm Det. Munch of the NYPD.

705
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:30,194
This is Det. Tutuola...

706
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:32,914
and Assistant District
Attorney Alexandra Cabot.

707
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:34,476
How long will this take?

708
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:38,308
I want to be in the hospital
when my daughter wakes up.

709
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:40,250
Just a few questions.

710
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,619
I told the other police
everything I know.

711
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,789
The Canadians have their own charges
they want to investigate.

712
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:47,868
We need to ask you about the time
you spent with Kern

713
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,420
before you crossed the border.

714
00:33:52,757 --> 00:33:56,008
Did he have a weapon when he abducted
you and your daughter?

715
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:57,222
A knife.

716
00:33:57,222 --> 00:34:01,539
He pressed it against my ribs
and told me to move over.

717
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:04,483
- Where was your daughter?
- In the backseat.

718
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:07,146
He threatened to kill her.

719
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,917
What happened
when you got to the farmhouse?

720
00:34:10,686 --> 00:34:13,053
He held the knife to my back...

721
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,795
and he led me to the front door.

722
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:20,070
An old woman answered
and he asked her for directions.

723
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,012
When she turned her back...

724
00:34:23,012 --> 00:34:26,845
he cut her throat.

725
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,452
What about her husband?

726
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:35,397
He came running from the kitchen.

727
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:39,314
Before he could say a word,
Kern cut his throat, too.

728
00:34:39,314 --> 00:34:40,855
Was his buddy there?

729
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:43,407
No. He came later.

730
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:46,548
Kern said he had something
to show him in the barn.

731
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:50,546
I heard the most horrific screams.

732
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:53,936
Kern came out covered in blood.

733
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:57,108
He went into the house,
changed his clothes

734
00:34:57,108 --> 00:35:00,067
and made us get into
the farmer's pickup

735
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:02,410
like nothing had ever happened.

736
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,986
He said we were going
to Canada and...

737
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:13,932
Please, tell me.

738
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:21,561
He said he was going to kill me and Jenny
just like the rest of them.

739
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:25,563
He said the police were so stupid,
they'd never find us.

740
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:39,098
Marvin was alive
when Kern gutted him.

741
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:41,762
He might be laying the groundwork
for an insanity plea.

742
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,531
He'll never admit to insanity.

743
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:44,534
We've got the journal

744
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:46,868
and we're cross-matching
DNA samples from the bunker.

745
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:51,225
But a confession would really
strengthen our argument
at the extradition hearing.

746
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,156
Tell the Provincials
I want to be alone with him.

747
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,294
Shoplifting.

748
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:11,964
Kind of an undignified end
to such an ambitious operation.

749
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,507
Still, it was masterful.

750
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:19,564
You had us stumped
for over a year, Darryl.

751
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:22,536
Your operations manual...
reads like a textbook in tactics

752
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:24,739
and resource management.

753
00:36:25,687 --> 00:36:29,082
I've offered it to the curriculum committee
at the Academy.

754
00:36:29,082 --> 00:36:33,430
I think the next generation
of cops can learn a lot from you.

755
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,659
But these academics.

756
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:39,011
They just want to focus
on your mistakes.

757
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,902
What mistakes?

758
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:44,779
Sarah Kimmel, for example.

759
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:48,000
Who? / The woman who escaped
from the warehouse.

760
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,224
Your first mistake.

761
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:51,125
That was Marvin's fault.

762
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,917
I had to leave to go to work.

763
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:55,816
Marvin swore he'd be there
in no more than five minutes.

764
00:36:55,816 --> 00:37:01,441
Half hour later, I get a panic call saying
that the target had disappeared.

765
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:04,964
- I should've eliminated him then.
- Why didn't you?

766
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:07,033
He served a purpose.

767
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:08,609
He hooked me up with Ernie.

768
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:10,782
The guy who owns the cabin?

769
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:12,668
He was a friend of Marvin's.

770
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:16,822
Used to yak that it was this perfect refuge
from the liberal hordes.

771
00:37:16,822 --> 00:37:19,665
Got him to take me up there
during hunting season.

772
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:22,068
That's when I got the idea.

773
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:24,081
He never saw it coming, did he?

774
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:26,516
He was taking a leak
in the bushes.

775
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:28,637
I just walked up behind him,

776
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:31,105
drew the blade across his throat.

777
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,623
One clean slice.

778
00:37:32,623 --> 00:37:34,516
And Shangri-la was yours.

779
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:37,917
So Ernie was just means to an end.

780
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:41,249
The trick was using the credit cards
and IDs in different places

781
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:43,301
so that no one could trace him.

782
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:45,268
Same story with the Cokelys?

783
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:48,630
Met him in a bar in Walden Falls.

784
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,373
Said he was passing through
from Syracuse.

785
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:54,571
Only problem was
he had his wife with him.

786
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:56,298
So she had to go, too.

787
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,064
Not right away,

788
00:37:58,064 --> 00:38:00,407
but after a few days.

789
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:02,609
Why the bunker?

790
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:06,048
Didn't like to eat where I worked.

791
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,757
And it was more secure.

792
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:12,513
How many?

793
00:38:15,184 --> 00:38:17,578
We found 18 of them.

794
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:20,094
Oh, there's more.

795
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,097
How many?

796
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,223
That would be telling.

797
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,637
You pathetic piece of...

798
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:33,784
Come on, Detective. You should be
used to this by now.

799
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:37,351
I've been one step ahead of you
since you stormed the warehouse.

800
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:40,740
Every time I grabbed another target,
I thought about you.

801
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,747
And when they were screaming
for mercy

802
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:48,763
I had a little laugh at your expense
like I'm having a little laugh right now,

803
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:51,574
because you think you've won.

804
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:55,149
I'm gonna have my own little laugh

805
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:57,511
when I watch them
stick the needle in your arm.

806
00:38:57,511 --> 00:39:00,903
Canada won't extradite on capital offenses
unless you waive the death penalty.

807
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:04,452
Or maybe they didn't teach you
that at the Academy.

808
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:10,304
He says they won't extradite
on capital offenses?

809
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:12,755
The Canadian Supreme Court
tightened their restrictions last year.

810
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:14,953
So he can flip us off
from Canadian prison?

811
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,867
He can make the argument.
That doesn't mean he'll win.

812
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:19,011
He saves his neck, he wins.

813
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:20,636
Look...

814
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:23,769
I did not come all the way up here
to go home empty-handed.

815
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:27,061
John, you did your job.
Now let me do mine.

816
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,107
Ontario Superior Court of Justice
Friday, April 13

817
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:37,015
The Supreme Court was unequivocal
in its 90 ruling

818
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:40,448
under the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms of the Canadian constitution

819
00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:44,218
concerning the matter
of extradition on capital offenses.

820
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,585
Mr. Picard,

821
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:49,188
aren't you concerned that Canada might
become a safe haven for criminals...

822
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:53,495
seeking to use our constitution as
a shield from prosecution?

823
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:57,017
I prefer not to speculate
on hypothetical situations

824
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:59,905
which may or may not result
from the High Court's ruling.

825
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:04,377
I can only ask this court
to interpret the law as written.

826
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,743
Madam Prosecutor?

827
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:08,834
While I do respect
the High Court's rulings

828
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:11,312
in the matter of constitutional rights
and protections

829
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:13,440
I would submit this ruling does not apply

830
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,512
in the case for which the State of New York
seeks extradition.

831
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:18,747
Is not murder
with special circumstances

832
00:40:18,747 --> 00:40:21,485
attached a capital offense
under New York law?

833
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,835
It is, Your Honor.

834
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:26,087
However, the People are not
seeking extradition on the capital offense.

835
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:29,098
We are here on the sole charge
of possession of stolen property.

836
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:33,457
Your Honor, this is a blatant attempt
to circumvent the laws of this land.

837
00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:36,769
Since the value of the stolen
automobile exceeds $5,000...

838
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:41,276
it is my understanding, this qualifies
for extradition under Canadian law.

839
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:44,069
Your petition cited multiple
charges of murder

840
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,442
and two counts of kidnapping.

841
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,839
It is true that Mr. Kern and his accomplice
brutally raped, tortured,

842
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,582
and maimed their subjects
before killing them.

843
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,898
However, we have amended our petition
to reflect only the lesser offense.

844
00:40:54,898 --> 00:40:57,644
Your Honor,
this is a cynical ploy.

845
00:40:57,644 --> 00:41:00,423
We all know that once Mr. Kern
crosses the border

846
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:02,978
he will be charged
with the capital crimes.

847
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:04,808
Perhaps, Mr. Picard.

848
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:08,706
But this court prefers not to speculate
on hypothetical situations

849
00:41:08,706 --> 00:41:12,397
which may or may not result
from its ruling.

850
00:41:12,397 --> 00:41:14,011
Now...

851
00:41:14,011 --> 00:41:17,244
the petition for extradition is granted.

852
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:58,247
Detectives, take custody
of the prisoner.

853
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,027
Darryl Kern, you are under arrest
for the murders of Ernest Dillman...

854
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:06,094
Arnold and Amanda Cokely,
and Annie Tassler.

855
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,394
Welcome home, Darryl.

856
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,561
Thanks.

857
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,136
I just wanted to tell you,
you can turn your lights out tonight.

858
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:07,814
