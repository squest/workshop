2
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:25,242
In the criminal justice system,

3
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:28,890
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,178
In New York City,

5
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:33,556
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

6
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:36,681
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

7
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:38,631
These are their stories.

8
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:43,743
What do you say?
Cover my shift on Friday?

9
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:47,073
I told you, I got to spend the day
with the wife and her mother.

10
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:49,565
Work my shift.
It's the perfect excuse.

11
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:53,458
I like my mother-in-law.
It's the wife I can't stand.

12
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:57,252
This wheel's stuck.

13
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:03,419
Oh, man.

14
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:06,263
Forty-five minutes there, Doc.

15
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:10,578
Please, murder is on the menu today,
so don't scold.

16
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:14,839
Guess what? She's dead.

17
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,938
Fresh gash to the arm.
Definitely post-mortem.

18
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,905
Right. Dead about 12 hours.

19
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:27,236
Blunt trauma to the head.
Anywhere from 12 to 15 years old.

20
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:29,368
- Track marks?
- None yet.

21
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,631
Could be hidden between
the toes or in her thighs.

22
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:33,089
You think that she's a pro?

23
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:35,079
Got called in
on a case like this last week.

24
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,220
Girl was in the trade
and still had braces on.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,877
I wouldn't be surprised
if some pimp was trying to send a message.

26
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:42,078
We're trying to hand this
off to Homicide.

27
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:44,464
14 open rape
cases are ahead of this one.

28
00:01:44,464 --> 00:01:49,052
Understood.
So give me a second.

29
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,093
Find anything?

30
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,328
Used condoms, syringes,
a couple of crack pipes.

31
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:56,517
We'll be sifting for a while.
But we got the murder weapon.

32
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,228
Couple of sales slips in her pocket,
and this charm bracelet.

33
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,528
- Any ID?
- Sorry.

34
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:03,557
Okay.
A receipt for bottled water...

35
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,288
and one for Hamptons Athletics,
size six, $159.95.

36
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:09,720
- Expensive shoes.
- Detectives.

37
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:12,789
Fluids are present.

38
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:15,900
Marked bruising to the thighs,
pelvic and vaginal areas.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,687
Handprint on the hip
and upper right buttock.

40
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:21,260
Spanked and raped.

41
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,211
Guess this one's ours.

42

2x09. Pixies

52
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:12,417
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/01/12

53
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:17,460
Couple of partials.
Handprint gives us a size,

54
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,477
but that's about it.
No latent, no ID.

55
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:22,356
Recent sex.
She's a non-consensual minor under 17,

56
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:24,144
so it's either statutory
or rape one.

57
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:27,102
Not to mention homicide.
Tenderloin kiddy pro?

58
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:29,103
Or she's right off the bus
from lowa.

59
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:32,771
Not with that haircut and the bracelet and
the expensive running shoes.

60
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:36,994
The only time I've ever seen a working girl
run is to pick up a trick or to get high.

61
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:40,159
- Any drugs in her system?
- Tox screen's not back yet.

62
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,579
- She could be an actress.
- She's flat. No implants.

63
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,037
Still good for the pedophile trade.

64
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:47,491
Name your price in illegal porn
and the market will bear it.

65
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,368
Let's concentrate
on the crime scene first.

66
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:52,589
The blood type on the brick matches
the victim so she wasn't a dump job.

67
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,660
Somebody saw or heard something.

68
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,551
We'll follow receipts and Forensics.

69
00:03:56,551 --> 00:04:00,516
- Good. Munch, Fin...
- Let me guess, door-to-door.

70
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,472
Clairvoyant.

71
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,769
Nobody is here. Let's go.
We got other floors.

72
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,682
I hear the TV.

73
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,651
Police!

74
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,684
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- I don't know anything.

75
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,715
I don't want trouble.

76
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:25,538
Nice view.
You like living here?

77
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:28,660
Used to. Now there's
cheap whores everywhere.

78
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,669
- You chase them, they come here.
- To paradise.

79
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,865
Nothing like the fecund scent
of dead animals.

80
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:35,562
I've been here 20 years.
I mind my own business.

81
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:38,898
- I stay another 20.
- An optimist.

82
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:44,652
My grandfather lived to be 105
on ouzo and silence.

83
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,518
A girl was murdered last night
outside your window.

84
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:49,594
- Another prostitute. Who cares?
- I do.

85
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:52,930
She was just a kid about her age.

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,813
You saw or heard it.
If you don't speak up...

87
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:04,136
- You would curse me?
- Every day.

88
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:12,005
Around 8:30, I heard shouting.

89
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:14,836
I wouldn't go to the window.

90
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,371
- I didn't want to see.
- Yeah, in case there was trouble.

91
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:21,043
- Can you describe the voices?
- I hear someone yell, "Whore!"

92
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:23,247
I turned up the TV.

93
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:26,178
Thanks for your help.

94
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:33,014
Talking Greek.
You're full of surprises.

95
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:36,613
If I don't keep some mystery,
you might grow bored and stop loving me.

96
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,286
- Hi, excuse me...
- I'll be with you in a minute, okay?

97
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:48,382
Tell me that these are worth $100.

98
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,548
That's cheap. Maureen's been
begging me for a pair, costs $150.

99
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:54,084
- All of her friends have them.
- Probably costs $3 to make.

100
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,972
That's including the 50 cents a day
they pay child laborers. Excuse me.

101
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:58,599
- You want to try those on?
- No thanks, though...

102
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,203
I'd like you to look
at this receipt, please.

103
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,229
Terrator running shoes. Hot item.

104
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,126
- You remember who made that purchase?
- You're kidding.

105
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:07,638
- Look around. This is a slow day.
- Yeah, you recognize this girl?

106
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:09,801
- Maybe a regular customer?
- She looks dead.

107
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,358
She is. Petite,
blue eyes, 5'1"...

108
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:15,029
Sorry. After a while,
they all start to look the same.

109
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,358
- I've got to get back.
- That's fine. Look.../ - Benson.

110
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:21,488
You remember anything
you just give us a call. / Okay.

111
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,717
ME finished cutting.

112
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,097
What've we got?

113
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,883
Jane Doe is a young female,
Tanner stage three.

114
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:32,625
That makes her about, 12-13?

115
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,205
Yeah, right about there.
Maybe a little older.

116
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,421
Cause of death?

117
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:39,190
Massive subdural hematoma
causing herniation of the brain.

118
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,018
Please tell me our perp's a secretor.

119
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:43,302
Definitely.
And he left plenty of semen to type.

120
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,806
What about the bruising?

121
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:46,627
Pelvic and pubic region.

122
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:49,859
Also several healed fractures
to the ribs, both wrists, fingers.

123
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:51,314
Long-term abuse?

124
00:06:51,314 --> 00:06:53,567
Too many injuries
for just plain clumsy.

125
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,161
Drugs? Alcohol?

126
00:06:55,161 --> 00:07:00,149
Nothing, except for diphenylmethane.
Ingredient found in laxatives.

127
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,113
Also has enamel erosion
on upper and lower incisors.

128
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:06,315
Self-induced vomiting.
She was bulimic.

129
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:10,614
She has very rough palms.
Blistered and healed over.

130
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:14,616
The kind you see on day laborers.
She worked for somebody.

131
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:18,581
What she was doing,
I won't hazard a guess.

132
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,308
Madam's name is Ruth Jay,
who goes by Mama Jay.

133
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:28,024
Specializes in pros
who pass as little girls.

134
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:32,961
Parochial school skirts, baby-doll dresses.
You get the picture.

135
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:36,885
- What are we doing here?
- Noon service.

136
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:44,081
Preacher's gonna start any minute.
I don't want to miss the choir.

137
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,241
We want to ask you a few
questions about your girls, Ruth...

138
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:49,081
then you can go inside
and praise the Lord. / Amen.

139
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:50,667
A whore in church?

140
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,163
If you studied the Bible,
you'd know that Mary Magdalene was a whore.

141
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:57,002
- She repented.
- So I'm a work in progress.

142
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:00,616
Don't judge me, or I'll
get to Heaven before you.

143
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:04,957
- What can I do for you, Detective?
- You know her?

144
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:09,595
No. Pretty young thing.
What a shame.

145
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,645
Just the kind of girl
your customers would like, right?

146
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:16,137
I don't deal in children.
My girls just look the part.

147
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:21,654
If she worked in the trade,
check with Willie Maxwell on Amsterdam.

148
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:27,246
He rents special videos under the counter.
Anybody knows her, he will.

149
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,504
I'll pray for you.

150
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:39,298
Can I help you
with something, Officers?

151
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:42,654
Yeah, have you seen this girl?
She's right up your alley.

152
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,377
You gonna make me smack you?

153
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:50,898
She looks familiar.
But, no, I can't say that I know her.

154
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:54,318
Come on, Willie. You and I both know
that you have customers with special needs.

155
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:58,158
- All we're looking for is an ID.
- I've never seen her.

156
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:01,525
Hey.

157
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,043
- What's this?
- He's returning that.

158
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,701
- Oh, yeah? I want to rent it.
- Not available.

159
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:08,281
What do you mean?
When I go to Blockbuster...

160
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,364
I can rent whatever walks in the door.
I want to rent this tape.

161
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:14,004
Okay, I know my rights.
You can't take that.

162
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:15,899
You don't have probable cause.

163
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,195
Anything you find without a search warrant
or probable cause...

164
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:21,786
is fruit from the poisonous tree.

165
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:25,512
My man, you want to
walk away from this?

166
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,599
- I'm not talking without my lawyer.
- No problem.

167
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,839
We want to make sure you understand
what you're being charged with.

168
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,256
It's a felony to possess kiddie porn,
magazines, videos, photographs.

169
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:39,870
We have a statement from your customer
saying that he rented that video from you.

170
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,734
- That was his tape.
- No, you already claimed possession.

171
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:46,820
You know something? We're not even
really interested in these charges.

172
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,888
- You're not?
- No.

173
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,526
We're not.

174
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:53,159
- Then what do you want?
- Who's the girl?

175
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:56,928
- What's in it for me?
- Now's not the time to play games.

176
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,291
Seems like a pretty good time to me.

177
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,127
You want something.
You think I've got it.

178
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:06,095
- Let's barter.
- Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

179
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,184
We're not going to house you
in general population...

180
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:10,251
and announce that a pedophile
is coming through.

181
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:13,013
We'll do that
if you ID the girl...

182
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,719
and give us a list of every private
video customer you have.

183
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,785
I don't know her.

184
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,988
She's not a starlet
in one of your productions?

185
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:32,191
You think I wouldn't remember
something that sweet?

186
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:41,545
- I need a shower.
- Not until you check this out.

187
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:44,234
We got a match
on your Jane Doe.

188
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:47,752
Carla Brice, age 13.
Height and weight all looks good.

189
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:51,135
- From Queens. What about Willie?
- We got him on possession.

190
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:55,099
We'll get his list of customers
and arrest every hump on it.

191
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,933
BRICE RESIDENCE
725 HILLSIDE AVENUE
QUEENS, NEW YORK
MONDAY, JANUARY 8

192
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:03,107
- How long has she been missing?
- Four days.

193
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:05,478
- Did you find her?
- We don't know.

194
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:09,150
That's why we're here.
We need to ask you some questions.

195
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:12,118
You must know something,
or you wouldn't have come.

196
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:15,917
Does your daughter wear jewelry?

197
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:19,679
A cross my mother gave her.

198
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:24,810
- And sometimes bracelets and a necklace.
- What kind of bracelets?

199
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:28,426
I don't know.
She traded with her friends.

200
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:31,915
Is she hurt?
Is my baby all right?

201
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:37,462
Did your daughter
participate in any sports? / Track.

202
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,762
Why are you asking me
these questions?

203
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:40,965
Tell me, what do you know?

204
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:45,904
Mrs. Brice,
did anybody hurt Carla?

205
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:51,860
It's all my fault.

206
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:57,727
We moved here to get
away from her father, but he found us.

207
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:04,157
She was trying to protect me,
and he hit her, and then she took off.

208
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,975
- Had this happened before?
- Yes.

209
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:11,001
But Carla always came home.

210
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:14,817
God, I'm so sorry.

211
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,167
I tried to get away from him.

212
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:27,412
Please take me to see her.

213
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:33,334
- We're ready.
- I can't.

214
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:34,766
It's okay.
We're right here.

215
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:37,168
We're going to stay with you, okay?

216
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:39,341
We're going to stay right here.

217
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:44,754
Hold on to me.
That's it. You set?

218
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,667
Oh, my God!

219
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:05,564
It's not her.
It's not my Carla.

220
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,022
All the details seemed right, Captain.

221
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:21,107
Everything matched up,
down to the broken bones.

222
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,093
Mistakes happen.
You did your job.

223
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,415
Yeah, sometimes this job stinks.

224
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:29,108
We had a uni take home Mrs. Brice.

225
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,118
Told her we'd keep an eye out
for Missing Persons.

226
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:34,007
Who's gonna keep an eye out
for Jane Doe? / I am.

227
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,551
Lab lifted off two sets of prints.

228
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:37,763
One the victim's, another partial.

229
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:40,827
Neither in the system.
By the way, those are real diamonds.

230
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,101
How do you know that?

231
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,684
One of my exes
had a taste for fine jewelry.

232
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:48,320
Five teddy bears studded with
diamonds. / Folks must have money.

233
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,331
- "All my love, Popi."
- I'd like to talk to him.

234
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,603
Maybe we can. Piece like that,
handcrafted, probably one of a kind.

235
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,193
I know a guy
in the jewelry district...

236
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:58,227
who could probably give us a read
on who made this stuff.

237
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:01,535
That's a start. Meanwhile, you two
get back to Missing Persons.

238
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:02,792
Cast a wider net.

239
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:07,013
Outer boroughs, out of state, outer space.
She's got to come from somewhere.

240
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,467
- Very cute.
- Cute?

241
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,005
Teddy bears are big this season.

242
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,468
That's interesting,
but not exactly helpful.

243
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:17,476
Custom piece, 18 karat...

244
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:21,662
diamonds, GVS quality, well cut.

245
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:25,302
Look at the pave work.
It's exceptional.

246
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:28,447
Anything that points to
a specific designer or craftsman?

247
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:32,172
- You see that initial on the bear's paw?
- If you say so.

248
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:37,024
Yeah, that 'W' stands for Wallerstein.
Emil Wallerstein. One of the best.

249
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:40,853
- Do you know where we can find him?
- He's semi-retired.

250
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:42,625
Only designs for one store.

251
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,257
His son-in-law's, Petrie's.
Corner of Park and 59th.

252
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:48,388
- Thanks a lot. See you again.
- Yeah.

253
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,110
MISSING PERSONS SQUAD
1 POLICE PLAZA
TUESDAY, JANUARY 9

254
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,367
We get 20 reports a day.
All go into the computer...

255
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,385
crosschecked against the DOA's brought
into the Medical Examiner.

256
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:56,515
We gave you the only match.

257
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:00,512
Let's fudge it a little with
the hair color, height and weight.

258
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:03,888
Depending on when she disappeared,
those stats might have changed.

259
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:06,907
- Here's one, 34, red hair.
- No. Next.

260
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,646
How about this?
Twenty-five... No, too tall.

261
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,013
Twenty-one-year-old,
butterfly tattoo on left buttock.

262
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:18,198
- No, no tats.
- Here's a new one.

263
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:21,659
Sixteen years old, brown hair,
blue eyes, 5' even, 92 lbs.

264
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,642
Reported missing by guardian,
an llya Korska.

265
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:27,910
Last seen leaving gymnastics practice.
Name is Kristy Meyerson.

266
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,607
- Explains the calluses.
- You got an address?

267
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:34,234
CHELSEA ATHLETIC CLUB
704 W. 23RD STREET
TUESDAY, JANUARY 9

268
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:40,258
Keep your legs together.

269
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:42,808
Watch your toes.

270
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,208
Squeeze your legs together.

271
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,853
Again!

272
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,105
You want to be champion,

273
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:50,855
you must accept
nothing less than perfection.

274
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:54,935
- My ankle...
- Pain is the price of glory.

275
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:58,006
Here. Now, you do it again.

276
00:15:58,006 --> 00:16:02,339
And this time, you spot the wall,
like I told you.

277
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,050
That's my girl. Now, go.

278
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,414
Amanda, Patsy, Lori,
take a lesson from Danielle.

279
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:15,042
- She has a heart of a champion.
- Ilya Korska?

280
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,793
Kind of hard on them, aren't you?

281
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:19,833
They don't know
what they're capable of until they try.

282
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,026
They know that I push them
because I love them.

283
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:24,624
- Who let you in here?
- Detective Stabler.

284
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:28,153
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.

285
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,973
- You found Kristy?
- Is there someplace we can go and talk?

286
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:34,814
Keep her working.

287
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:39,486
Who would do such a thing?

288
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:43,767
The Missing Persons report
lists you as her guardian.

289
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:47,382
Her parents placed her under my care
so that she could train here.

290
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,001
Nothing like this has ever happened.

291
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:53,969
- Where are her parents?
- In Oregon.

292
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:57,970
- They have money?
- Not really.

293
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,557
Father sells insurance,
mother is a secretary.

294
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:04,457
They sacrificed everything
so that Kristy could train with the best.

295
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,591
What about boyfriends?
Anyone named Popi?

296
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:10,537
My girls have no time for boyfriends.

297
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:11,978
They're teenagers.

298
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,933
They are elite athletes,

299
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,924
striving for an honor
that very few will attain.

300
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:19,245
To win a gold medal
requires absolute dedication.

301
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:23,620
- Kristy had that.
- When was the last time you saw her?

302
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:28,106
Day before last, after practice.

303
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:32,964
- Where'd she go after practice?
- I assume that she went home.

304
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:35,950
You're her guardian.
Didn't she stay with you?

305
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,366
No, she lived with a family
whose young daughter I also train.

306
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:42,809
Very good people.

307
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:46,036
We're going to need their address
and anyone else connected with the gym.

308
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:50,438
- Workers, coaches, athletes.
- Of course.

309
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,305
Anything I can do to help.

310
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:59,771
She could have been a champion.

311
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:05,740
I bet Kristy got those bruises
working out. / I'd call it abuse.

312
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,513
I'll get the car.

313
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:11,204
You looked pretty terrific
on those bars.

314
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:15,054
Yeah, right.
I'm the big dough girl.

315
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,782
What're you talking about?
You don't have an ounce of fat on you.

316
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:22,463
- Why'd I get my period?
- Because it's natural.

317
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:26,689
No, because I'm not training
hard enough.

318
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,922
PETRIE'S JEWELERS
5890 PARK AVENUE
TUESDAY, JANUARY 9

319
00:18:58,008 --> 00:19:00,622
Love your open-door policy.

320
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,588
- May I help you?
- Yes. This belong to you?

321
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:08,898
It's one of our custom pieces.
Exquisite, isn't it?

322
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,425
How much is it worth?

323
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:14,305
Without checking the computer,
I'd estimate around $8,000.

324
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:16,443
Would that computer be able
to tell us who bought that?

325
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:19,516
Of course. We keep meticulous
records on all our clients...

326
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:22,475
including past purchases,
birthdays, anniversaries.

327
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,732
Would you mind looking it up?

328
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:29,187
- I have customers waiting.
- Oh, yeah? Well, make them wait.

329
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:36,830
- Has anyone told her parents?
- Mr. Korska called them.

330
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,663
They're flying in from Oregon
as soon as they can book a flight.

331
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:42,706
Her mother calls every Wednesday
and Sunday, like clockwork.

332
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:46,446
- When did you last see Kristy?
- Day before yesterday.

333
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,715
She came home around dinnertime,
like always...

334
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:52,879
and changed into her running clothes
and headed out to run with Lori.

335
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:54,191
And who's Lori?

336
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:56,781
Another gymnast. They run
every night. Never miss.

337
00:19:56,781 --> 00:20:00,025
She's usually home
by 10:00, though...

338
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:03,429
and so when it got to be
midnight, I called llya.

339
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,860
I haven't slept since. / What's your
arrangement with Mr. Korska?

340
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,372
We board girls in his program.

341
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:12,755
They come from all over
to train with him.

342
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:17,668
And not all of the parents can
afford to move with them...

343
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:21,926
so llya places them with
families he knows and trusts.

344
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:23,630
And what do you get
for your trouble?

345
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,709
He trains our daughter
Hannah for free.

346
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:29,937
And gives us a small stipend
to help defray costs.

347
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,240
But we do it because
we love the girls and want to help.

348
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,171
Are there any other boys
or young men living here?

349
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:39,321
No. Kristy was our only boarder.

350
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:43,031
Who are you talking to?
What's wrong, Mommy?

351
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:46,143
Nothing, sweetheart,
this is...

352
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:49,530
Hi, I'm Olivia.
This is my friend Elliott.

353
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,447
- Hi.
- Hi.

354
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,270
- What's your name?
- Hannah.

355
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,948
- Hey, Hannah.
- She idolizes Kristy.

356
00:20:55,948 --> 00:21:00,279
What do you say Hannah shows me
Kristy's room? Let you two finish up.

357
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:03,982
Sweetheart, would you like to
show Olivia Kristy's room? / Okay.

358
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:09,377
Did Kristy ever
talk about her social life?

359
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:12,883
You know, boyfriends,
guys in the neighborhood?

360
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,991
Gymnastics was her life.

361
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:19,706
She dreamed of going to the Olympics.
It was all she ever talked about.

362
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:24,391
She ever mention someone named
Popi? / Not that I recall.

363
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:30,693
What can you tell me about her
relationship with Coach Korska?

364
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:36,422
She adored him,
feared him, respected him.

365
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:38,738
She was so grateful to be
accepted into his program...

366
00:21:38,738 --> 00:21:41,424
I think she would have done
anything for him.

367
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:46,840
I mean, sometimes I even
thought she tried too hard.

368
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,175
Kristy's really good.

369
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:51,149
She teaches me things, like
how to tuck when I somersault.

370
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:53,728
Do you know
when she's coming home?

371
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:56,073
You know what?

372
00:21:56,073 --> 00:22:00,227
Your mom is going to
talk to you about that later.

373
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:03,096
But first, maybe you can help me
do something to help her.

374
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:06,850
What? / I'm trying to find
Kristy's boyfriend.

375
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,785
- Did he ever come over?
- No.

376
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:13,333
No. Do you ever remember Kristy talking
about somebody named Popi?

377
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:16,149
You do? What did she say?

378
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:19,369
My mom says it's not nice
to spy on people.

379
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,085
I know, and your mom's right.

380
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:23,034
But you know what?
I'm just trying to help her.

381
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:26,482
So, it's okay.
You can tell me.

382
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:29,167
Sometimes Kristy
talked to him on the phone.

383
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:32,386
She said she'd meet him
after she went running.

384
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,890
Did you ever hear Kristy say
where Popi lives?

385
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,172
- No.
- No.

386
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:40,874
Do you remember hearing
Kristy say anything else?

387
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:44,432
- This is really important.
- One time she thanked him.

388
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:46,639
For what?

389
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:50,800
This teddy bear.
Kristy loves teddy bears.

390
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,778
Am I noticing a theme here?

391
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:57,404
Another gift from Popi,
who, by the way, is not her father.

392
00:22:57,404 --> 00:23:01,157
According to Hannah, Kristy used to
sneak out to meet him on her nightly runs.

393
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:03,574
I have the running mate's address.

394
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:04,943
I waited till 8:30,

395
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:07,013
but she never showed,
so I just ran without her.

396
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:10,194
- You two run together every night?
- Yeah, 8:00 sharp.

397
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:13,503
We meet at the pier and run along the
promenade to Battery Park City and back.

398
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,426
- That's a hell of a jog.
- We're in training.

399
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,760
We've got to drop the weight
or Korska will drop us.

400
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,179
He that tough?

401
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,002
He pulls out a tape measure and scale
for surprise inspections.

402
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:24,696
If you don't measure up, you're out.
It's the only way you can win.

403
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,750
- Tell us about Popi.
- Who?

404
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,882
Lori, come on. We know Kristy used these
nightly runs as an excuse to go see him.

405
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:35,069
I don't know
what you're talking about.

406
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,954
There's no reason
to cover for her anymore.

407
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:41,589
I'm not covering for anybody.

408
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,848
Kristy loved gymnastics.

409
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,088
She never met with any guy
when she was with me.

410
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:47,423
That's grounds for dismissal.

411
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:50,046
Can we talk later?
I'm late for my workout.

412
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:52,259
Sure. Wouldn't want to hold you up.

413
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:02,417
- What's the matter?
- What?

414
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:05,876
What, "what"?
You tell me what.

415
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:08,959
- I'm just...I'm not cutting it.
- Cutting what?

416
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:13,137
This college recruiter
came from Columbia today to talk to us.

417
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:16,491
- Yeah?
- And it's a really great school.

418
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:18,649
Okay.

419
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,266
What's the problem?

420
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:25,436
I got a B+ on my English midterm.

421
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,880
That's great.

422
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,282
I'm never going to get in
with grades like that.

423
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:36,791
Maureen, you're 15. Relax.

424
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,459
Nothing like a little healthy competition.

425
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:47,711
We found a stockpile of diuretics
and laxatives in Kristy's room.

426
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:50,989
What ever happened to just
hanging out on the jungle gym?

427
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,065
Went the way of your eight-track tape.
These girls are competing in a world...

428
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:56,820
where anything less than a perfect 10
is considered failure.

429
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,882
And llya Korska is the pied piper
to the promised land.

430
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:01,764
What's up with this guy, anyway?

431
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:06,773
Defected from Bulgaria in '88.

432
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:10,634
Coached 13 gold medallists
and scores of silvers and bronze.

433
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,736
Has a multi-million-dollar
endorsement contract...

434
00:25:12,736 --> 00:25:15,430
and he just he runs
a lucrative private coaching business.

435
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,376
Got no priors.
Running a check with Interpol.

436
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,050
Any luck on your end?

437
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:24,685
We traced the bracelet
to a guy named Kyle Hubert, 42.

438
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,716
A high-end real estate broker
on the Upper West Side.

439
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,843
Wait a minute.
I know that name.

440
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:34,691
Listed as a Gold Circle contributor to the
llya Korska Athletic Foundation.

441
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:37,225
Well, looks like
we found Popi.

442
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:46,494
One of our board members
called just before you arrived.

443
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:51,125
Are you certain that
it wasn't an accident? / It was murder.

444
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:54,460
You have a blank check from me
to help catch the animal that did this.

445
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,338
Thank you, that won't be necessary.
Is this Kristy?

446
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:02,004
Yes. She was amazingly gifted.

447
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:07,008
Lithe, fluid, graceful.

448
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:09,318
She could have taken
the gold at Nationals.

449
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,191
How long have you been
involved in girls' gymnastics?

450
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:16,522
As a donor, 10 years.
I try to help out wherever I can.

451
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:19,321
You've given quite a bit of money
to llya Korska's organization.

452
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,349
He's the best coach in the country.

453
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:23,189
We've also heard
that you've been quite generous.

454
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:27,078
Some of the girls received
scholarships and expensive gifts.

455
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:29,867
Those who show special
promise and talent.

456
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:32,052
You recognize this bracelet?

457
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,373
I bought it for Kristy. Why?

458
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:38,996
You always engrave your gifts,
"With all my love, Popi"?

459
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:41,089
It was her nickname for me.

460
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:44,423
She said that I reminded her
of her father.

461
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:47,583
- When did you give it to her?
- Tuesday.

462
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,917
The night she died.

463
00:26:50,261 --> 00:26:53,292
- You give it to her that night?
- No, in the morning.

464
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,423
Where were you Tuesday night?

465
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:58,212
- Here, working late.
- How late?

466
00:26:58,212 --> 00:27:02,021
- 10:00, 11:00.
- Can anyone verify that?

467
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,312
What are you insinuating?

468
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:08,394
- That you were sleeping with her.
- I was not.

469
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,658
Would you be willing to submit to
a blood test to confirm that?

470
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:13,246
- Absolutely not.
- Why not?

471
00:27:13,246 --> 00:27:16,745
I won't be subjected
to your witch-hunt tactics.

472
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:20,375
We only want the truth.

473
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:23,289
Talk to my lawyer.

474
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:26,447
We're gonna need a court order
to get that sample.

475
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,088
Why don't we hit Korska's place,

476
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:30,063
see what the girls have to say
about their benefactor.

477
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:32,964
Maybe someone saw him
with Kristy that night.

478
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,334
I've known him for 10 years.
He's a fine, upstanding gentleman.

479
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:40,185
We believe that he was having a
relationship with Kristy Meyerson.

480
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:42,720
Impossible. My girls
don't have relationships.

481
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,864
- He gave her a very expensive bracelet.
- As a reward for working hard.

482
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:50,032
Kyle Hubert is respected by the USOC...

483
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:53,032
and every athletic governing body
associated with gymnastics.

484
00:27:53,032 --> 00:27:56,481
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't be here.

485
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:58,651
Excuse me.

486
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:01,839
Girls! Come.

487
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,942
All right, let's go.
On the bar.

488
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:09,535
I don't feel I'm missing out on anything.
My dream is to go to the Olympics.

489
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:13,508
- Tell me about your coach.
- He's amazing. I'm so lucky to be here.

490
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:15,424
You don't mind all the yelling
and screaming?

491
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:19,359
No, it's worse if he ignores you.
That means he doesn't care anymore.

492
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:23,779
- What happened to your wrist?
- I was working on a new move.

493
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:26,300
A double-twisting double back.

494
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:30,785
It must've been wet. I slipped.
I gotta get back to my work now.

495
00:28:30,785 --> 00:28:33,284
Yeah, just one second.
I just have one more question.

496
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:37,871
Do you know a guy named Kyle Hubert?
You know him?

497
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:41,082
I hate how he's always staring at us.

498
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:42,950
He ever give you presents?

499
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,410
Sometimes. Like a new
outfit or a gym bag.

500
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,870
Or this one time he gave
me body lotion.

501
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,197
He told me to think of him
when I used it.

502
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:58,563
- So tell me about an average day.
- I'm up by 4:30...

503
00:28:58,563 --> 00:29:03,160
get here at 5:00, leave by 9:00
and then I have school till 1:30.

504
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,691
Sometimes llya gets the doctor
to write a note, and I don't have to go.

505
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:08,158
Lucky you.

506
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:12,029
Then after school, I have practice till 9:00
or 10:00 and I do my homework.

507
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:16,435
- So when do you eat?
- I only have breakfast and some fruit.

508
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,121
I gotta lose weight
if I'm gonna make the cut.

509
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:24,289
What can you tell me
about Kyle Hubert?

510
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:30,224
He hangs around a lot.
Watches us practice.

511
00:29:30,224 --> 00:29:32,594
He pays for my room and board.

512
00:29:32,594 --> 00:29:35,310
And there's this one thing
he does that makes me so mad.

513
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,838
- What's that?
- He calls me Olive Oyl.

514
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:45,767
I scored 38 in my last five comps.

515
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,442
I'm not bragging, but I've got a new
dismount that's better than anyone else's.

516
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:52,934
Why didn't you tell us
about Kristy's boyfriend?

517
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:56,863
- What boyfriend?
- Kyle Hubert.

518
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:59,907
- Kyle Hubert?
- Yeah.

519
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:02,965
She'd meet with him after you two ran.
You never knew about that?

520
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:08,041
Why would she tell me?
If I'd known, I'd have to tell Coach. Rules.

521
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:12,341
- It all makes sense, though.
- Yeah? What does?

522
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,580
Mr. Hubert was always
giving her the best presents.

523
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,622
Bracelets, clothes,
stuffed animals.

524
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:22,490
I guess she liked
all the attention.

525
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:28,941
- Wouldn't you?
- He creeps me out.

526
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,476
- Alibi?
- He says he worked late.

527
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:36,720
- Nobody was there to confirm or deny.
- What about the bracelet?

528
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,886
He gives all the girls gifts.

529
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:41,493
Apparently he gives himself only to Kristy.
At least no one else is talking.

530
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:43,986
But his financials made a statement.

531
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:47,573
Daddy Rich Bucks has a little love nest.
TRW came back with two mortgages.

532
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:51,588
One for a pad uptown. The other, a couple
of blocks from the slaughterhouse.

533
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:58,013
- They were here.
- What time?

534
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:00,344
- Around 8:00.
- You sure about that?

535
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:03,013
She ran out the building crying.
He ran after her.

536
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:07,263
- Did you hear anything else?
- He said he'd never let her go.

537
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:09,410
Told me the girl was his daughter.

538
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:14,697
- Got it.
- Let's go.

539
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,329
That son of a bitch.

540
00:31:25,935 --> 00:31:28,414
Welcome to Fantasyland.

541
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:31,240
Perfect for a fairy princess.

542
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,650
He's no prince.

543
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:43,099
A little girl's dream
turned into a nightmare.

544
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:52,144
- Kyle liked to party.
- And savor the memories.

545
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,861
Looks like Daddy forgot
to change the sheets.

546
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:04,671
The semen-stained sheets gave us enough
DNA to match the semen from the body.

547
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:07,270
Not to mention the letters,
pictures and videotapes.

548
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,489
And an apartment manager who puts you
with Kristy the night of the murder.

549
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:12,583
Why would I kill her?
I worshipped her.

550
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,843
Is that why she went running from your
apartment in tears the night she died?

551
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:17,431
She had ended it with you, hadn't she?

552
00:32:17,431 --> 00:32:18,595
You couldn't take the rejection.

553
00:32:18,595 --> 00:32:20,259
- Or risk the exposure.
- What?

554
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:22,960
- You raped and murdered her.
- I did not.

555
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,758
Twelve hours of videotape
and matched semen say you did.

556
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:30,183
- It was consensual.
- She was 16.

557
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:33,405
It's called statutory rape.
Consensual or not, you're going to jail.

558
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,383
The only question is for how long.

559
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,055
Is that what this is all about?

560
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:48,536
That sense of humor is going to serve
you well with your bunkmates up in Attica.

561
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:52,706
I could have saved you
both a lot of work.

562
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:58,244
We kept our relationship private,
to protect the program.

563
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:04,476
Kristy was not a child.
She was 19 years old.

564
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:15,646
Hubert's not lying. She was 19.
We got a copy of her birth certificate.

565
00:33:15,646 --> 00:33:18,113
In other words,
you've got no case.

566
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:23,893
It's amazing.
She only looks 14.

567
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:26,773
It's sick,
but it's not illegal.

568
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:28,755
Then why did Kristy
lie about her age?

569
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:30,535
By the time she was
good enough for Korska...

570
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:33,624
she was older than most girls,
so she shaved off a few years.

571
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:36,160
She did a damn good job
of covering her tracks.

572
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,583
Korska claims he didn't know.

573
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,544
- How did Hubert?
- He follows all the local events.

574
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:44,079
He notices Kristy's been
around longer than she claims.

575
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,799
He preyed on her vulnerability.

576
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,619
These girls sacrifice
their childhoods to win.

577
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:50,638
- They're starved for love.
- Not to mention food.

578
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:53,795
They stopped eating
to maintain their perfect weight.

579
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:55,267
That stops their menstrual cycle.

580
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,243
No cycle, no estrogen.
No estrogen, no growth.

581
00:33:58,243 --> 00:34:00,681
Physically,
emotionally and sexually.

582
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,988
Leaves guys like Hubert
just licking their chops.

583
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:05,701
Yeah, but it's not a motive
for killing her.

584
00:34:06,497 --> 00:34:08,771
What about Korska?

585
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:11,909
Look, the kids aren't the only ones
performing for the judges.

586
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,734
Prints off the bracelet came back.

587
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,191
One is Kristy's.
The other isn't Hubert's.

588
00:34:16,191 --> 00:34:19,517
Check lmmigration.
They'll have prints on Korska.

589
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,905
This guy may be
up to more than we think.

590
00:34:21,905 --> 00:34:26,090
Captain, Mom and Dad are here.

591
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:34,227
- She was so pretty.
- An angel.

592
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:38,306
Do you have any idea who
might have hurt your daughter?

593
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:43,857
- No. Everyone loved her.
- No, everyone loved to watch her.

594
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:47,504
We put our life savings
into her training.

595
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:51,125
Traveled to competitions,
moved from coach to coach.

596
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,658
She was so close to her dream.

597
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:58,162
- Why did Kristy lie about her age?
- She didn't lie.

598
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:04,161
She just didn't discuss it. Korska
doesn't like to work with older girls.

599
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:07,058
She was a young woman.
Did she ever date?

600
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:09,175
Kristy was a virgin.

601
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:17,034
- She was seeing someone.
- What are you talking about?

602
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:20,605
- She never told me.
- She knew you'd never understand.

603
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:25,939
- I am her mother. I did it all for her.
- You did it for yourself.

604
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:37,365
- What else did Kristy tell you?
- That she was in love with him.

605
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:42,058
And desperately afraid Korska would dump
her from the program if he found out.

606
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,513
Coach kept a tight rein on his girls.

607
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:52,166
And a tight grip on Kristy's wrist.

608
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,802
His prints were on the bracelet.

609
00:35:57,141 --> 00:36:00,734
Arms straight.
Keep your arms straight. / Lori.

610
00:36:00,734 --> 00:36:03,188
- Lori.
- Can't talk now.

611
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:05,735
- We're looking for your coach.
- He went to dinner.

612
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,960
Hey, what's wrong?

613
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,541
I swore not to tell.

614
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:17,236
Lori, I don't know what the problem is,
but honestly, we just want to help.

615
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:22,167
Coach couldn't trust Kristy,
so he had me watch her for him.

616
00:36:22,635 --> 00:36:25,945
You spied on Kristy?

617
00:36:25,945 --> 00:36:31,205
Kyle was sleeping with her.
He gave her clothes and a charm bracelet.

618
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:34,640
Why didn't you tell us that before?

619
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,904
Coach promised me a spot on the team
if I told him and kept my mouth shut.

620
00:36:40,904 --> 00:36:45,574
Today, he called me fat so
and said I might not make trials.

621
00:36:45,574 --> 00:36:48,037
When did you tell him?

622
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:52,911
- The day Kristy died.
- What did Korska do?

623
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,957
He ran off to find her.

624
00:36:54,957 --> 00:36:57,811
Leave her alone.
She needs to practice.

625
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:03,078
We're done with Lori,
but we've got some questions for you.

626
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:06,198
Girls are always coming to me
with their petty complaints.

627
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:08,117
Lori said that you
told her to watch Kristy.

628
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:11,224
Stupid kid was throwing it away.
For what? Clothes? Trinkets?

629
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:14,061
- Love?
- Love has no place in my gym.

630
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:16,812
Where did you go after Lori
told you about Kyle?

631
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:18,980
I followed her
to the dirty cockroach's apartment.

632
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,816
And then? / And then I left.
What could I do?

633
00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:25,279
No, you didn't.
You waited for her.

634
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:29,151
Kyle Hubert gave her a bracelet
that night. Your prints were on it.

635
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:34,573
All right. I grabbed her wrist
when she came out.

636
00:37:34,573 --> 00:37:37,608
Her hair was messed up.
She smelled like sex.

637
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:41,542
I told her to break it off
with that scum or you're through.

638
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,002
Then she went back inside.

639
00:37:43,002 --> 00:37:48,140
Then she came running back out
crying after she'd broken it off with him.

640
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,504
She begged me for forgiveness.
She wanted a second chance.

641
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:54,006
So I took the little whore
down the street for a run.

642
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:57,804
The girl was hysterical,
and you made her go running?

643
00:37:57,804 --> 00:38:00,474
I'm not paid to teach weakness.

644
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:04,114
- What time did you drop her off?
- 8:15.

645
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:10,453
Korska claims he picked up Kristy
at Hubert's apartment...

646
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,641
and dropped her off
to run at 8:15.

647
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:16,314
- Assuming Korska's telling the truth.
- Which he may not be, since Lori says...

648
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,639
that she didn't run with Kristy
the night of Kristy's murder.

649
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:21,774
Old lady Pappas says she heard
someone yell "whore" an hour later.

650
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:24,872
Right outside,
Kristy's body was found.

651
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:27,066
Something made her veer off
that promenade.

652
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,554
So if we can figure out
what happened to her from here...

653
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,449
to where she
veered off the promenade...

654
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:34,340
we'll know how her body got
behind that dumpster.

655
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,223
Sounds like mere speculation
masquerading as fact.

656
00:38:37,223 --> 00:38:39,044
Your theory cries for an eyewitness.

657
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:42,659
And something tells me you have one,
or you wouldn't be acting so smug.

658
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:44,642
Am I that transparent?

659
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,572
"V" is for your
friendly neighborhood vendor.

660
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:49,884
I went to the promenade this morning.
I spoke to a couple of joggers.

661
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:54,316
They said this guy sets up his cart
around noon and stays till late.

662
00:38:54,316 --> 00:38:57,475
What do you say we go pay
Munch's hunch a visit?

663
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:03,036
Yeah, I seen her.
She's the one that got herself killed.

664
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:06,795
She used to come by running here
every night with that cute redhead.

665
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:09,801
- I tell you, I could set my watch by her.
- Can you ID the redhead?

666
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:12,917
Yeah. Sweet little thing.

667
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:17,022
Yeah. She used to always get a water
for herself and her friend.

668
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:23,081
She still run by here? / Every night.
I'll tell you, it worries me.

669
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:26,105
I always thought they were
too young to be out at night.

670
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,261
Do you remember the last time
you saw them running together?

671
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:31,859
Last Monday.
On account of I'm off on Tuesdays.

672
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:36,078
- Same night Kristy was killed.
- You're sure they were together Monday?

673
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:39,302
Positive. They stopped by
for their usual water.

674
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:42,464
Though, come to think of it,
they took off in another direction.

675
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,955
- Which way?
- Down that street.

676
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,903
Usually they stay on the jogging path.

677
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:49,890
But I think maybe they
were trying a new route.

678
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,078
MEAT PACKING DISTRICT
FRIDAY, JANUARY 12

679
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,848
8:30 exactly.
Just like clockwork.

680
00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:03,386
- Lori, can I talk to you for a second?
- I got to finish my run.

681
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:06,081
- This won't take long.
- You're in my way.

682
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:08,696
Kind of like Kristy
was in your way?

683
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:15,896
How long am I gonna be here?
I've got to go train.

684
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,574
Coach is gonna cut me
if I don't make weight.

685
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:19,617
Just a few more questions.

686
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:24,545
Okay, you said that
Kyle Hubert gave Kristy a charm bracelet?

687
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,913
Right? / Yeah, he gave her
a lot of nice things.

688
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:29,857
Lori, how did you
know about the bracelet...

689
00:40:29,857 --> 00:40:32,912
when you didn't see Kristy
the night she died?

690
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:39,431
You want me to be sorry she's dead.

691
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:42,893
I'm not.

692
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:46,596
I didn't have some
rich boyfriend, okay?

693
00:40:46,596 --> 00:40:50,980
I didn't have some pretty little face.
Nobody ever cared about me.

694
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,952
So Kristy got all the attention.

695
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,811
She got everything so easy.

696
00:40:57,966 --> 00:41:00,847
I do it all on my own.

697
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:03,852
My parents don't love me.

698
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:07,601
The only one who does
is Coach, and...

699
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:13,011
- he lied to me.
- How'd he lie to you?

700
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:17,330
He promised me I could
have her spot if I told him.

701
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:22,080
Kristy was waiting for me.

702
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:28,901
She had broken up with Kyle,
and Coach said he'd keep her on the team.

703
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:33,867
That left no place for me.

704
00:41:34,495 --> 00:41:38,536
And you couldn't let her
take that away from you, could you, Lori?

705
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:46,529
We started to argue.

706
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:52,328
She got everything so easy.

707
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:57,573
She started to run away,
so I followed her.

708
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:08,556
The brick just flew out of my hand.
I didn't mean for it to hit her.

709
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:16,322
She made me do it.

710
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,524
Alignment! Tummies in.

711
00:42:31,524 --> 00:42:33,152
Coming to stir up more trouble?

712
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:35,163
Lori confessed to killing Kristy.

713
00:42:35,163 --> 00:42:38,907
Lori's an imbecile.
Strong arms.

714
00:42:38,907 --> 00:42:41,139
Again.

715
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:45,542
- She wants to see you.
- Soon. After Nationals.

716
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:50,374
Very nice, my little pumpkins,
very nice. Up again.

717
00:42:50,374 --> 00:42:53,717
Show Korska what you can do.

718
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:59,367
Legs together.
Tummy in. Good.

719
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,115
That's my girls.
