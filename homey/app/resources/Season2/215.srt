1
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,189
In the criminal justice system,

2
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,833
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,435
In New York City,

4
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,681
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

5
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,752
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:39,329
These are their stories.

7
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,381
You had to take a shortcut.

8
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,683
I wouldn't have had to 
if you would just once...

9
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,519
get out of the house on time.

10
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,686
What's the big hurry?

11
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,289
One of your girlfriends 
supposed to be there?

12
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,513
God, I hope so.

13
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,429
Something just fall out of there?

14
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,230
I didn't see.

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,660
Well, tell him his doors came open.

16
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:13,973
Excuse me,
your doors are open!

17
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,342
Hello?

18
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,313
What was that about?

19
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,582
All I know is,
it's clear. Go.

20
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,684
Well, did something fall 
out of there or not?

21
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,817
Just go.

22
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,514
Oh, Stop.

23
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,663
Name's Sophie Douglas, eight.
Guy cuffed her to this bar inside.

24
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,665
She managed to wriggle
her hand out to escape.

25
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,233
- When'd she go missing?
- Three days ago.

26
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,861
We were working on it 
as a custodial snatch.

27
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,937
Mother was convinced it was her ex.

28
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,539
No ransom.
Been a custody battle.

29
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,074
The father,
we couldn't find him.

30
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,876
But it was a complete stranger.

31
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,146
I see what you're thinking.
We screwed up, right?

32
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,182
We're not thinking anything.

33
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,650
Mother's in the waiting room.

34
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,053
Doc's doing the rape kit now.

35
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,459
Sophie, I'm going to use 
the cotton swab now.

36
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,093
Just on the legs, okay?

37
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,893
How's she doing?

38
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,734
Fluids on the inner thigh.

39
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,443
Excuse me.

40
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,814
All right, Sophie,
we're going to take some pictures now.

41
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,250
- Hi, Sophie.
- Hi.

42
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,714
My name is Olivia.
How are you doing?

43
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,756
I'm okay.

44
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,893
I gotta fill up this whole room with bubbles.

45
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,196
I was wondering if you could help me
'cause it's a pretty big room.

46
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,598
A tear at the posterior fourchette.

47
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,835
Complete transection of the hymen at 5:00.

48
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,205
Entire introitus swollen and red.

49
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,372
He raped her.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/02/23

63
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,463
We got a stranger-child abduction
with a confirmed rape.

64
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,741
Name is Sophie Douglas, eight.

65
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:53,733
Grabbed four days ago,
escaped last night.

66
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,835
Tox screen came back 
positive for tranquilizers.

67
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,970
Well, where are we on it?

68
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,800
We know the guy owns a white van.
That's it.

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,907
- No make, no model.
- No witnesses?

70
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,909
Two of them sat behind the van 
for 20 minutes.

71
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,777
Couldn't give us one number on the plate.

72
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,513
Put out the word to other houses.
Start running known pedophiles...

73
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,582
through DMV for van owners.

74
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,783
We're on it.

75
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,385
Benson, Stabler,
interview the girl.

76
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,989
Captain, the mother thinks she's
too traumatized to do it today.

77
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,925
Well, tell Mrs. Douglas we don't
mean to be insensitive...

78
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:23,254
but if we're going to catch this guy,
every second counts.

79
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,699
Child Advocates Center of Manhattan
552 E.81St Street, Monday, February 19

80
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,802
What's everybody still doing here?
I thought I was late.

81
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,960
We're having difficulty
separating mother and daughter.

82
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,243
Sophie won't be able to talk 
freely in front of her.

83
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,713
- Did you explain that?
- Yep.

84
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:44,684
All right.
Have her come into the viewing with us.

85
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,786
Sophie,
that's such a pretty name.

86
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,977
Now, Sophie, do you know why you're here?

87
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,159
Because of the man.

88
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:58,364
Yeah. I'm going to ask you some
questions about the man, if that's okay.

89
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,465
Okay.

90
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,828
Okay. The man's skin,
what color was it?

91
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,406
- Like ours.
- Like ours.

92
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,542
And his hair?
What color was his hair?

93
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,980
Was it sort of dark like mine,
or was it lighter like yours?

94
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,341
I can't remember.

95
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,785
He had scary teeth.

96
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,254
Scary?
What was scary about them?

97
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,057
They looked like a monster's.

98
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:28,361
So tell me,
how did you meet this man?

99
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:32,360
My mom says I'm supposed to
go straight home, but...

100
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,201
I saw a puppy.

101
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,738
- Did the man have this puppy?
- No.

102
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,540
I didn't want to get in the van.

103
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,177
We know that, Sophie, honey.
It's okay. We know that.

104
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,612
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

105
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,448
Did you hear what she said?

106
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,451
- It's okay, Sophie.

108
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,456
How long are you planning
to put her through this?

109
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,924
We don't want to rush her.

110
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,728
Then let me bring her back in a couple
of days when she's more up to it.

111
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:06,532
Olivia, we're in a bit of a time crunch here.
We need the location now.

112
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,632
Sophie, let's talk about the van.

113
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:14,602
When you were inside,
could you see any of the street signs?

114
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,976
No.

115
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,509
Did the man say anything to you in the van?

116
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,383
He didn't talk until the room.

117
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,718
The room?

118
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,579
He said it was my Party Day.

119
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,853
There were lots of balloons and stuff...

120
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,461
but it wasn't a real party.

121
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,389
Why not?

122
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,594
Because nobody else was there.

123
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,560
Sophie, what happened at the party?

124
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,402
I had cupcakes and punch...

125
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,580
but then I fell asleep.

126
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,884
And when I woke up,
he was staring at me...

127
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,554
and he said it was time to get ready.

128
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,983
Get ready for what?

129
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,293
Picture Day.

130
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,563
I had to wear lots of costumes.

131
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,128
What kind of costumes?

132
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,170
A fairy princess...

133
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,872
and a mermaid...

134
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,005
and a ballerina.

135
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,280
So he took pictures all day?

136
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,016
I told him I can dress myself,

137
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,885
but he said he had to help me anyway.

138
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,687
I started crying.

139
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,822
I'm going in there.

140
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,057
Benson knows what she's doing.
Sophie's in good hands.

141
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,192
She needs me.

142
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,727
She needs to focus.
She won't be able to if you go in.

143
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,629
Look, I'm not letting her relive this again.

144
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,663
Mrs. Douglas, do you want to catch
the man who is responsible for this?

145
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,968
I want him dead.

146
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,442
Then you've got to help us.

147
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,769
Get to day three.

148
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:03,549
Sophie, you said that there was
a Party Day and a Picture Day.

149
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,774
Did he have a name for the next day?

150
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,079
My Special Day.

151
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,760
And what happened then?

152
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,020
He said I had to be very clean.

153
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,435
So I had to take a bubble bath.

154
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,936
It's all my fault.

155
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,239
No, Sophie,
this is not your fault.

156
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,108
He said he had more puppies in his van.

157
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,511
I just wanted to see them.

158
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,678
I love puppies.

159
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,114
It's okay, Sophie,
I understand. I love puppies, too.

160
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:39,218
There was a big box
way in the back of the van.

161
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,079
I climbed in it to see them, but...

162
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,824
Please don't tell my mom.

163
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,393
Sophie, Sophie.
listen to me.

164
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,595
Your mom is not mad at you,
nobody is.

165
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,198
Everybody knows that this man tricked you.

166
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,166
- I broke the rule.
- No.

167
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,168
All I wanted to do was see the puppies.

168
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,405
Honey, that's okay.
I understand.

169
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,005
- Mommy.
- Sophie.

170
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,644
It's okay, honey,
it's okay.

171
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,912
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,670
It's okay.

173
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,283
Mrs. Douglas.

174
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,619
No. No more.
This is enough.

175
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,378
I am taking her home now.

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,330
Well, you know, she's not
bringing her back anytime soon.

177
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,431
If at all.

178
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,701
Well, if she continues to be uncooperative,
we still have legal recourse.

179
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,737
Puts her in the room.
It doesn't pull the words out of her.

180
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:36,075
I wouldn't put my girls through it.
You don't know.

181
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,377
Well, after all that,
we don't have much to go on.

182
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:42,081
Then we re-canvass.
Let's just start where he abducted her.

183
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:46,308
Maybe Munch and Fin are
having better luck with the van.

184
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,323
Oliver Tunney, a.k.a. Jolly Ollie,
a.k.a. Squiggles the Clown.

185
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,958
I don't see fortune cookies.

186
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,094
Molested the kids 
he was paid to entertain.

187
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,795
Owns a white van.

188
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,364
How many times you gonna read that?
Where the fortune cookies at?

189
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,433
They're always stale.
Told 'em to forget it.

190
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,397
- What?
- There's our clown now.

191
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,267
What's shaking there, Bozo?

192
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,845
Who are you?

193
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,747
Detective Tutuola and Munch.

194
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,115
You been keeping your nose clean?

195
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,583
The red rubber one?

196
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,119
- That's not funny.
- Where you been all day?

197
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,321
In Connecticut, painting a house.

198
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,724
I got my own business.
It's legit.

199
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,927
- House painting?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,396
Unmarked white van.
You mind if I take a look inside?

201
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,231
Matter of fact, I do.

202
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,166
Been up to your old tricks there, Ollie?

203
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,106
No. I learned my lesson.

204
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,205
Sing Sing taught me impulse control.

205
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,240
Well, how do you explain this clown paint?

206
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,276
It's house paint.
I just told you, I paint houses.

207
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,745
It must have got on me.

208
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,418
Looks like probable cause to me.

209
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:49,882
Mr. Tunney, I'm going to 
have to ask you...

210
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,117
to step away from the van.

211
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,183
Come on, guys.
Give me a break.

212
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,019
You violated your parole.
You're coming with us.

213
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,228
We found balloons in your van.

214
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,529
After a little dusting...

215
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,364
we'll find the girl's fingerprints, too.

216
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,633
She's ready and willing to
pick you out of a lineup.

217
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,202
Tell us what happened.
We can help you. Make things easier.

218
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,439
I didn't give no girl a party.

219
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,608
Then why aren't you giving us an alibi?

220
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,278
Surely somebody saw you this weekend.

221
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,482
Found this going through
your belongings, Tunney. Interesting.

222
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,886
Only the children's events are circled.

223
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,154
That doesn't mean anything.

224
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,755
Yeah, so we made some calls.

225
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:34,860
See, witnesses said they saw
you at the county fair in Norwalk.

226
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,364
See? I told you I didn't do it.

227
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,598
I'm innocent.

228
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,100
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll be...

229
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,668
Not so fast there,
Chuckles.

230
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,938
Those same witnesses filed complaints
about the touchy-feely games...

231
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,206
that you play with those kids.

232
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,603
Connecticut authorities would
like to have a word with you.

233
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,349
How did the re-canvassing go?

234
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,719
Broad daylight,
nobody saw nothing.

235
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,554
Mrs. Douglas returned your call.

236
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,422
Says she wants Sophie
to have more healing time

237
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,092
before you talk to her again.

238
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,311
Okay. Hey, you guys,
it's going on 8:00.

239
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,197
We're fresh out of leads.

240
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,297
What do you say we call it a day?

241
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,869
I've still got time to go to the toy store.

242
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,537
Kathy's gonna faint when she finds out...

243
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,441
I got the twins' birthday present 
two days early.

244
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,133
Hey, it's me.
We still on for dinner?

245
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:30,549
I think so. Okay.
See you then.

246
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,251
How's Mr. Perfect?

247
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,587
He's good. Of course,
I've only met him once...

248
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,056
and the only time I talk to him is
when I'm calling to cancel.

249
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,457
But other than that, great.

250
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,192
You got any plans tonight,
Munch?

251
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,660
No. But the night is young...

252
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,658
and the world is full of 
endless possibilities.

253
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,367
Everybody stays.

254
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,802
Why?

255
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:53,266
Man in a white van grabbed another girl.

256
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,085
- All he got was beer?
- So says the owner.

257
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,020
Yeah, a six-pack,
the one on special.

258
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,122
How long after you left 
did Mrs. Guzek arrive?

259
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,357
No customers between.

260
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,959
I want you to tell me everything
you remember about him.

261
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,562
American. 6 feet. Drunk.

262
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,231
Eye color?
Hair color?

263
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,333
Any distinguishing characteristics?

264
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,136
The teeth. 
The teeth were very unfortunate.

265
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,437
Unfortunate?

266
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,332
Like Austin Powers.

267
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,943
They pull that tape yet?

268
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,612
That was broken when I bought it.
But I figured it was...

269
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,481
- better than nothing.
- Yeah, that's brilliant.

270
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,788
No chance this guy salvaged
my crapfest of a day

271
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:39,485
by using a credit card, is there?

272
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,121
No. It was the last $20 I got.

273
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,754
I remember distinctly,

274
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:47,459
because he asked me for
$2 of his change in quarters.

275
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,762
Harry, write him a receipt for
the top $20 in that drawer.

276
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,463
See if the lab can lift a print off it.

277
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,332
You got it.

278
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,701
So I had one foot out the door
when I heard a bottle smash.

279
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,769
What'd you see?

280
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,424
The back door of the van slamming
shut and peeling

281
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:00,840
out a few seconds later...
from this spot right here.

282
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,541
And this would be 
the bottle smash you heard?

283
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,445
Yeah, there was a bag with the rest 
of the six-pack right beside it.

284
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,813
You see the driver of the car?

285
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,914
No.

286
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,526
But I might have caught 
a piece of the license plate.

287
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,451
It started with "H."

288
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,421
Or it might've been "B." I'm not sure.
Look, is it okay if I go?

289
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,956
The cold's really not good for her.

290
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,958
Yeah. Thank you.

291
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,826
Our guy asked for quarters inside.

292
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,329
I don't see any arcades or 
Laundromats around here.

293
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,264
Maybe he needed to make some calls.

294
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:29,268
He sees Mrs. Guzek go in the store.
Kirsten's alone in the car.

295
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,504
Nobody's around.
Can't see the car from inside.

296
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,541
He grabs the girl,
takes her to the back door of the van.

297
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,043
Drops the beer right here 
during the struggle.

298
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,379
Closes the door behind him.
Cuffs her to the bar.

299
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,182
Jumps in the front and takes off.

300
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,285
I'm pulling LUDs on this phone.

301
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,720
Harry.

302
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,821
Yeah.

303
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,422
Dust this baby off.

304
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,440
I know it's a long shot,

305
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,959
but pop that box and dust
the quarters, too, all right?

306
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,286
No problem. Joe.

307
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,266
Apartment Of Charles And Jeanne Guzek
317 W.93Rd Street, Monday, February 19
10:42:19 PM

308
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,903
The car was parked right out front.

309
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,505
I was only in the market for a minute.

310
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,948
They were almost home.

311
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:12,511
I called on the cell 
to pick up cigarettes for me.

312
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:16,715
It was so cold out,
so I let Kirsten wait in the car.

313
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,117
How could I do that?

314
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:23,122
Mrs. Guzek, did you see anyone
around the white van when you went in?

315
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,690
No.

316
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,223
Can you get us Kirsten's most recent photo?

317
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,467
It's way past her bedtime.

318
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,037
Please, God,
don't let him hurt my baby.

319
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,507
Mrs. Guzek, we're going to do
everything that we can.

320
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,208
We want you to try to remember.

321
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,645
Did you see anything
when you came out of the store?

322
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,148
Just the open car door.

323
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:53,786
It was like a live wire hit me.
I kept screaming her name.

324
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,821
But I knew.

325
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,891
It's from our last vacation.

326
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,684
She just turned eight.

327
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,502
We're positive it's the same guy?

328
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,771
Unless there's a white-van-driving,
dentally-challenged...

329
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,907
pedophile convention in town, 
I'd say yes.

330
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,509
Well, why would this guy risk
another grab so soon?

331
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,180
Store owner said he was intoxed.
People tend to drink when they got worries.

332
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,416
Guy had to be worried somebody
could ID him from Sophie.

333
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,251
When nobody comes for him 
by the next day...

334
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,154
he figures nobody caught his tags,
he's safe. He ventures back out.

335
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,889
We got two different approaches.

336
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,492
Sophie was organized.
He used the puppy con.

337
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,095
Kirsten, it was an impulse grab.
Blitz attack.

338
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,664
Our guy's flexible.
No way he's a first-timer.

339
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,400
We were supposed to have the city-wide
open cases for the past five.

340
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,936
Where the hell are they?

341
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,871
You know,
it's 1:30 in the morning.

342
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,606
If he's following the same schedule...

343
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,641
she had Party Day when he got her home.

344
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,410
Picture Day's in about eight hours.

345
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,512
I got a little more description 
from the store owner.

346
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,080
I'm gonna run it through the PIMs machine.

347
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,538
I guess I could run partial plates on vans.

348
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:59,084
Look for an "H" in a haystack.

349
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,250
- Or a "B."
- Or a "B."

350
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,092
It's after 3:00. Any luck?

351
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,395
Got a lot of bad-mouthed mothers here.

352
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,898
Bucktooth, snaggletooth,
mangled tooth, missing tooth.

353
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,434
I thought you got a little more 
on the pedigree.

354
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,237
Just the approximate height.
That really narrowed it down.

355
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,963
Yeah. Well,
keep doing what you're doing.

356
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,680
How goes it, Elliot?

357
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,984
Hey, I made that.
19 hours ago, mind you...

358
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,919
but still, a little tact.

359
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,455
Hey, Munch, why do you do this?
You always do this.

360
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,724
He puts the lid back on an empty can.

361
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,526
- It's just my way.
- I'm getting coffee.

362
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,128
- Double espresso.
- No-foam 2% latte.

363
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,531
Pastrami on rye?

364
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,935
Files ordered by Det. Benson.
Where do you want them?

365
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,438
Captain,
we need an incident room.

366
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,731
Liv.

367
00:17:58,731 --> 00:17:59,578
What time is it?

368
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,146
- 3:10.
- Oh, no.

369
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,553
Yeah, I know. I know 
you didn't get your full 30,

370
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:06,408
but the files just got here.

371
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,920
I have read the same paragraph five times,

372
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,894
and I still have no idea what it says.

373
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,031
8:00 a.m. If I remember my
elementary school mathematics...

374
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,667
we've been working 24 straight hours.

375
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,403
He's had Kirsten for 12.

376
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,171
- Can I have some of that?
- No.

377
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,239
- Please.
- No.

378
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,340
Come on.

379
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,409
Can't share eye drops.
That's how you get pinkeye.

380
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,277
Just give him the eye drops.
You know something?

381
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,912
We're just spinning our wheels here.

382
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,308
You and me,
we gotta do something.

383
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,886
Elliot,
what's the plan?

384
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,754
We've gotta talk to Sophie right now.

385
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,790
Her mother was adamant
about giving her more time.

386
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,981
That was before he grabbed another girl.

387
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:49,995
Douglas Residence 247 E. 25th Street
Tuesday, February 20
9:04:38 AM

388
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,463
Absolutely not.

389
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,566
Mrs. Douglas, I know you don't
want this girl to go through...

390
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,001
what your daughter did.

391
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,971
Sophie has told you everything
that she remembers.

392
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,673
She might be able to remember
new details that can help us.

393
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,666
Do you know that Sophie
slept in my bed last night

394
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,612
and woke up every hour crying?

395
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,614
I am not going to let her
live through this again.

396
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,984
But there's another girl
living through it right now.

397
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,219
Look, she can't give you an address.

398
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,788
I'm sorry, Detectives,
but I'm not going to let you torture her.

399
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:21,226
Mrs. Douglas, we can have a judge
compel you to let us talk to her.

400
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:25,297
Well, then, that's what 
you're going to have to do.

401
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,798
He's had Kirsten 18 hours.

402
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,501
We could still find him before he rapes her.

403
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,172
No one is more sensitive to
this situation than Mrs. Douglas...

404
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,607
but her daughter has no more information.

405
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,609
We don't know that until we talk to her.

406
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,078
You already did.

407
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,381
Mrs. Douglas terminated 
that session prematurely...

408
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,916
leaving a lot of ground uncovered.

409
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,285
Ground that could serve no other purpose...

410
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,986
than to further traumatize the girl.

411
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,255
She will be questioned 
by Special Victims detectives.

412
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,391
They do have some experience in the area.

413
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,312
She's already told them
everything that she knows.

414
00:19:55,312 --> 00:19:56,995
It's just cruel.

415
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,932
Judge, please don't make her do this.

416
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,802
As a parent, I understand
your concern for your child.

417
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:08,006
But I have to weigh that
against the welfare of another.

418
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,409
I'm granting the application.

419
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,567
Mrs. Douglas, you are ordered
to produce your daughter.

420
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:18,491
Child Advocates Center of Manhattan
552 E. 81St Street, Tuesday, February 20
1:56:40 PM

421
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:20,118
So, Sophie,
what grade are you in?

422
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,053
Third.

423
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,244
Third.
And do you like to read?

424
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,859
Yeah, me, too.

425
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,996
When your mom brings home takeout,
like pizza...

426
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,066
do you ever notice the name
and the address on the box?

427
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,701
DeCarlo's.

428
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,905
I forget the street,
but we can walk there from where we live.

429
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:44,132
And did you have any takeout food
or pizza with the man?

430
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,580
Hey, Sophie,
it's okay.

431
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,149
We're not going to talk about
anything bad that happened there.

432
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,441
I promise, okay?

433
00:20:56,188 --> 00:21:00,483
So tell me, what did you get
to eat when you were there?

434
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,263
Cupcakes and fruit punch.

435
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,865
And what else?

436
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,769
Corn candy,
like you get on Halloween.

437
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,539
That sounds good.
But what'd you have for dinner?

438
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,310
Cupcakes and fruit punch and 
corn candy the whole time.

439
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,500
Nothing else?

440
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:25,017
No. That's all we ever had.

441
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,287
Now, Sophie, I need you 
to think really hard.

442
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,980
Do you ever remember the man
wearing a shirt with his name on it?

443
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,660
No? Do you remember
anything with a name on it?

444
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:48,674
A streamer at the party.
It had my name on it...

445
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,776
in squares, with glitter.

446
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:55,412
Okay, good. And tell me,
what else? What else was at the party?

447
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,284
Balloons.

448
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,854
He blew them up with a big machine...

449
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:05,919
and then he talked like a cartoon.

450
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,161
If he had a Sophie banner...

451
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,530
that means that he went
shopping after he abducted her.

452
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,599
Only, what, a thousand
stores sell party supplies?

453
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,168
How many of them rent helium tanks?

454
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,769
Should narrow it down considerably.

455
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,338
And if we give half to Munch and Fin...

456
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,274
When we're there, remind me to get
decorations for the twins' party.

457
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,909
I don't want to have to use
crime-scene tape for it.

458
00:22:26,434 --> 00:22:29,715
Aladdin's Party Supplies
167-31 Crossbay Boulevard Queens
Tuesday, February 20
4:20:18 PM

459
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,949
You're way off on the face.

460
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,050
You know him?

461
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,486
There's this guy,
when he smiles...

462
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,488
it takes a real effort not to flinch.

463
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,689
It might be him.

464
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,157
He come through here yesterday?

465
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,425
I didn't work yesterday.

466
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,761
But if it's the guy I'm thinking of,
he was here Friday.

467
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,664
He didn't by any chance
get a helium tank, did he?

468
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,366
Yeah, that's him.

469
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,534
Could you get the credit card
receipt for me, please?

470
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,702
He paid cash.

471
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,572
You had to take ID on the deposit
on the tank, didn't you?

472
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:58,176
We have these cute little mini-tanks now.
He just bought it.

473
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,711
How regular does he come in here?

474
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,314
Every few weeks or so.
Mostly for the seasonal candy.

475
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,416
We're one of the only places
that sells it year-round.

476
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,585
- Seasonal candy?
- You know, candy canes...

477
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:10,812
marshmallow chicks,
chocolate bunnies. It's right there.

478
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,425
That's what he gets,
the candy corn.

479
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,895
If I were him, with those teeth,
I'd lay off the sugar.

480
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,789
Thanks.

481
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,601
I want two men on that
party shop 9:00 to 9:00.

482
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,104
Nobody so much as takes a pee break
without somebody covering.

483
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,706
Benson.

484
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,643
Michael, hi.
I am so sorry.

485
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,579
Yeah, we have kind of a cluster
going on here, so...

486
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,115
Every day till the end of creation.
How's that?

487
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,584
I really can't talk right now,
so let me call you later, okay?

488
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,685
All right, thanks.

489
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,421
LUDs on that payphone come back yet?

490
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:47,025
Not yet. Kathy, you know,
I do know how important it is, baby.

491
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,027
But... Okay.

492
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,328
Yeah, I don't know.

493
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,497
Well, I'll give you a call 
in a couple of hours.

494
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,999
Okay. Bye-bye.

495
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,269
Kathy now informs me
we've been working 36 hours.

496
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,603
I got something.

497
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,439
Tell me again everything
he gave Sophie to eat.

498
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,774
Cupcakes and fruit punch.

499
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,009
And candy corn.

500
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,545
I extended the parameters.
I got three autopsy reports...

501
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,347
with those exact same stomach contents.

502
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:14,219
We got a girl from the Bronx in '98,
one in Brooklyn in '99...

503
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,088
and a Long Island girl last year.

504
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,523
All three were strangled.

505
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,359
All three were killed three days
after they went missing.

506
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,195
All three were found in water.

507
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,496
How did nobody see the pattern?

508
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,064
All from different boroughs.

509
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,732
One of them wasn't found 
for two weeks.

510
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,736
The M.E. Put T.O.D.
11 days prior. The third day.

511
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,238
Sophie escaped on her third day.

512
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,806
Six blocks from the East River.

513
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,441
Kirsten begins her third day 
in the morning.

514
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,972
I take it we're all staying.

515
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,878
Eight-year-old Rhonda Simmons,

516
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:53,258
abducted three years ago in the Bronx.

517
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,293
Raped, strangled and 
dumped in the East River.

518
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,729
Body washed up by the Navy Yards.

519
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,812
A year and a half later,
we got Sheila Wells, seven.

520
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:02,534
Grabbed from Greenpoint.
Raped, strangled.

521
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,102
Sewer workers found her.

522
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:08,006
Back at it a year later.
Kira Bly, a nine-year-old from Manhasset.

523
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,109
Same M.O. Found her in the Sound.
Are we sensing a pattern yet?

524
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,211
He's accelerating.
Only six months...

525
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,715
before Sophie.
A day before Kirsten.

526
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,850
No DNA on Rhonda.
How about you guys?

527
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,418
Zero.

528
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:23,255
Water washes away all sins,
or at least all DNA.

529
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,223
Any other similarities?

530
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,260
All five of them are white,
between the ages of seven and nine.

531
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,228
All come from working-class families...

532
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,763
described as cute and outgoing.

533
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,232
Guy's probably a loner.

534
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,201
Impulsive,
socially marginalized.

535
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,470
Okay, is this a smart guy,
or is he just fickle?

536
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,005
He keeps changing his hunting grounds.

537
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,274
I mean, are we dealing with 
a salesman, maybe a mover?

538
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,075
Let's check out the grab sites.

539
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,944
The first one was in the Bronx.

540
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,113
Next was the Brooklyn North territory.

541
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,815
Then he moves over to Long Island
and crosses to Manhattan.

542
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,017
He's moving up in affluence.

543
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,618
His confidence is building.

544
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,822
One P.P. Again.
They need to release.

545
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:58,550
I can't keep putting them off.

546
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,562
I'm not tipping all of you.

547
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,096
Sorry, Captain.
We got a problem.

548
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,531
Brass wants to go public.

549
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,666
Well,
it's their call.

550
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,167
Well, what we give them is ours.

551
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,468
I'm listening.

552
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,637
Hold back the van.
It's our only solid lead.

553
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,306
The second it's out,
he'll dump it.

554
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,541
So he dumps it?
We get a whole van full of new evidence.

555
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,944
Or he hightails it out of town,
which helps us not.

556
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,145
- Elliot?
- Best-case scenario:

557
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,446
Someone sees him,
turns him in.

558
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,581
Release the composite.

559
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,916
Hey, who died and left you Captain?

560
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,918
Lest we forget the worst-case scenario.

561
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,320
Morning paper comes out...

562
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,388
and we get a deluge of phone calls 
from whackos.

563
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,591
The woman turning in the ex
who done them wrong.

564
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,759
Neighbors turning in the freak 
down the street.

565
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,895
Leaving us here answering
thousands of false leads...

566
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,496
instead of out there finding Kirsten.

567
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:43,368
Or our guy reads the paper,
he panics, and he starts making mistakes.

568
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,136
This guy is ritual.

569
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,440
He starts with Party Day,
next is Picture Day, and in a few hours...

570
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,438
Kirsten begins her Special Day.

571
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,095
Release the composite,
a description of the van,

572
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:58,216
but hold back the time clock.
Who is that woman?

573
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:02,187
Mrs. Simmons, 
mother of one of the dead girls.

574
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,514
Whose turn is it?

575
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,756
I'm sorry.
I know you're terribly busy.

576
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,065
It's fine, really.

577
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,495
It's just, they never had a single lead.

578
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,637
I brought this for you.

579
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,310
You should really keep that.
We've one in the file.

580
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,013
Not this one.

581
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,943
This is her last school photo.

582
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:36,254
It came in the mail three weeks
after she was murdered.

583
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,923
I want it in your pocket
when you catch him.

584
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,265
Fin, I don't see latent on the pay phone.

585
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,000
We didn't get it.

586
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,602
Well, when do you plan on getting it?

587
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,703
When they're done.

588
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,406
Damn it, this place is a pigsty.

589
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,940
You're the one who said no janitors.

590
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,442
Oh, thanks, Olivia.
It's my fault.

591
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,643
- I'm...
- Pay dirt.

592
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,679
Crime lab report from the liquor store.

593
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,780
Latent?

594
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,483
I got the LUDs from the pay phone.
A 911 at 8:02 p.m.

595
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,787
Prior to that, a 10-second
local call at 7:53 p. M...

596
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,021
to Mr. Saul Garner.

597
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,490
Let's go wake him up.

598
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,727
It's 5:00 in the a.m.
What is this all about?

599
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,964
A phone call you got Monday night,
7:53 in the p.m.

600
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:23,360
Monday? Wasn't home.

601
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,207
You look like you slept on
a sewer grate last night.

602
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,575
Where were you Monday?

603
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,777
On a date.

604
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,146
Yeah, we're gonna have to
have the lucky girl's name.

605
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,283
Why? I'm telling you,
I didn't get no call.

606
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,219
Lasted about 10 seconds.
Just, like, long enough to get a message.

607
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,754
Ten seconds?

608
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,057
Maybe it was a wrong number,
or my girlfriend checking up on me.

609
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,955
Either way, I wasn't home.
Nobody left a message. I swear.

610
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,568
I take it the papers hit the stands.

611
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,836
Detective Tutuola.

612
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,605
Would you hold on one second?
Put down the paper. Pick up a phone.

613
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,741
The whacko on line one 
or the psychotic on line two?

614
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,709
Don't joke. The next tip could 
break the case. / Thank you.

615
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,112
Well, that was the psychic from California...

616
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,413
who didn't say anything much...

617
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,849
about the killings,
but did predict that half of Manhattan...

618
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,917
would slip into the river tomorrow.
Earthquake.

619
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,452
You four,
put down the phones.

620
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,820
What do you got?

621
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,623
Crime lab ran the DNA
on Sophie through the data bank.

622
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,824
We got a cold hit.
(DNA Áõ°Ÿ¸À¸·Î ¿ëÀÇÀÚ¸¦ ã¾Æ³½ °æ¿ì)

623
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,626
How? We don't have DNA
from the other cases.

624
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,130
This sample is from another body 
five years ago.

625
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,464
Sixth victim.

626
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,189
Bonnie Weathers,
a 10-year-old from Queens,

627
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:30,599
Howard Beach section.
Raped, strangled, and dumped.

628
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,803
River?

629
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,438
Abandoned warehouse.

630
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,510
Before he wised up 
and moved to the water.

631
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,708
That's why we got the DNA.

632
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,277
- Corn candy.
- If this was his first.

633
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,645
They usually start close to home.

634
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,913
In their safety zone.

635
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,348
First one's always the sloppiest.

636
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,117
Let's re-interview everybody,
starting with the cops who caught it.

637
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,886
I already talked to their captain.

638
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:48,987
You want us to go to Queens?

639
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,055
I live in Queens.
You know how long it'll take us?

640
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,092
Not as long as it's gonna take them
to get their asses down here.

641
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,157
Good point.

642
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,730
Damn it,
it's the twins' birthday.

643
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,398
I never picked up their present.

644
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,700
Well, I think you have an excuse.

645
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,564
Yeah, you come talk to me after
you cancel on Michael again tonight.

646
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,469
Tatum and Becker?

647
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,315
Did you hear something, Becker?

648
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,551
Yeah, now you mention it, I do.

649
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,086
Sounds like something
going right over your head.

650
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,756
Look, pulling the case file,
that was a boss-to-boss thing.

651
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,624
That's not how I and 
my partner operate.

652
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,328
But we're here now because we know
the important stuff is not in the file.

653
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,996
You're right.
It's in our heads...

654
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:36,154
and we're just too lazy to go out,
pick the guy up.

655
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,304
I know that we're on your turf...

656
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,105
and I would be prickly about it, too.

657
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,741
That's why I had every intention 
of coming in here...

658
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,311
and schmoozing and kissing a little ass.

659
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,847
But we have got a ticking clock,
do you understand?

660
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,920
Now, my partner and I have been on
this case for three days straight...

661
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,022
and we're too damned tired
to get in a pissing match...

662
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:02,180
so I just need to know
if you're gonna help us or not.

663
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,164
What do you want to know?

664
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,333
You interviewed over 200 people
in the Weathers case.

665
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,155
We don't have time 
to re-interview them all.

666
00:31:11,155 --> 00:31:12,969
Give us a shortcut.

667
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,541
- Who'd you like?
- Nobody good enough.

668
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,810
Okay, at this point,
we'll take anyone.

669
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,647
Just your creepy average guys
who happened to be in the vicinity.

670
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:26,544
Janitor at the school.
His name was Phil Dartman.

671
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,356
- Did he have bad teeth?
- No.

672
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:35,193
But the guy who lived down the street did,
Clayton Mills.

673
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,462
If you're looking for somebody 
with bad teeth...

674
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,598
my money's on this guy,
Joe Hayes.

675
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,467
He was dating the babysitter at the time.

676
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:45,067
Did a stint in Attica.
Assault.

677
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,570
Good luck.

678
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,201
Joe Hayes?

679
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,749
Who's asking?

680
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,685
Detective Tutuola and Munch.
Do you own a white van?

681
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,820
No.

682
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,389
But I know what this is about.

683
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,125
Really? Illuminate us.

684
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,395
You think I killed those girls
on account of that little Queens bitch.

685
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,497
He's a sharp one.
Did you?

686
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,167
I got the right to shut up if I want to.
I got work to do.

687
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,871
Doesn't look good.  An innocent man
would want to clear himself.

688
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,941
I'm an ex-con.
I'm the one you go to first.

689
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,943
I didn't rape no grade-schooler 
five years ago...

690
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,542
and I sure as hell...
didn't do nobody now.

691
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,418
It's Munch.
I need a 24-hour detail...

692
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,882
on a guy we're sitting on till they get here.

693
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:37,922
Dawson's Photo Studio
88-07 153Rd Avenue Queens
Wednesday, February 21
10:27:17 Am

694
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,390
Looking for a Mr. Mills.

695
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,260
Sure, Clayton works here.
Why?

696
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,561
Did he do something wrong?

697
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,063
No, we just want to chat with him.

698
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,698
Is he a photographer?

699
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:50,668
He's a wannabe.
But he doesn't really have it.

700
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,170
Yet you still keep him around.

701
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,038
He's available when I need him.

702
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,840
Do you work with the schools a lot?

703
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,744
Yes. It's my bread and butter.
Keeps me busy year-round.

704
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,846
Now, does Clayton come 
with you to these shoots?

705
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,949
You know, he does the lights,
he lugs the equipment. Why?

706
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:09,520
That background look familiar to you?
Is this one of yours?

707
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,489
- Yeah.
- Clayton working today?

708
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,824
No, he called in sick.

709
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:17,395
Okay. Is this a current address for him?

710
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,232
Yeah. He rents a room from an old woman.

711
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,634
He used the schools 
as a hunting ground.

712
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,824
Mrs. Rapoport.

713
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,303
Go, go, go.

714
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,234
Nobody.

715
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,535
You guys?

716
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,704
We're clear.
Nothing up there.

717
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,073
Well, well, well.

718
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,442
Kirsten.

719
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,977
Today's paper.

720
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,905
Look.

721
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,937
We're too late.

722
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,386
Say hello to Mrs. Rapoport.

723
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,188
She must have walked in on him.

724
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,755
I guess Clayton doesn't like surprises.

725
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,664
The neighbor said 
the landlady took a junket...

726
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,199
to Atlantic City last Friday.

727
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,534
The day Sophie was taken.

728
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,469
It was supposed to be a four-day stint.

729
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,571
She lost all of her money,
so she came back a day early.

730
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,207
The neighbor said that she does this 
few times a year.

731
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,909
We thinking these the times 
the guy struck?

732
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,911
It's the only time 
he has the run of the house.

733
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,448
She's got four hours left to live.
We gotta track down family and friends...

734
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,783
Elliot, she's already dead.

735
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,920
This guy is on the run.
You think that he's sticking to a time-clock?

736
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,089
We proceed under the assumption
she's still alive.

737
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,156
You know that.

738
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,392
Proceed? What are we gonna proceed to?
What are we gonna do?

739
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,461
Get a few minutes of rack time, 
both of you.

740
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,429
Take a nap.
I'll let you know how it turns out.

741
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,530
- Screw you.
- Screw you.

742
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,865
Now, that's enough,
both of you.

743
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,533
You got out and get some fresh air.

744
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,633
- Elliot, you talk to your wife.
- What?

745
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,943
How old are you guys again today? 
Five?

746
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,044
Eight.

747
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,979
Eight? No, you're not.
You're eight?

748
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,147
You know something?

749
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,349
I think Uncle Munchie has some
pudding cups under the...

750
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,218
Yeah, you know where 
the pudding cups are.

751
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,054
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

752
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,289
I'm so sorry, Kath.
I got, like, two seconds.

753
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,526
We'll take them.

754
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,595
- Did you get the...
- Yeah. They're taken care of.

755
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,829
Good.

756
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,832
It's fuzzy and black.

757
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:39,337
It is fuzzy and black.
I don't think I have anything for you guys.

758
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,902
Bought you a present.

759
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,611
This is the best present
a guy's ever had. Thank you.

760
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,547
Elliot. Got something.

761
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,011
- Okay, I love you. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

762
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,688
- Fin just called in.
- Okay.

763
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:58,890
- Remember Saul?
- Saul...

764
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,958
Last call from the pay phone
where Kirsten was grabbed.

765
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,327
Guy said he wasn't home,
had no idea who it could've been.

766
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,898
Munch and Fin paid a return
visit to his pawnshop.

767
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,933
Clayton needs to flee and 
he needs traveling money.

768
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,503
Took a little arm-twisting, but he finally
admitted that Clayton called him back.

769
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,172
Okay, so Clayton's going to the pawnshop.

770
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,697
No, He's afraid to drive into New York City.

771
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:17,708
He wants Saul to meet him in Brooklyn.

772
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,739
Beautiful.

773
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:24,015
Redhook Warehouse District Brooklyn
Wednesday, February 21
3:07:55 PM

774
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,783
The van is clear.

775
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:29,453
Delta 1 in position.
Delta 2 set.

776
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,677
We're all set.

777
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,093
We're good down here.

778
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,124
Copy that.

779
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,965
What's he unloading,
Barbie dolls?

780
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:45,036
Some old broad's got an attic full of
antiques and jewelry he sells for her.

781
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,971
The landlady he bludgeoned to death.

782
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:52,577
Furthest stretch, 
I considered he might be a thief.

783
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,112
But a kid-raping killer?
Not a clue.

784
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,248
You do anything to tip him off,
you're going down...

785
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,783
as a kid-raping accomplice.
Got me?

786
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,085
- What if he shoots me?
- I'll live.

787
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:05,756
He's not going to shoot you.
Every sharpshooter in the city is out there.

788
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,619
- I don't see anyone.
- Every building, every roof.

789
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:18,069
- He's here.
- Don't talk. Don't look down at me.

790
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,905
- He's getting closer.
- Saul.

791
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,673
Why aren't they stopping him?

792
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,742
They need a few seconds
to close off the rear flank.

793
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,844
If he sees you talking,
he's gonna know it's a setup.

794
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,113
- He's almost here.

796
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,884
If your lips keep moving,
I'll kill you myself.

797
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,153
Saul.

798
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,582
Bring it over here.

799
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,881
Freeze! Police! Right there!

800
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:07,607
Let me see your hands!
Both hands out of the car, now!

801
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,815
Come on.

802
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,894
Clayton Mills, do not move.
You're under arrest.

803
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,596
You have the right to remain silent.

804
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,663
Kirsten? Honey?

805
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,408
It's okay.

806
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,354
It's okay.
It's all over.

807
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,955
We're going home.

808
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:55,266
Rikers Island Correctional Facility
Thursday, February 22

809
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,202
My client would like to 
discuss the terms of a deal.

810
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,304
Your client rapes and kills children.

811
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:04,308
The only deal he's getting 
is a free last meal.

812
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:09,246
My client has disclosed to me that
at some point in the past...

813
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:13,250
he took the life of a young girl
and disposed of the body.

814
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,152
We already know that,
Mr. Mills.

815
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:18,980
In fact, we know about
all four of the girls you killed.

816
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,849
Five.

817
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:28,160
Apparently there's a fifth victim
whose body has never been recovered.

818
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,872
Four bodies puts a needle in your arm.
I don't need a fifth.

819
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,405
I bet the mother would like some closure.

820
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,748
Tell me the girl's name.

821
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,282
That he won't tell me.

822
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,711
She was my first.

823
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,512
A perfect little princess.

824
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,018
Sweet as can be.

825
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,621
Give me her name.

826
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,388
Take the death penalty off of the table...

827
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,895
and I'll shout it from the rooftops.

828
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,880
I need you to authorize this deal.

829
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,783
Counselor,
I am a public servant.

830
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,552
And the public at large does not want...

831
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:26,290
this boil on the butt of humanity
living to a ripe old age.

832
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,834
Charlie, think of the mother.

833
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:28,726
I am.

834
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,543
And I'm sure that 
she'd want to see him die.

835
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:31,796
Maybe.

836
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,632
But she probably wants to know
what happened to her daughter, also.

837
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,996
What about the mothers 
of all his other victims?

838
00:40:36,996 --> 00:40:38,502
They want him dead.

839
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,237
The city wants him dead.

840
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:45,309
Even protestors against the death
penalty want to see this guy dead.

841
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,379
You don't know all of the other 
mothers want him dead.

842
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,740
Of course they do.

843
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,309
Mrs. Douglas.

844
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,928
This is Sophie Douglas' mother.

845
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:07,131
One of Clayton Mills' victims.

846
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,602
Mrs. Douglas.
I am truly sorry...

847
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,327
about what Sophie endured.

848
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:20,309
Thankfully,
she did escape with her life.

849
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:25,015
What do you think should happen to him,
Mrs. Douglas?

850
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,046
He raped her.

851
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:31,251
And he killed her childhood.

852
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,017
I want him dead.

853
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:41,131
Look, it's more unbearable than
you can ever imagine.

854
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:45,202
I cried every second 
that Sophie was missing.

855
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,138
I wanted to crawl out of my skin.

856
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:53,477
Sometimes I didn't realize that I'd be
screaming at the top of my lungs.

857
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:57,715
I mean, not knowing for three days
nearly killed me.

858
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:03,153
I can't imagine this poor woman
going through that for years.

859
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:07,050
And letting it go on for the rest of her life?

860
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,593
I mean,
I want him dead...

861
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:13,785
but you've gotta help this woman.

862
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,555
Get him away.

863
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,679
- Mrs. Lehr?
- Yes.

864
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:15,114
