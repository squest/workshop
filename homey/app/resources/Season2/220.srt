1
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,232
In the criminaljustice system

2
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:29,017
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous.

3
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:30,173
In New York City

4
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:33,133
the dedicated detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

5
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,769
are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

6
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,519
These are their stories.

7
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:43,736
Tag and bag as soon as
the detectives are through.

8
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:45,319
She's been out here long enough.

9
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:46,525
What's up, Doc?

10
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:49,308
Veronica Tandy...
34 years old,

11
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:51,633
stabbed in the back,
raped from behind.

12
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,857
- Any fluids?
- Not that I can see.

13
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:56,897
We'll swab. Hopefully,
find traces with the Luma.

14
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,131
I've got a domestic homicide mid-town...

15
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,887
so I've scheduled the
autopsy later this afternoon.

16
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,822
- Don't be late.
- Don't be late.

17
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:07,804
She's got a bruise on her neck.

18
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:09,316
She was yoked.

19
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:13,623
External examination found
no traces of semen.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,714
Further testing...

21
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:19,901
showed spermicides usually
found in condoms.

22
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,462
This is fun.

23
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,682
Damn.

24
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:25,196
Problem?

25
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:29,354
Single fetus present,
seven to eight weeks.

26
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:31,385
That'll probably get suppressed at trial.

27
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,706
According to the law,
a fetus is not a person.

28
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:38,268
The stab wound was 2 inches wide,
8 inches deep, one edge serrated.

29
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,147
That's a big knife.

30
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:41,140
Cause of death?

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,826
Cardiopulmonary failure.

32
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:45,746
The blade entered the back between
the ribs,collapsing the left lung.

33
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,683
Takes care of any screaming.

34
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:49,831
Could you grab that?

35
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,734
Morgue.

36
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:54,895
Be right out.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,667
Husband's here to ID the body.

38
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,378
Mr. Tandy?

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,413
I'm Det. Benson from
the Special Victims Unit.

40
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:07,493
Are you alone?

41
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:10,520
It's a mistake.

42
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:14,305
My wife isn't here.

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,893
Mr. Tandy...

44
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:26,006
She's supposed to be home.

45
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:28,091
She's supposed to be home!

46
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,507
She's supposed to be home!

47

Law & Order SVU
2x20. Pique

59
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,906
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2001/05/04

60
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:35,448
We were supposed to meet
last night at Cafe des Artistes at 7:00.

61
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:38,838
When she didn't show up,
I called her assistant...

62
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:41,005
Charlene.

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,870
She said that she'd left early...

64
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,647
around 4:00.

65
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:48,632
Did she say where she was going?

66
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:51,800
No. I just assumed she'd be recruiting.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,210
Recruiting for what?

68
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,886
Well, she's the head of personnel...
for Compugame.

69
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,009
They manufacture game software.

70
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:05,417
Had she received any threatening
phone calls or letters recently?

71
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:08,264
Was she having any difficulties at work?

72
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:11,102
Anybody giving her trouble, a hard time?

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,299
People get fired, they blame her.

74
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,401
But that just goes with the job.

75
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,764
Anyone in particular?

76
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:24,367
We tried not to talk shop at home.

77
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,329
How did...

78
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:31,945
I mean, how did Ronnie die?

79
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:36,806
Your wife was stabbed.

80
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,680
What am I supposed to tell our kids?

82
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:51,941
Is there anyone we can call?
Someone to help you?

83
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:54,012
Family's on the way.

84
00:04:57,354 --> 00:04:59,618
Mr. Tandy...

85
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:03,434
were you aware your wife was pregnant?

86
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,061
What?

87
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,365
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,509
Did our victim fight back?

89
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,195
Doesn't look like she had a chance.

90
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:20,218
Why kill her if she didn't see his face?

91
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:23,394
We're thinking it's one guy
here who's escalating?

92
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,530
Or someone she knew.

93
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,840
Head of personnel,
probably made a lot of enemies.

94
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,013
I would start with
whoever was fired recently.

95
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:33,228
Meanwhile, I'll get a
psych profile working.

96
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,002
Something else?

97
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:41,972
Why didn't she tell her
husband that she was pregnant?

98
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,079
She was only seven weeks along.

99
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,859
Maybe she was waiting for the best time.

100
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:49,271
Or she may have decided
to terminate, or it wasn't his.

101
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:53,381
Is your gut telling you that the grieving
husband raped his own wife...

102
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:54,971
and then brutally shived her?

103
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,763
No, but if she was having an affair
with somebody who decided...

104
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:00,601
they weren't interested in
continuing the relationship...

105
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,095
Well, let's find out if we need
to establish paternity.

106
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,189
COMPUGAME
404 WEST 43RD STREET
TUESDAY, APRIL 24

107
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,389
I just can't believe it.

108
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,590
Everyone loved Ronnie.

109
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,013
Even people she axed?

110
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:15,235
It's not fun to get fired.

111
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:18,311
Besides, the department
heads make the final cuts.

112
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,321
Don't shoot the messenger,you know.

113
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:23,448
Did anybody blame her?
You know, get loud about it?

114
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:25,019
Yes. / Who?

115
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,422
All of them. We've had...

116
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:30,954
five terminations in the past three months.

117
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,661
Should I go back further?

118
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:34,601
No. We can work with that for now.

119
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,220
The husband mentioned
that the victim left at 4:00.

120
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,825
Do you know where she went?

121
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:40,131
No.

122
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:43,024
She said it was personal.

123
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:46,839
I'm sorry, it's just hard to
hear you call her a victim.

124
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:53,199
Did Ronnie have any good
friends here at the office?

125
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,226
Teresa Steele in Legal.

126
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:57,738
They have lunch together a lot.

127
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:01,878
And Jason Mayberry in Security.
They'd meet for coffee.

128
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:05,378
Brought her flowers and made sure
she had a cab when she worked late.

129
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:07,014
Is he working today?

130
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,867
He quit two weeks ago.

131
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,349
Do you know why?

132
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,067
No, you'd have to check
with his supervisor.

133
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:14,620
I don't have access to
his confidential files.

134
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,609
Thank you. / Thank you.

135
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:21,647
I'll talk to the woman in Legal.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

136
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,807
I've known Ronnie Tandy for 15 years.

137
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:29,076
We both started here
fresh out of college.

138
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,585
What do you need to know?

139
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,055
Tell me about Jason Mayberry.

140
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:36,712
What about him?

141
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,994
I've been told that they were close.

142
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:48,739
Ms. Steele, were you aware
that Mrs. Tandy was pregnant?

143
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,150
No.

144
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:55,613
But she wasn't having an affair with Jason
Mayberry if that's what you're thinking.

145
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:58,400
Well, you didn't know
that she was expecting,

146
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,900
so how can you be so sure?

147
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,643
I guess I can't.

148
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:05,989
Ronnie was a bleeding heart.

149
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,815
She liked to help people get ahead.

150
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:12,089
She encouraged Jason to go
back to school...find his niche.

151
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,376
Nothing wrong with that.

152
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,750
So why are you insinuating otherwise?

153
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,876
Well, I'm just asking questions.

154
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:20,669
Jason Mayberry sent her flowers.
They met for coffee...

155
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,508
She wrote letters of recommendation,

156
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:24,981
talked to a few peopleon his behalf.

157
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:26,668
I expect he felt grateful.

158
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:28,541
Recommendations for what?

159
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:31,142
To attend the Police Academy.

160
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:34,686
Jason just suddenly quit.
He was good at the job.

161
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:37,069
Took pride in it. Could've been a
supervisor in another six months.

162
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:38,393
Why did he quit?

163
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,372
Working security is
not exactly a glamour job

164
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:42,001
and the pay is right at minimum.

165
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:44,664
But to guess, I'd say he
quit because he was embarrassed.

166
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:45,477
Embarrassed about what?

167
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:46,907
His mother. You know the type.

168
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:50,204
Can't cut the strings. Called a lot.
Came down here once.

169
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:52,145
Busted his chops right in front of us.

170
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,006
Never could hold his head up after that.

171
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:54,820
You can take your break.

172
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,544
Do you know where
Jason's working now?

173
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:57,983
Nope.

174
00:08:58,236 --> 00:08:59,565
Address?

175
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:01,841
Got one here in Jersey. Why?

176
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,347
He and Mrs.Tandy were close friends.

177
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:05,404
He might know whether
anyone was bothering her.

178
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:07,008
I can tell you that.

179
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:08,583
Greg Spector couldn't stand her.

180
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,178
He was a guard supervisor up
until a month ago.

181
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:12,526
She fire him?

182
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,827
Jason turned him into Mrs. Tandy.

183
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:19,069
Accused Greg of using the security
cameras to zoom in on women's body parts.

184
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,990
You got an address for him?

185
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,980
He's working janitorial at LaGuardia.

186
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,018
A little pet tells a lie,
and I get canned.

187
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,847
It was a good job,$15 an hour.

188
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,068
You get in her face? You have words?
You threaten her?

189
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:38,382
I didn't threaten. I said I wasn't going
without a fight and that she'd be sorry.

190
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:40,646
She's sorry. She's dead.

191
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,265
- Is that true?
- Where were you last night?

192
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,001
I was home alone.
I had nothing to do with this.

193
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,372
Greg, this does not look good for you.

194
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,186
I'm telling you,I didn't do it.

195
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:54,128
Ronnie came to see
me about a week ago.

196
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,093
- About what?
- My side of the story.

197
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:00,363
I was the one who caught
Jason using the security camera.

198
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:02,353
Next thing I know, I'm fired.

199
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,550
So what made her call you in?

200
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,745
I don't know.

201
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:07,912
She said something about
getting me reinstated.

202
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:12,685
I got the impression that
he wasn't her little pet anymore.

203
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:17,713
HOME OF GRACE MAYBERRY
MONTCLAIR, NEW JERSEY
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 25

204
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:20,426
Jason hasn't lived here for two years.

205
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:24,332
He doesn't like it here.
It reminds him of his father.

206
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,345
He died when Jason was five.

207
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:30,319
Do you have a current address?

208
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:32,401
I am his mother.

209
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,581
We'll need to speak with
your son, Mrs. Mayberry.

210
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:36,492
Concerning what?

211
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,136
It's a police matter.

212
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,361
What has he done?

213
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:43,507
We just need to ask him
some routine questions.

214
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,874
I don't like cryptic conversations.

215
00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:55,171
They require a prevaricating
nature, which I do not possess.

216
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:58,938
So either you tell me
what this is all about...

217
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:02,321
or you can locate Jason
using whatever means...

218
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:04,783
you have at your disposal.

219
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:07,429
Do you know what obstruction is, ma'am?

220
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:08,712
This is a murder investigation,

221
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,781
and we need to speak with your son.

222
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,467
Now.

223
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,772
Police.

224
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,357
Just a minute.

225
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,604
Yes?

226
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:34,792
I'm Det. Benson. This is
my partner, Det. Stabler.

227
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,669
We're working on the Veronica
Tandy murder.

228
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:41,221
Yeah, I know. I heard.

229
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,507
It's awful.
Do you know what happened?

230
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,654
Well, we'd like to ask you a few questions.

231
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:47,577
Do you mind if we step inside?

232
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:51,577
Well, it's a mess.

233
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,223
We don't mind.

234
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,262
I do.

235
00:11:56,283 --> 00:12:00,866
Well, tell you what. We can bring you
on down to the precinct, fill you in there.

236
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:05,831
Greg Spector.

237
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,467
He hated her.

238
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,237
We've already talked to him.

239
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,969
Well.

240
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:16,248
I don't really see how I can help you then.

241
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,743
Jason.

242
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:23,567
We really need your help.
We're running out of leads.

243
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,147
Help us find this guy...

244
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,535
for Veronica.

245
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:37,937
Okay.

246
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,636
Anything for her.

247
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,223
This is Dr. George Huang...

248
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:52,797
psychiatrist on loan from the FBI,
setting up VICAP.

249
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:54,488
This is Det. Olivia Benson.

250
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:56,126
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

251
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,423
- And Elliot Stabler.
- Hi.

252
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,957
Well, what do you got?

253
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:02,009
Well, we're thinking Jason's our guy.

254
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:05,574
He agreed to chat with us.
So we'll sit with him, try and break him.

255
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:08,032
Det. Stabler should do this alone.

256
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:10,039
Excuse me?

257
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,937
Your man has a problem with women.

258
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:14,147
If this is your guy, he's
never going to open up to you.

259
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,267
All rapists have a problem with women.

260
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:19,735
I'll sit this one out,but you're not
telling us anything new, Doctor.

261
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,533
The man who did this is extremely
shy and frequently excited.

262
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:27,464
He attacks women from
behind with yoking and frottage.

263
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:29,437
He graduated to rape and murder.

264
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:33,289
Blitz attacks from behind are
acts of concealment, not shyness.

265
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,338
Is your man bold?

266
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:37,036
Do people notice him?

267
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,732
Or is he humble?

268
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:40,818
Eager to please?

269
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:43,023
Even...

270
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,368
shy.

271
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,412
I'll stick around for the interrogation.

272
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,190
Well, it turns out that our suspect
applied to the Police Academy...

273
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,887
so we already have psych tests.
I'll go pick up his file.

274
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:05,269
Thanks. Elliot pulls anything
needs checking, we'll call you.

275
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:07,063
All right.

276
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:13,662
No disrespect intended,
but Dr. Huang just got here.

277
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:16,377
Do you believe Jason is
your perp? / Yes, I do.

278
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:17,296
Okay.

279
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,394
We're not going to convict
him on your gut, Elliot.

280
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:22,206
We don't have any hard evidence,
so we're going to need a confession.

281
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:24,138
I suggest you make
this suspect your friend,

282
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,691
because he can walk
whenever he wants.

283
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,046
How's your coffee?

284
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,113
It's pretty bad. / Coffee's
always bad in the precinct.

285
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,977
You wanna be a cop, you're
gonna have to get used to it.

286
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:46,914
How did you know about that?

287
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:48,839
Pretty small company, Jason.

288
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,697
People talk about comers.

289
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:52,319
"Comers?"

290
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,581
Guys on the fast track,
going places, doing things.

291
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:57,726
You got a rabbi, you're on
your way. That's what...

292
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,045
us cops call...

293
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:04,010
a guardian angel that oversees
career moves on the force.

294
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:07,170
A rabbi. Did you know that?

295
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,883
No.

296
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,629
So when do you start the Academy?

297
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:13,398
They haven't called me yet.

298
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:19,727
There's gotta bea snag in there.
Tell you what, I'm gonna look into it for you.

299
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:22,185
Where are you working in the meantime?

300
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:26,052
Fortress Armored Cars.
Just short term till I get the call.

301
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,746
Good job. Pay well?

302
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,661
No, not during training.

303
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:35,475
So why'd you quit your last job?
I heard you were up for shift supervisor.

304
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:39,456
Yeah. Well, I don't need to work so...

305
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:44,245
Can't feel very good having
Mommy pay the bills.

306
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,052
She does not pay my bills.

307
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:49,721
I have a trust.

308
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:53,885
Why work at all?

309
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,429
To have some where to go.

310
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,371
To take pride in something.

311
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,698
Why quit where everyone respected you...

312
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,467
and recognized your work ethic?

313
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:06,751
I'd really rather not say.

314
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:09,672
Okay.

315
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:14,894
Maybe you quit before
they could fire you?

316
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:17,487
They find out something about you?

317
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:21,031
Catch you, you know, stealing?
Or sleeping on the job?

318
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,902
Maybe use the security cameras to
zoom in on women's breasts?

319
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,626
Is that your thing, Jason?
Or are you an ass man?

320
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:27,916
No.

321
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,525
I never did that.

322
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,419
That was Greg Spector.

323
00:16:41,923 --> 00:16:43,851
So why did you quit?

324
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:56,659
Well, I was... Okay.
I was being sexually harassed.

325
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,011
I liked her. I just didn't want
to get her in any trouble.

326
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:02,712
So I couldn't work there anymore.

327
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,767
Sexually harassed by who?

328
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:11,936
Veronica Tandy.

329
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:15,137
Det. Benson.

330
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:18,858
Our camcorder broke.

331
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:20,392
Mr. Tandy, I'm sorry...

332
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:23,294
Our camcorder broke three months ago.

333
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:25,354
My wife bought me a new one.

334
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,605
Big surprise came today.

335
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:32,235
- I know you're upset...
- No, you've been digging.

336
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:36,982
You've been dirtying my
murdered wife's name.

337
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,141
We have to follow leads.

338
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:44,913
Read the card, Detective.

339
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:48,731
- Mr. Tandy I had to do my...
- Just read it!

340
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,071
"For baby Tandy number four.
Shoot till you drop.

341
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:59,484
"Love, Ronnie."

342
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:01,956
She bought the camera...

343
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,336
for our new baby.

344
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:07,000
Wasn't having an affair.

345
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:14,121
You satisfied now?

346
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,486
NEW YORK CITY
POLICE ACADEMY
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 25

347
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:24,375
Mayberry passed the written,
just barely passed the physical.

348
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,577
Not exactly buff but,
hell, we need the bodies.

349
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:29,150
- Did he pass the psych exam?
- No, not even close.

350
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,544
Profile skewed towards
aggression during stress.

351
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,740
I thought that was normal.

352
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,073
Not at those levels.

353
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:35,671
We have plenty of cops on the street

354
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:38,474
with excessive force complaints
in their files.

355
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,952
Even psychos know how
to pass the psych exam.

356
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:44,959
Which was why we figured this
guy must be a real secret squirrel.

357
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:46,992
Look, why is...

358
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,835
Why are there two letters of
recommendation from Veronica Tandy?

359
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:52,220
One's a glowing review.
One's a rescind letter.

360
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,831
She pulled her support?

361
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:55,100
Do you know why?

362
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,767
I called to ask her before the
psych report came back.

363
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,668
She never returned my call.

364
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:05,656
I don't think I'm helping you at all,
and I'm getting kind of tired so...

365
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:07,642
Jason, trust me.
You're being very helpful.

366
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:10,991
What we're doing here is
called victimology.

367
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:14,985
Ascertaining character and
personality traits of the victim.

368
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,805
Determine how and
why they were chosen.

369
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:19,321
Listen to this guy.
You sound like a cop already.

370
00:19:19,463 --> 00:19:21,862
Now, you said that the
victim harassed you.

371
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,358
And why didn't you turn her in?

372
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:26,597
She would've lost her job.

373
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,495
She has a family. / Had.

374
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:32,017
Jason, she only exists n the
memories of people who love her.

375
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,633
They didn't know her.

376
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,081
This comes out, it'll hurt them. / Jason.

377
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,094
What we discuss in this
room does not leave here.

378
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:47,531
Now you sure you didn't
encourage her in some way?

379
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:48,991
You sent her flowers.

380
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:50,055
The two of you met for coffee.

381
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,254
Yes, after she did me a favor.

382
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:54,418
She was always doing me favors.

383
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:56,698
I thought that was just the
way she was with everyone.

384
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:59,223
But it wasn't true.

385
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:01,264
She was hung up on me.

386
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:05,335
She called me at home.
She dropped by unannounced.

387
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,252
She's a beautiful woman.
Weren't you flattered?

388
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:12,995
Yeah, sure. At first I was.
But Ronnie was married with kids.

389
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:15,212
You disapproved of her.

390
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:18,283
Married people have no right,
no business fooling around.

391
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,746
You let her run you out of the company.

392
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,138
She made you leave your good job.

393
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,028
Why would you do that?

394
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:24,751
What else was I gonna do?

395
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:28,511
She imagined this
relationship that did not exist.

396
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,498
And she lied a lot.

397
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:31,873
That must've made you mad.

398
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:34,740
Yeah, you just don't know how much.

399
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:38,023
Look, I sent her thank you
flowers. It's a come on.

400
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:42,206
I hailed her a cab, she's asking
me to have drinks with her.

401
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:45,560
You know, she's pregnant.
She shouldn't have been drinking.

402
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,260
How'd you know she was pregnant?

403
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,546
She told me.

404
00:20:55,698 --> 00:20:58,576
She told you but not her husband?

405
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:07,369
She didn't tell anybody
else but you. Is that it?

406
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:11,697
So what? We were close.

407
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:15,363
When did she tell you?

408
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:22,331
I don't remember exactly when.

409
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,384
Take a second.

410
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:35,645
How about a search warrant, Counselor?

411
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:36,786
Based on what?

412
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:38,524
Your gut or Dr. Huang's supposition?

413
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:39,340
Well, what do you suggest?

414
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,632
Because he's about
ready to walk out that door.

415
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:46,082
- Let him walk.
- What did you just say?

416
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,397
Let him walk.

417
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:50,225
That bastard knew she was pregnant...

418
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,733
and he killed her anyway.
He is not going out of my sight.

419
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,956
You can't force
him to stay, Detective.

420
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:57,192
It becomes a custodial issue,
and anything he says...

421
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,862
without a Miranda
warning is inadmissible.

422
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:00,533
You're tying our hands.

423
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,864
Then even the playing field.

424
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,828
How? / He hates women.

425
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:07,514
Get on his level,
the nastier the better.

426
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:11,015
Won't that make him
suspicious? / Probably.

427
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:13,237
But he wants to talk.

428
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,145
He was in charge
when he killed the victim.

429
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:20,077
But how will any body know
his power unless he reveals it?

430
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:35,274
Bad news?

431
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:40,500
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

432
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:45,802
Stupid, stone-crunching slut.

433
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:47,584
Who?

434
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,244
My wife.

435
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,194
How long you been married?

436
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:59,034
Sixteen year sentence.
Sixteen long, dry years.

437
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:02,266
Any kids?/Too many.

438
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:04,415
Creditor just called.
I'm in hock up to my ass.

439
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:09,129
My wife shops,
and if I take away her credit cards...

440
00:23:09,746 --> 00:23:13,425
she don't give me any.

441
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:22,952
Let me guess...
your oldest child is 16.

442
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,626
How did you know that?

443
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:33,673
You're a cliche, Detective.

444
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,180
A responsible guy.

445
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:42,200
Good man gets caught out there.
Woman is just looking for a free ride.

446
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:45,341
Your only refuge is the job.

447
00:23:45,787 --> 00:23:47,779
It's the only peace you have.

448
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:50,916
- I love my job.
- Why wouldn't you?

449
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:56,349
You get to catch the bad
guys and put them away.

450
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,275
But the best part is the why...

451
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:05,043
understanding the motive.

452
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:08,418
There's usually a reason.
An innocent victim...

453
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:12,019
very rare.

454
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:24,105
Do you really think that's true?

455
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:27,960
I've been doing this a long time,
Jason. I know it's true.

456
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:33,330
The women victims,
for the most part...

457
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:37,736
were asking for it.

458
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,446
They take our manhood.

459
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,413
They suck us dry.
They mess with our heads.

460
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:47,021
And then they're surprised
when we fight back.

461
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,402
Do you think that
Veronica was asking for it?

462
00:24:57,402 --> 00:25:00,279
Is that her victimology?

463
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:04,863
You knew her. You tell me.

464
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:10,137
She was...

465
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:12,625
She was a bitch.

466
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:18,118
What did she do to you?

467
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,379
I told you.

468
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,173
No, I know there's more.
I can see.

469
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:27,196
I see it in your eyes.
She hurt you badly.

470
00:25:32,004 --> 00:25:34,818
What did she do to you, Jason?

471
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:41,820
She took my dream.

472
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:47,412
She wrote a letter to the Academy
saying that I wasn't fit.

473
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:04,057
She wanted me to meet her out
in front of some department store.

474
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:08,895
She told me that if I slept
with her, she could fix it.

475
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,591
We made out.

476
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:16,461
But I couldn't do it.

477
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:20,449
I like her husband.
He's a nice guy.

478
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:23,964
Which department store?

479
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:29,920
Crazy Bob's on Lexington.
They sell electronics.

480
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:35,821
FORTRESS ARMORED CARS
648 WEST STREET
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 25

481
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:37,712
Mayberry's only been here two weeks.

482
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:39,891
And now he's going
into the Police Academy.

483
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,394
Training alone takes a month.

484
00:26:41,394 --> 00:26:43,212
He should've told you that.

485
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:44,918
He a good employee?

486
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:46,249
I suppose.

487
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:48,416
A little Chatty Kathy about his girlfriend...

488
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,964
but he's usually here on time,
and that's all I care about.

489
00:26:50,964 --> 00:26:53,000
This girlfriend have a name?

490
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:55,713
You ask me,
the woman in the photographs

491
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:57,574
doesn't even know he exists.

492
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,159
What do you mean?

493
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,799
Thanks. / I'll show you.

494
00:27:04,495 --> 00:27:07,106
- Why no doors?
- They got something to hide...

495
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:10,574
they can leave it at home. Here it is.

496
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,028
Go get that search
warrant, Counselor.

497
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:20,937
The perps got photos of our victim,
Veronica Tandy.

498
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,347
Hey, guys, what have we got so far?

499
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:29,282
Well, aside from this guy's cop
fixation, not much.

500
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:30,598
Okay.

501
00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:34,083
So let me guess, no trophies,
no 8-inch serrated Rambo knife?

502
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:36,676
No. We just got here.

503
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:45,992
Well, I'll be damned. / Yeah.

504
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:49,316
Looks like Jason wears
a condom every day.

505
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,789
No one said anything about
a roommate. Whose are these?

506
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:03,006
Maybe a girlfriend,or he's a cross-dresser.

507
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:08,065
Monogram says they belong to a GM.

508
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:11,553
Look, dirty laundry...

509
00:28:11,553 --> 00:28:13,348
including women's panties.

510
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:14,825
Detective.

511
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:15,721
Where did you find those?

512
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:17,579
On top of that cabinet right there.

513
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:22,181
Look. Looks like a bunch of bloody
hatpins with locations attached.

514
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:25,177
Okay. Make out a list and
call them into Cragen.

515
00:28:25,177 --> 00:28:26,366
Why?

516
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:29,057
Because our suspect used
these to practice.

517
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:32,136
Also, I need you to walk those
panties through the lab.

518
00:28:32,136 --> 00:28:33,567
- I'm on it.
- Rush the DNA.

519
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:36,949
- Up to what level?
- Mitochondrial.

520
00:28:38,397 --> 00:28:40,293
Been holding out on me.

521
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,641
No, I'm not. / You've been holding
out on me, and I don't like it.

522
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:46,718
I don't like being played. Now,
I have treated you like a man.

523
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:51,686
I have respected you. And you've
been treating me like some bitch.

524
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:55,410
- No. I would never do that.
- You have and you still are.

525
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,704
Now...

526
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,603
women should be lied to.
They don't understand men. They never will.

527
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:05,984
I know you've been lying to me.

528
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:08,458
And it's going to stop right now.

529
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:11,955
- I want to go home.
- "I want to go home."

530
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:15,740
We found the pictures,
you know that?

531
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:19,377
- What pictures?
- Sad...

532
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:23,070
desperate photos of Veronica Tandy
that you had taped in your locker.

533
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,183
Now, you told everyone
she was your girlfriend?

534
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:34,718
- She was my girlfriend.
- I thought she harassed you...

535
00:29:34,718 --> 00:29:35,914
tried to force you into her bed.

536
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:40,088
Now all of a suddens
She's your girlfriend? Huh?

537
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:44,384
You wouldn't know what to
do with a woman if you paid her.

538
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:46,613
Now you're insulting me.
I don't have to take this from you.

539
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:49,909
You do. You expect me to believe
this beautiful woman chose you...

540
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:53,420
cheated on her husband,
had a passion for you?

541
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,139
- What? What's the matter?
- I'm leaving.

542
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:59,688
Go ahead. I can't stop you.

543
00:30:00,993 --> 00:30:04,257
You walk out, you look guilty.
Everyone is gonna think that you did it.

544
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:06,066
And your big-time socialite mom.

545
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:09,050
Now what do you do think the
press is gonna do with that?

546
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,257
They're gonna hound you. They're
gonna follow you every where you go.

547
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:16,439
Now is that what you want?
Go ahead. Bye-bye.

548
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,028
I loved her.

549
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,066
Ronnie was gonna leave...

550
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:29,921
that pitiful excuse for a man
to be with me.

551
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:33,049
But then she couldn't
because she got pregnant.

552
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:35,291
- That baby could be mine.
- That baby is dead.

553
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:40,733
Mother's dead, baby's dead.
You killed them both.

554
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:44,564
You're just making this up because
you have to blame someone. It wasn't me.

555
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:46,904
You yoked her! You raped her!

556
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:50,213
And when she pleaded for her
life and that of her unborn child...

557
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:53,839
you stuck your knife into her
back to make her shut up.

558
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,424
That's what really happened,
Jason. Just admit it.

559
00:30:56,424 --> 00:30:59,637
No! I did not kill her!

560
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:01,949
Yeah, you did. / No.

561
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:06,575
It was someone else, not me.

562
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:09,635
I want a lawyer.

563
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,802
Jason, I'm willing to hear
your side of the story.

564
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:14,508
But you bring a lawyer into the situation...

565
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,409
it's just gonna screw it all up.

566
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:19,157
They don't help it.
They just make it worse.

567
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,412
I'm going home.

568
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,055
Fine. You feel more comfortable there...

569
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:24,614
I'll finish up at your place.
That's fine. I'll go with you.

570
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:26,114
Why can't you leave me alone?

571
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:27,330
Huh?

572
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:33,720
Jason, we're almost done.

573
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,459
Just answer my questions,
tell me the truth... and you can leave.

574
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:48,782
Excuse me.

575
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,898
Do I need to call the police?

576
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:54,497
I'm already here.

577
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:56,662
And what do you want?

578
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:00,237
Is that your blouse?

579
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:03,047
Yes.

580
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,437
Yes, it is. Have you searched
Jason's apartment?

581
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:08,512
Yes, ma'am. / Is he a suspect?

582
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:10,502
Do you live with him?

583
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,951
My son is a lot of things,
but he's not a murderer.

584
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,996
Is he under arrest?

585
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:19,823
No. Why do you leave
your clothing at his apartment?

586
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:21,176
I told you.

587
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:22,565
Jason doesn't like it here.

588
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,492
So if I want to see him,
I have to go into the city.

589
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:29,908
We have dinner, sometimes
we go to the theater.

590
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:32,806
And after that it is too
late for me to drive home...

591
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:35,428
so sometimes I spend the night.

592
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:40,293
All of which is none of your business.

593
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:43,430
It's an awfully small apartment for
overnight guests, Mrs. Mayberry.

594
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,844
Where do you sleep?

595
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:49,052
There was only a Murphy bed,
and I didn't see a cot.

596
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,876
Why not a hotel?

597
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:53,983
Well, why stay at all?
It's not that long of a drive.

598
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:56,306
It's over an hour.

599
00:32:57,926 --> 00:33:01,399
What the hell did you do to your son?

600
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:05,647
I don't like your question,
and I don't like your tone.

601
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:08,238
Please leave.

602
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:13,763
How many attacks?

603
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:18,295
I've got six pins here with
corresponding complainants...

604
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:20,166
at locations around the city.

605
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,454
I'll bet there may have
been more that weren't reported.

606
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:25,812
He may have re-used the
pins as he built the fantasy.

607
00:33:25,812 --> 00:33:27,164
Piquerism.

608
00:33:27,164 --> 00:33:30,999
The murder was piqueristic,
and I just didn't see it.

609
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:36,175
He derives excitement
from stabbing women's flesh.

610
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,937
Six victims walking in a crowd,
suddenly attacked from behind...

611
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:43,366
and stuck with hatpins in the butts and backs.

612
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:46,217
And not one could ID her attacker.

613
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:49,825
It fits his profile.

614
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,317
What about Norfolk and Houston?

615
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:54,941
You stuck a woman in
the back with a pin...

616
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:56,944
missed her spine by an inch.

617
00:33:56,944 --> 00:33:59,004
I want to go home.

618
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,277
You can't keep me here.

619
00:34:00,277 --> 00:34:02,623
Don't you want to know how I know this?
Aren't you curious?

620
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,425
No. / We've been inside your apartment.

621
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,482
We found the hatpins.

622
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:10,628
Avenue 8th and Second Street...

623
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:13,072
I know you remember this blonde.

624
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:17,912
Broad daylight, you snuck up behind her,
and you stuck her pretty good.

625
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:39,134
Jason...

626
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:46,836
how long has your mother
been sleeping with you?

627
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:52,656
What are you talking about?

628
00:34:53,054 --> 00:34:56,429
- That's crazy.
- Jason, listen to me.

629
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:01,139
She had no right to touch you like that.

630
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:03,659
She had no right to abuse you.

631
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:07,324
You're crazy.

632
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,371
You know that. You're all...

633
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:11,286
You're all crazy.

634
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:14,526
Hey! Hey!

635
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,614
Is that what happens to
all you people here?

636
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,060
The sex police.
Sex on the brain.

637
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,668
Well, my mother never
touched me like that.

638
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:23,828
You were six years old and
still sleeping with Mommy.

639
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:25,797
What'd she say to you, Jason?

640
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:27,804
You have nightmares so you
should sleep with her?

641
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:30,230
- Keep the monsters away?
- Can we stop?

642
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,987
- Can we stop now?
- And at 10 she'd let you sleep alone.

643
00:35:32,987 --> 00:35:35,497
She'd come to you at night...

644
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:38,723
telling you, you were
the man of the house.

645
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:42,951
Why don't you just shut the hell up?

646
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:49,539
She initiated you into sexual
experience in puberty.

647
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:52,962
Jason?

648
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:55,289
You were scared because
you knew it was wrong.

649
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:59,726
You were still a boy, Jason.
You were confused, disgusted...

650
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,221
abused.

651
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:07,154
Jason, it wasn't your fault.

652
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:14,323
Yes.

653
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,824
Yes.

654
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:23,193
Yes, it was.

655
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:41,596
I'm...

656
00:36:41,596 --> 00:36:45,147
I'm a dirty little boy.

657
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,269
I can't keep my hands to myself.

658
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:55,363
You lying boy.

659
00:36:56,395 --> 00:36:59,934
Don't look. Look.

660
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,277
Don't touch. Touch me.

661
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,132
Go away.

662
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:10,845
No, come here and hold me.

663
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:14,204
Baby, doesn't that feel so good?

664
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:17,536
You're a good little boy.

665
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:25,378
Shh.

666
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,160
What are the charges?

667
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,807
Right now, murder and rape.

668
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:43,630
Was he Mirandized?

669
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,390
Counselor, nobody here is stupid.

670
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:48,071
Jason.

671
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,506
What have you done?

672
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:53,398
Do you realize what this will do to me?

673
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:58,279
What have you been saying about me?

674
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:01,063
You lied through your teeth, didn't you?

675
00:38:01,063 --> 00:38:03,466
You always lie.

676
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:06,252
You're a filthy, lying bastard.

677
00:38:06,252 --> 00:38:08,172
That's enough, Grace.

678
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:11,092
Keep your mouth shut.
I'll get you out of here in no time.

679
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:13,200
People versus Jason Thaddeus Mayberry.

680
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,234
One count, murder in the first degree.

681
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:17,377
One count, rape in the first degree.

682
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:20,106
Six counts of assault in the second.

683
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:26,080
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

684
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,777
- Ms. Cabot?
- Remand, Your Honor.

685
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:32,335
The Mayberry's are an old,
upstanding family in New Jersey.

686
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:34,736
My client is not a flight risk.

687
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:38,525
His mother, Grace Mayberry,
will produce him for trial.

688
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,461
Because of his trust,
as well as his mother's wealth...

689
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:42,388
he has means and opportunity to flee.

690
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,654
The defendant is charged
with heinous crimes.

691
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:46,128
The murder victim was
7 weeks pregnant...

692
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:48,181
Objection!

693
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:51,640
That was a nice try, Counselor.

694
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,587
Don't do it again.

695
00:38:53,883 --> 00:38:55,480
My apologies.

696
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,502
Bail is set at $1 million.

697
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,397
Post or enjoy my hospitality.

698
00:39:01,988 --> 00:39:03,701
No deal. / I'm not looking for one.

699
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:04,996
My client isn't guilty.

700
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:06,734
Your client belongs in a pine box...

701
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:09,679
but I will settle for an 8-by-10 cell
where he can rot until he dies.

702
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,004
Don't get ahead of yourself, Ms. Cabot.

703
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:14,557
I have got his
un-coerced and legal confession.

704
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:17,107
I have got bloody hatpins from
his piqueristic attacks.

705
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,749
I've got a homicide victim
who was known...

706
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:20,765
to the defendant and his motive for killing.

707
00:39:20,765 --> 00:39:23,161
I don't know if that's
over confidence or hubris.

708
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,564
That was so much fun,
I thought we'd do it again.

709
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,915
See you in court.

710
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,842
MOTION HEARING
PART 62
MONDAY, APRIL 30

711
00:39:33,842 --> 00:39:36,801
The hatpins weren't in the
scope of the search warrant.

712
00:39:36,801 --> 00:39:39,879
They were in plain view,
Your Honor. / Hardly.

713
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:42,161
The box was kept on a high cabinet.

714
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:44,462
Or will the People try to tell me
that someone in the search team...

715
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:46,237
was 7 feet tall?

716
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:47,627
They were looking for a knife.

717
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:51,238
And instead they found bloody
hatpins used in piquerist attacks.

718
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:52,899
Six victims, six hatpins,

719
00:39:52,899 --> 00:39:54,871
all labeled with corresponding locations.

720
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:57,696
If the police search for a
gun and find a bloody knife with hair...

721
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,468
I'm certainly not going to throw it out.

722
00:39:59,468 --> 00:40:02,187
Hatpins remain in evidence.Next item.

723
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:04,424
Constitutional violation.

724
00:40:04,424 --> 00:40:08,190
My client asked for a
lawyer and was denied access.

725
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:10,577
The defendant was
not under arrest at the time.

726
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,056
There was no custodial issue.

727
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:13,368
I submit he was in custody...

728
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:16,227
from the moment he was asked to
accompany the officers to their precinct.

729
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:19,259
The suspect was free to go at
any time prior to the discovery of evidence...

730
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:21,982
- in his apartment.
- Come on, Counselor.

731
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:24,998
The police are notorious for
their intimidation tactics.

732
00:40:24,998 --> 00:40:27,097
He asked for a lawyer.
He didn't get one.

733
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:30,551
Did the suspect ask for
counsel, Ms. Cabot? / Yes.

734
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:32,920
But then he wanted
to continue without one.

735
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,759
Did he want to continue,
or was he threatened?

736
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:38,422
- Your Honor, I take...
- Sorry, Counselor.

737
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:40,738
Although I'd like to agree with
you concerning custody...

738
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,611
I'm on a slippery slope,
and I'd rather err on the side of caution.

739
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,052
The confession is out.

740
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,222
He wasn't under arrest.

741
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:53,062
I specifically cautioned
you about the custodial issue.

742
00:40:53,062 --> 00:40:56,228
No, you said that he was
to be free to go at any time.

743
00:40:56,228 --> 00:40:58,275
My detective persuaded him otherwise.

744
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:00,218
He did a hell of a
job getting that confession.

745
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:01,778
Whose side you on? / Mine.

746
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:04,793
You know the trial closure rate for
sex crimes cases is four percent.

747
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:06,199
Four percent.

748
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,276
There are a lot of
factors responsible for that but I never...

749
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:11,109
I did my job, Counselor.
Don't blame me if you didn't do yours.

750
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:12,912
I stayed in that room and
pushed him to the edge.

751
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:14,699
You lost him on a technicality.

752
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:16,632
All right. That's enough, both of you.

753
00:41:16,632 --> 00:41:17,730
Do we know where he is?

754
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,173
He's in New Jersey with his mother.

755
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:21,520
I notified the locals.
They said they'd do their best.

756
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,243
That's reassuring.

757
00:41:22,243 --> 00:41:25,327
So what do we do to catch this
hump before he strikes again?

758
00:41:25,327 --> 00:41:28,115
Can you reconstruct this
movements after the attacks?

759
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,594
Well, what are we looking for?

760
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:31,880
I think he went home to his
mother after each attack.

761
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,773
He felt compelled to go to the source.

762
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:37,614
Mother created a loving
husband in her baby son.

763
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:39,889
It all starts and ends with her.

764
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:42,170
You think the murder weapon's there?

765
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:43,952
It's a possibility.

766
00:41:43,952 --> 00:41:46,898
It's gotta be somewhere.
He didn't just throw it away.

767
00:41:46,898 --> 00:41:49,962
Well, we can't go on a digging
expedition based on possibility.

768
00:41:49,962 --> 00:41:52,031
He suffers from piquerism, Counselor.

769
00:41:52,031 --> 00:41:55,160
That knife represents his penis.

770
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:57,837
It is not disposable.

771
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:02,444
OFFICE OF COUNTY PROSECUTOR
MALCOLM SANDERSON
TRENTON, NEW JURSEY
MONDAY, APRIL 30

772
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:05,573
I've shown you all my cards,
Malcolm. What's it going to be?

773
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:08,703
No judge is going to sign a
warrant based on what you've got, Alex.

774
00:42:08,703 --> 00:42:12,374
Credit card receipts from area stores
and witness statements which put him...

775
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:15,135
in his mother's house after each attack.

776
00:42:15,135 --> 00:42:16,324
What more could you possibly need?

777
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:19,801
That isn't enough to prove that he stashed
a murder weapon in his mother's home.

778
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:23,640
What has to happen before you get off
your collective asses and do your jobs?

779
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,557
Look, I know you're upset,
Detective, but the law doesn't allow...

780
00:42:26,557 --> 00:42:27,774
Just tell me what you need?

781
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:29,496
You need a New Jersey
victim to do something?

782
00:42:29,496 --> 00:42:31,120
He admitted to everything. / Detective!

783
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,079
We got his confession on tape.
We just couldn't hold him.

784
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:38,150
You don't make a lot of friends,
do you? / Yeah, well...

785
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,228
Look...

786
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:42,960
Grace Mayberry created
the man who did this.

787
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,023
By warping his mind she
destroyed his female victims...

788
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,668
as if she'd wielded the knife herself.

789
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:52,189
We got one long shot.

790
