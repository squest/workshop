<font color=3366FFIn the criminal justice system,

3
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:28,975
<font color=3366FFsexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:30,314
<font color=3366FFIn New York City,

5
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:33,600
<font color=3366FFthe dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,739
<font color=3366FFof an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

7
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:38,599
<font color=3366FFThese are their stories.

8
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,314
Guy's a slacker.

9
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:45,327
Didn't contribute,
showed up late.

10
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,684
Study group
didn't need the dead weight.

11
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:49,734
- What'd you do?
- Tossed him out on his pompous ass.

12
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:54,577
Hey, there's that bum again.

13
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,358
- What's he up to?
- Probably fertilizing the bushes.

14
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:00,053
Hey, Harry.

15
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:03,267
Where you going, Harry?

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,787
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, man.

17
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,880
Name's Kelly D'leah,
student at Hanford.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,437
Couple of joggers found her in the bushes 
off the campus quad about 7:00 a.m.

19
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:17,773
- Her condition?
- Semi-conscious, no panties...

20
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:19,594
smell of alcohol on her breath.

21
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:22,515
Cordoned off the area, called CSU.
Partner's still on scene.

22
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,307
- What'd the doctor say?
- That's him. Hey, Doc...

23
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:27,682
- Detectives Benson and Stabler.
- What do we got?

24
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:30,406
She's a little vague on the details,
but has all the earmarks.

25
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:34,252
Abrasions to knees, arms, bruising 
about the pelvis and neck, hickeys.

26
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:36,429
- Rape kit turn up anything?
- Haven't done it.

27
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,157
Once I started the exam,
she refused to proceed.

28
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:41,710
I was hoping you might be able
to persuade her.

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,451
Okay.

30
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:46,875
Just a little longer.

31
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:56,171
- And that should do it.
- Okay, Kelly. The exam's over.

32
00:01:56,171 --> 00:02:00,826
This is a high dose of oral 
contraceptives. / Birth control pills?

33
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:03,573
The doctor found semen.

34
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:08,654
- What?
- The rapist didn't use a condom.

35
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:13,076
No. / The pills will prevent pregnancy.

36
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:15,321
We'll also give you
an antibiotic for any STDs...

37
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:19,928
that may have been
transmitted. / No.

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,300
No, I can't.

39
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,881
- You can't what, Kelly?
- I can't deal with this.

40
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,078
Okay, sweetheart,
you don't have to decide right now.

41
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:30,079
But you will have to
within the next day or two...

42
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,468
or the regimen will be ineffective.

43
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:35,960
You don't understand...

44
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:40,716
I'm a virgin.

56
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:35,951
Hi, I'm looking for Kelly D'leah. 
They brought her in this morning.

57
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,568
- Are you a relative?
- No, her roommate, Dana Kimble.

58
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,458
I just brought her
a fresh change of clothes.

59
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,205
Dana. Detective Stabler.

60
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:46,095
I came as soon as the hospital called.
How is she?

61
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,089
She's still with the doctor.
Tell you what, though.

62
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,467
Come on over here,
I'll talk with you, okay?

63
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:52,965
Should be finished soon,
but in the meantime...

64
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,933
do you know
where she was last night?

65
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,606
She was out with Tess and Jodie, 
a couple of our sorority sisters.

66
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,878
They said she was still partying at the 
Beta Lambda house when they left.

67
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:04,531
- What time was that?
- About 1:30.

68
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:08,456
- They say who they left her with?
- Joe Templeton and Hank Ludlow.

69
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,538
They friends of hers?

70
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,273
I wouldn't exactly call them friends, 
but I know Joe had a thing for her.

71
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:16,652
Okay, what's that mean, "thing"?

72
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:19,432
Ever since she shot him down
at a rush party last semester...

73
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:22,150
- he's been on her to go out with him.
- Why won't she?

74
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,148
- She knows his type.
- What type is that?

75
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:26,921
He's a player.

76
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:31,538
You know, she flirts with him
to tweak his ego a little bit. / Yeah?

77
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,671
She knows where to draw the line.

78
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:38,631
That's why I got worried
when she didn't come home last night.

79
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:41,478
Okay, excuse me one second, okay?

80
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:45,670
Doctor confirms semen
and a torn hymen.

81
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,725
Unfortunately, the victim's
a little vague on details.

82
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:49,313
Blood alcohol's still point 0.4.

83
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:51,824
Roommate said she'd been out
partying with two frat boys last night.

84
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,235
Let's hope they can explain
how she wound up in the bushes.

85
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,647
I got a crime scene here.

86
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,248
Should we rescue Gordy
from the campus fuzz?

87
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:01,358
Better, or we'll be here all day.

88
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,702
Look, it'll take as long as it takes.

89
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,869
We need this area cleared
for pedestrians. / What's the problem?

90
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:08,625
We got 10,000 students
swarming this quad by 9:00 AM ...

91
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,371
and your guys are still beating the 
weeds looking for God knows what.

92
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:13,970
It's a crime scene, Barney.
They're looking for evidence.

93
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,007
Name's Monroe, Detective...

94
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,184
and crime scene or not,
this is private property.

95
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,143
The city's gonna pay
for these shrubs?

96
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:24,031
I arrest you for obstructing justice, 
the university gonna pay your bail?

97
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,653
Just make it quick, will you?

98
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:28,993
- What do you got? 
- Used condom...

99
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:31,771
handbag with the victim's
hairbrush and ID, and this scarf.

100
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:33,626
- Styling.
- Bag it all.

101
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,647
- Where are the joggers?
- Up there.

102
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:40,508
I'm Detective Munch.
This is my partner, Detective Tutuola.

103
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:44,499
- We understand you found her.
- She was laying down in the bushes.

104
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:47,096
At first, I thought she was dead,
then I heard her moaning.

105
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,515
- She say anything?
- A name. Josh, or John.

106
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:53,089
- It was hard to make out.
- Anybody else around?

107
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,209
Just this little creep
who loiters around campus.

108
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:56,722
What's he look like?

109
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,971
Greasy hair, wears an old army coat.

110
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:02,553
- Took off the minute he spotted us.
- Where can we find this guy?

111
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:11,191
Want some syrup with
those flapjacks there, slappy?

112
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:24,962
I didn't do anything.

113
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:27,937
- Why'd you run?
- You were chasing me.

114
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:36,336
- You Kelly D'leah?
- No, it's Harry.

115
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:39,547
Harry, you're under arrest
for possession of stolen property.

116
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,863
So take us through it, Kelly.

117
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:45,030
Jodie, Tess, and I left the house 
about 9:30

118
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,280
and headed to the Kollege Keg...
a bar near campus.

119
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,531
Is that where you met up
with Joe and Hank?

120
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:53,636
Yeah, they invited us to
join them at a booth.

121
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:55,437
How long did you stay?

122
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:58,976
- An hour, maybe two.
- Then what happened?

123
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:02,412
We went to the Beta house
to play video games in Joe's room.

124
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:04,542
Tell us about Joe.

125
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,447
Not much to tell.
Typical frat rat.

126
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:10,860
Your roommate said
that he had a thing for you.

127
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,465
We flirted, but it's not serious.

128
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:16,518
- What about Hank?
- You gotta be kidding me.

129
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:20,676
Did either one of these guys
make sexual advances toward you?

130
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:25,392
Not more than usual,
but we were just having fun.

131
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:29,087
How much did you have to drink?

132
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,471
One or two glasses of margaritas.

133
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,439
A few sips of beer at the house.

134
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,240
What's the last thing
that you remember that night?

135
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,154
We were all sitting on the floor,
talking, laughing...

136
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:50,481
- and after that, it gets fuzzy.
- What do you mean, "fuzzy?"

137
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:55,289
I remember feeling cold...

138
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,802
and someone pulling on my hair.

139
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:02,484
But then, nothing.

140
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:06,529
I didn't think that I was drinking 
that much, but I must have been.

141
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,472
This wouldn't have happened
if I wasn't, right?

142
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:15,345
Oh, God, what did I do?

143
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,604
What did I do?

144
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:27,562
Stellar bio you got here,
Harry. Petty theft, vagrancy.

145
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:30,689
Even pinched a couple of times
for window shopping at the girl's dorm.

146
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,833
- I never hurt anybody.
- So, why you taking souvenirs?

147
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,923
Found them in the bushes.

148
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:39,796
I was on my way to lost
and found to turn them in.

149
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:42,881
Since when is lost and found
in a dumpster?

150
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:45,500
- I had to eat first.
- Come again?

151
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,398
Breakfast leftovers,
they get tossed by 11:00.

152
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:52,295
Wanted to get my eats
while they were still hot.

153
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:56,144
- You think this is a joke?
- No.

154
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,357
No joke.

155
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:00,957
- I go there everyday.
- Not anymore.

156
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,019
We got you on possession
of stolen property.

157
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:07,310
And we're a blood test away from nailing 
your little scruffy ass for rape.

158
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,826
- Should've used a condom, Harry.
- Please, I can't stand needles.

159
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:13,693
- No needles, please.
- Then look, come at us straight...

160
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:16,381
and maybe we can work
something out.

161
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,351
All right.

162
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:25,291
I was making my rounds...

163
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,709
she came out of the house.

164
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:30,914
- What house?
- Frat house.

165
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:35,172
She was all wobbly,
like she was drunk. / What time?

166
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:40,695
Sun wasn't up, but it was
getting light. I followed her.

167
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:44,848
She fell down a few times,
got up.

168
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:49,745
Last time, she stayed down.
I went over.

169
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:52,248
She was out cold.

170
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:54,709
I took the money...

171
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,273
the cards.

172
00:09:57,273 --> 00:10:02,501
I never raped anybody.

173
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,851
You sons of bitches.

174
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:10,499
- You said I wouldn't have to take a needle.
- Yeah, well, we lied.

175
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,301
What do you think?

176
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,466
If he was moving his way up
the food chain...

177
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,991
from peeping Tom to rapist,
she would have been an easy mark.

178
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,206
On the other hand,
if his blood test comes back negative...

179
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:22,023
we're back to square one.
What did you find at the scene?

180
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:25,976
Usual collegiate artifacts, used condom. 
But since the rapist left semen...

181
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:28,444
Test it anyway.
What about the missing panties?

182
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:31,438
- Still missing.
- Along with about six hours of memory.

183
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,271
All right, talk to
her party companions.

184
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:36,262
See if we can start filling
in some of that missing time.

DELTA KAPPA DELTA
SORORITY HOUSE
MONDAY, JANUARY 8

186
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,749
We got to the house
about 11:00.

187
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,139
What'd you do once
you got there?

188
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,590
We went to Joe's room to play
strip poker on his computer.

189
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,477
- You been drinking?
- We were all pretty happy.

190
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:51,375
- But, Kelly was pretty loose.
- Really? How loose?

191
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,353
She was hanging all over Joe,
making a fool of herself.

192
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,809
- But what else is new?
- That happen a lot?

193
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,979
She was always glued
on somebody.

194
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:01,689
How long were you
at the Beta house? / For a while.

195
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:04,129
But when Kelly stripped down
to her bra and panties...

196
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:06,472
Tess and I decided
to call it a night.

197
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:09,074
You guys just left her there?

198
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:12,074
She was giving Joe a lap dance.

199
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:16,677
And Joe? / He was lapping it up.
Wouldn't you?

200
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,506
Yeah, she had the hot ticket.
And I'd have been happy to punch it for her

201
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,907
if she hadn't
have puked all over the floor.

202
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:25,090
Kind of put the old muzzle on Mr. Happy,
if you know what I mean.

203
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,506
Anybody witness
this fateful hurl?

204
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:31,379
Yeah, sure. We set up bleachers
and charged admission.

205
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,193
What did you do after the wind went out
of your little sail?

206
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,378
I left her on my bed to sleep it off. 
And I went downstairs to crash on the sofa.

207
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:40,517
I was in the TV room
watching wrestling...

208
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:43,805
and Joe came in, threw me a blanket. 
Told me we were sleeping there.

209
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:46,496
You know, luckily, I had a good buzz on.
I passed out on the floor.

210
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:49,097
And you got no idea how Kelly
wound up in the bushes?

211
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,197
Look, man, I don't know what
this chick told you...

212
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:53,396
but I heard she worked her way
through the Kappa Sigs...

213
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:56,741
- before setting her sights on Joe.
- So she had it coming?

214
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,024
I didn't say that.

215
00:11:58,024 --> 00:12:01,501
But I can tell you for a fact
that it wasn't Joe or me.

216
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:05,177
Harry's blood type
doesn't match the semen.

217
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:06,633
Any luck with her friends?

218
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:09,823
According to her sorority sisters,
she was making all the moves.

219
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:12,391
- I thought she was a virgin.
- Technically.

220
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:16,201
Word on campus was, she was doing 
a lot of practicing for her oral exam.

221
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:18,021
So she deserves to be raped?

222
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,807
We don't even know
if those rumors are true.

223
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,863
Yeah, but witnesses said
she came on to Joe.

224
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:26,039
- No, witnesses said she flirted.
- A lap dance sends a pretty strong signal.

225
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,436
- She was drunk.
- So was he.

226
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:28,356
So that excuses him?

227
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,484
No, but her behavior's
open to interpretation.

228
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,322
She might have played it out and 
woke up with a case of buyer's remorse.

229
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:36,655
- So now we're blaming the victim?
- Nobody is blaming her...

230
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:40,086
but we all know how hard it is to get 
an indictment on a he-said, she-said...

231
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:42,836
- even without the ambiguities.
- That was the lab.

232
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:46,966
Tox screen just came back.
They found traces of GHB in Kelly's urine.

233
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,419
So much for the ambiguities.

234
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,530
Only one reason
to slip someone a date rape drug.

235
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,116
Find out who spiked her drink,
you find the rapist.

236
00:12:57,887 --> 00:12:59,927
I met with the dean of students.

237
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:01,545
She said if I don't
press criminal charges...

238
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,515
she can have the university's
disciplinary committee..

239
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:06,075
handle my case
without a public trial.

240
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:10,074
- Rape is a criminal offense.
- What if it was my fault?

241
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,116
Jodie and Tess said
I was half naked when they left.

242
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,455
I don't even remember.

243
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:16,116
That's because they found GHB
in your system.

244
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:17,782
What's GHB?

245
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:20,378
It's a drug that reduces inhibitions.

246
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:23,066
The vomiting and the chills
were side effects.

247
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,305
You could have died, Kelly.

248
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,524
But I didn't take anything.

249
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:28,455
Somebody probably
slipped it into your drink.

250
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:32,391
Whoever did this to you took away 
your ability to consent to have sex.

251
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,922
He raped you.

252
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:38,995
Who? / That's what we're trying 
to find out.

253
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:41,536
But we need you to help us.

254
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:44,357
You said you were drinking
margaritas at the bar.

255
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,647
You ever leave
your drink unattended?

256
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:50,238
Joe and I got up to dance,
and I went to the restroom once.

257
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:53,691
But both times, I left my glass 
on the table with everybody else's.

258
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:56,568
- How'd you feel when you left?
- Fine, I guess.

259
00:13:56,568 --> 00:14:00,625
You go straight to the frat house?
Had a beer there?

260
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,314
They kept pouring more
into my glass.

261
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:05,332
But, that's when I started
to feel dizzy, so I stopped.

262
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:09,129
Did anybody else join you at the frat,
once you got to Joe's room?

263
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,414
Wally Parker.

264
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:12,949
Who's Wally Parker?

265
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:15,829
One of the brothers.
But he didn't stay long.

266
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,208
So, that leaves
Hank and Joe.

267
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:20,978
- You think it's one of them?
- We don't know...

268
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:24,341
but for now, why don't we just keep 
this conversation between us, okay?

269
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,685
If anything turns up,
we'll let you know.

270

1718 AMSTERDAM AVENUE
TUESDAY, JANUARY 9

271
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:34,472
You know how many frat rats
come in here every night?

272
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,094
I wonder how many of them
are underage.

273
00:14:36,094 --> 00:14:39,324
Suppose we send in
an undercover team and see.

274
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:43,566
- It's the Babe.
- Who?

275
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,384
Bets me $20 against a free beer...

276
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,249
that he can call a home run
at the top of the night...

277
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,752
like Babe Ruth in the World Series.

278
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:53,434
Points out a girl,
if he bags her, he wins.

279
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,094
- What's his batting average?
- He drinks a lot more than he pays.

280
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,702
He ever take a swing at this one?

281
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:02,803
The other night.

282
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,208
She walked in with
a couple other hotties.

283
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,519
Joe was sitting here
with his sidekick. / Hank?

284
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,446
Yeah. Joe picked her out
and laid down his bet.

285
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:11,761
Only this time,
bets me $50 against a pitcher.

286
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:14,598
- Getting cocky?
- Ain't cocky if you deliver.

287
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:16,568
Did he deliver with this one?

288
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:20,014
Half hour later,
he's walking her out the door.

289
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:23,147
I'm telling you,
guy's got an eye for the long ball.

DEAN OF STUDENTS
GERALDINE RICHTER 
TUESDAY, JANUARY 9

291
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,696
Yes, I spoke to Miss D'leah
this morning...

292
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:30,359
and I gave her my full support.

293
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,949
But you tried to talk her out
of pressing criminal charges.

294
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,770
I gave her an alternative
to criminal proceedings.

295
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,978
The decision is hers.

296
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,926
How exactly does this disciplinary 
committee of yours work?

297
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:43,758
It's composed of three
students and three faculty.

298
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:46,966
Each presents their case,
along with three other witnesses...

299
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,803
then the committee deliberates
and renders a decision.

300
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:51,843
What kind of sentences
do you hand down for rape?

301
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:54,963
Since we don't have criminal jurisdiction,
we can't incarcerate.

302
00:15:54,963 --> 00:15:57,850
However, we can suspend,
and, if warranted, expel.

303
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,897
Has Joe Templeton or Hank Ludlow 
been involved in a case like this before?

304
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:03,487
I'm not at liberty to say.

305
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:07,419
Dean Richter, you realize we're talking 
about a girl who's been drugged and raped.

306
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:09,367
I'm not unsympathetic.

307
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,702
However, I cannot release
a student's private records...

308
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:15,140
unless I have written permission,
or a court order.

309
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,458
Sometimes the thought of Maureen in 
college scares the hell out of me.

310
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,508
I don't blame you.

311
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:24,789
Higher education used to mean
B.A. S and Ph.D.s.

312
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,792
Now it's roofies and GHB.

313
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:30,005
And deans with confidential
disciplinary committees.

314
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:33,359
It's an extension of the loco
parentis role of the university.

315
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,052
They prefer to keep
these matters in house...

316
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:37,145
to save the students
the ordeal of a public trial.

317
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:39,579
And to relieve the school
of any public embarrassment.

318
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:42,860
The dean definitely did not feel comfortable
playing public relations...

319
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,776
which makes me think those student records
are gonna tell us a story.

320
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:47,810
What'll it take to
get those records?

321
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,409
The university will quash a subpoena
without more evidence.

322
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,746
Evidence. No evidence
without those records.

323
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,291
Hell of a catch-22.

324
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:59,019
If this guy is a sexual predator, 
chances are he's left other victims.

325
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,471
If we establish a pattern,
we've got our probable cause.

326
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:02,845
Any suggestions?

327
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,549
Fin and I made friends with a guy 
in the campus police department.

328
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,757
- We did?
- Nick, the campus dick.

329
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:10,750
Maybe, we can appeal to his fraternal 
sense of brotherhood among cops.

330
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,294
Kelly also mentioned a third guy 
that was in Joe's room.

331
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:14,726
Maybe he's worth a shot.

332
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:17,372
Tell you what, at this point,
anything's worth a shot.

333
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:20,897
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Wally Parker?

334
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:23,105
Can I talk to you a minute?

335
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:25,964
- Is this about Kelly?
- We heard you were there the other night.

336
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:29,164
Not for long. I had a philosophy exam,
so I left to study.

337
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:33,430
Now, before you left, did you have
any interaction with Kelly?

338
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,458
- What do you mean?
- You talk with her? / A little.

339
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,943
She seem lucid to you at the time?

340
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:43,603
- She was partying.
- Was she dressed? / - Yeah.

341
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:48,986
- Anything seem out of whack to you?
- Like what?

342
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:53,322
You tell me.

343
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,393
You either talk to us here,
or you talk to us downtown.

344
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:59,729
Because right now
we got you pegged as an accomplice...

345
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:05,323
so you'll have plenty of time to test the 
bonds of brotherhood in criminal court.

346
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:10,943
About 1:00, I went downstairs
for a drink of water...

347
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:15,585
I saw Hank and Joe
sacked out in the TV room.

348
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:20,161
And when I went back upstairs,
she was in Joe's room by herself, crying.

349
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:22,992
- Over what?
- She wouldn't say.

350
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:26,370
Her hair was messed up,
and there was vomit on the floor.

351
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,938
She looked like
she needed a friend.

352
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,649
I offered to walk her home,

353
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:34,185
and by the time
I got my coat...she was already gone.

354
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:35,634
Back to bust my chops?

355
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:37,651
Actually, we came to apologize.

356
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,508
We might have been
a little harsh with you the other day.

357
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:41,519
You know how it is,
boss breathing down our necks.

358
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,159
- Bad day all around.
- We're not all windup cops, you know.

359
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,327
I'm finishing my criminology degree 
next month...and applying to the Feds.

360
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,396
My cousin's a G-man.

361
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,124
I could put in a good word
as a professional courtesy.

362
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:54,941
Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?

363
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:58,156
We need some information on a student 
who may have caused you problems.

364
00:18:58,156 --> 00:18:59,989
- Who?
- Joe Templeton.

365
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,370
You make him for the doer
in that rape? / Maybe.

366
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,349
We'd like to pull his records...

367
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,755
but we're having problems getting past 
the gatekeeper in the ivory tower.

368
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:10,331
And you want me to ignore university policy
to help you make your case?

369
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:13,386
We want you
to help us nail a rapist.

370
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:18,886
Off the record,
the guy's a piece of work.

371
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:22,634
In fact, I take more calls on that house
than any other frat on campus.

372
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:23,647
What's his deal?

373
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:26,401
Last semester, a woman on the swim team
claimed he raped her.

374
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:28,103
Why isn't he in our system?

375
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:30,899
She pressed charges through
the university's disciplinary board.

376
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,858
Any details?

377
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:36,130
Templeton got her drunk,
did her while she was in a stupor.

378
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:42,161
- Mandy Schumacher?
- Yes.

379
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:45,296
I'm Detective Munch.
This is my partner, Detective Tutuola.

380
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:47,729
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

381
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,459
It was a rush party.

382
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:53,884
He started hitting on me
the minute I walked in.

383
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:57,251
We danced,
and I had a lot to drink.

384
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:59,982
The only thing I remember
is him on top of me, pulling my hair.

385
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:01,859
I must have blacked out.

386
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,412
Next morning, I woke up with these
God-awful hickeys.

387
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,361
I don't even know
how I got home.

388
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:11,489
If you blacked out,
how did you know you were raped?

389
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,000
I didn't...

390
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,381
until a few weeks later,
when I found out I was pregnant.

391
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,542
I did the math.
It had to be him.

392
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,339
I ended up getting an abortion.
What else could I do?

393
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,544
Why didn't you call the police?

394
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:29,924
I spoke with my advisor
and a lawyer.

395
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,811
Both agreed that I didn't have
much of a case...

396
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:36,012
since there was no evidence,
and I couldn't remember anything.

397
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:38,576
So I filed a complaint
with the review board.

398
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:42,138
They found him guilty
of conduct unbecoming a student.

399
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:45,843
He got put on probation
for one academic semester.

400
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,763
You run into him since?

401
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:51,066
Yeah, we see each other
on campus from time to time.

402
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,468
He even tried to ask me out.

403
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:55,616
I slapped him.

404
00:20:55,616 --> 00:21:00,155
Now he just snickers when he
passes by with his buddies.

405
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:04,873
It's like being raped
all over again.

406
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:09,891
Final labs from Kelly's rape kit.

407
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:12,925
In addition to semen,
the rapist left behind another little gift.

408
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,476
- Gonorrhea.
- The gift that keeps on giving.

409
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:18,368
He either doesn't know
he has it, or doesn't care.

410
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:19,687
How could he not know?

411
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:22,406
Some carriers
don't show obvious symptoms.

412
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,484
Which means he could have
infected others. / Or still may.

413
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,051
We tie Joe to the GHB,
we can arrest him.

414
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:30,496
We got enough
for a search warrant? / Not yet.

415
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,180
But we've got enough to secure
a subpoena for his records.

416
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,038
And if those records
bear out Mandy's testimony...

417
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,575
- that'll give us a search warrant.
- Let's go.

418
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:41,397
I'm sorry, Robert,
I'll call you back.

419
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:42,906
There's your court order...

420
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:45,496
directing you to turn over
any personal, academic...

421
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:49,460
and disciplinary files
for the individuals listed.

422
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,499
You can't just walk in here
and invade their privacy.

423
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:53,798
- They're not even home.
- We can and we are.

424
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:56,969
- Sir, please.
- Get out of our way, squirt.

425
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,364
- Okay, look what we got here.
- Hey.

426
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,837
- Blood stains.
- Didn't bother to change the sheets.

427
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:08,686
Guys...

428
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:10,985
could be the mother lode.

429
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:14,488
I'll take it to the lab,
we'll have an answer in an hour.

430
00:22:15,152 --> 00:22:18,077
- See these graphic representations?
- Yeah.

431
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:21,542
Each color represents a chemical with
a specific refraction rate.

432
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:24,002
The graph on the left shows
the breakdown of the GHB...

433
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:25,998
extracted from
the victim's urine.

434
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:29,662
The graph on the right represents 
the sample taken from the eyedropper.

435
00:22:29,662 --> 00:22:31,881
- What do you see?
- They look the same.

436
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,476
That's because they are.

437
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:36,924
The chemical composition
of the two samples is identical.

438
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:39,590
We find out who made it,
we find out who drugged our victim.

439
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,005
Right. How do you
make this stuff?

440
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:44,003
The GHB tends
to be home-brewed.

441
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:47,369
Often using cleaning solvent
or paint remover as base compounds.

442
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:50,186
But this batch
is uncommonly pure.

443
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:53,026
Whoever cooked it
had access to a lab.

444
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:55,410
Thanks.

445
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:58,031
Joe's been a busy guy.

446
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:01,616
Every one of Mandy's witnesses 
against Joe has a story to tell...

447
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:02,732
none of them flattering.

448
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:06,314
Gets them drunk, lures them
to his room, the hair pulling, the hickeys.

449
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:08,043
It's like he's following
a play book.

450
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:11,387
According to this, he offered up
only two witnesses...in his defense.

451
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:15,304
Hank Ludlow, and his own father,
Joseph Templeton Sr.

452
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:17,897
Now, what's his father doing
at a rush party?

453
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:20,249
Character witness only.

454
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:22,527
Guy must have some heft
with the university.

455
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,069
Here we go.

456
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,745
Mentions a chair he endowed
at the law school.

457
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:28,145
Head of an alumni committee,
overseeing a building fund.

458
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:30,770
No wonder little Joey got off
with a slap on the wrist.

459
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,805
Not this time. Go.

460
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,904
Hank Ludlow...

461
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:40,976
you're under arrest for possession of GHB,
a controlled substance.

462
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:47,903
Joe Templeton...

463
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:49,752
put your hands right there.

464
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:54,635
You're under arrest for possession of GHB
and the rape of Kelly D'leah.

465
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,134
This is ridiculous.

466
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,423
You have the right
to remain silent...

467
00:23:57,423 --> 00:23:59,657
and refuse to answer any questions.
Do you understand?

468
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:02,831
Anything you say can and will be used 
against you in a court of law.

469
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:06,850
You have the right to an attorney. 
If you cannot afford one, one will be...

470
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,552
I demand to see my son.

471
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:17,847
I'm sorry, Mr. Templeton,
but he's in with the detectives right now.

472
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,859
I'm his father.
I have a right to be with him.

473
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,526
He's an adult under the law,

474
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:24,185
and in point of fact, 
you don't have that right.

475
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:25,326
Do you want me
to go over your head?

476
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:28,674
I'm not some college provost
you can intimidate with threats.

477
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:31,444
Now you wanna gun for me, sir,
you give it your best shot.

478
00:24:31,444 --> 00:24:34,679
But it won't help
your son one damn bit.

479
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:45,486
- You have children, Captain?
- No.

480
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:48,737
I just want him to know that
he doesn't have to go through this alone.

481
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,433
Then be there for him.

482
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:53,392
But in the eyes of the law,
Joe is responsible for his own actions...

483
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:57,530
and this time, he's gonna have to stand
on his own two feet.

484
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:04,316
The eyedropper was a cute idea.

485
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:05,705
It's not mine.

486
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:08,194
Then how did it
end up in your waste basket?

487
00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:12,190
- I have no idea.
- And the girl's underwear?

488
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,084
I already told you that
she slept in my bed.

489
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,552
And her blood on your sheets?

490
00:25:17,837 --> 00:25:18,836
I can't help you.

491
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:20,975
The urine sample
you gave already has.

492
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:23,586
It tested positive
for gonorrhea.

493
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,926
What? No.

494
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:29,397
- No, I don't have gonorrhea.
- Yeah. Yeah, you do.

495
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,204
And since Kelly was a virgin
before you raped her...

496
00:25:31,204 --> 00:25:33,981
- we know that she got it from you.
- Circumstantial, at best.

497
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:35,442
It's good enough
for an indictment.

498
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:38,079
And if his DNA matches
the semen from the rape kit...

499
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,978
he'll be transferring to a campus upstate.
You understand that?

500
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:43,157
Assuming you can get
a court order for the blood test.

501
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:46,063
Please. We both know that
that's just a formality.

502
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:47,615
Nevertheless...

503
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:51,735
we'll wait for the results of that formality 
before responding to your charges.

504
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:53,317
Let's go.

505
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:55,195
Possession of GHB is
a schedule one offense.

506
00:25:55,195 --> 00:25:57,832
- With your past record...
- What past record?

507
00:25:57,832 --> 00:26:00,670
The juvie hit for
possession of ecstasy.

508
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:05,013
That record was expunged after my client 
finished his community service.

509
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:08,810
It was expunged on the condition that 
he keep his nose clean until he was 21.

510
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,182
Your client's only 19.

511
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:12,476
We'll start with possession,
move to acting in concert...

512
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:14,186
top it off with rape.

513
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:16,555
- Wait a minute.
- Enough with the scare tactics.

514
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:19,924
- What are you offering?
- What are you selling?

515
00:26:21,736 --> 00:26:24,787
- I never saw the stuff.
- How did it get in your room?

516
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:25,782
I don't know.

517
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:28,350
But Tess and Jodie were
acting weird all night.

518
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:31,863
They kept topping off Kelly's beer,
and calling it a love potion.

519
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:34,297
I thought they were just
trying to get her drunk.

520
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:37,368
Is your roommate in on this?

521
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,255
Yeah.

522
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,589
All I know is...

523
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:44,881
after the girls left...

524
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:47,925
Joe tossed me a blanket
and told me to hit the bricks.

525
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:51,212
Said he was about to hit
another home run.

526
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,727
According to Hank, Joe spent
at least a half hour alone with Kelly...

527
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,519
before he went
downstairs to crash.

528
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,529
His statement also implies a conspiracy 
between Kelly's sorority sisters...

529
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:02,813
for which we have no motive
and no proof.

530
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:05,368
Why would her own sorority sisters
set her up to be raped?

531
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:07,490
Exactly what
the grand jury's gonna ask.

532
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,950
We don't supply an answer,
our whole case looks suspect.

533
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,164
If they are involved...

534
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:14,076
Tess and Jodie are not gonna
be very forthcoming with a motive.

535
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:16,083
But I know someone who might.

536
00:27:18,113 --> 00:27:21,114
Kelly and Tess didn't get along
very well at first.

537
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:23,875
In fact, Tess tried to get
Kelly dinged during pledge week.

538
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,057
"Dinged"?

539
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,679
- Rejected by the membership.
- Why?

540
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:33,763
Look, Dana, I understand
that your sisters are pressuring you...

541
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:36,144
but your friend was
drugged and raped.

542
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:37,816
Now you need to decide
what's more important...

543
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:41,061
living with them,
or living with yourself.

544
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:45,569
Joe and Tess
were dating last semester.

545
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,767
Kelly was new.
She didn't know.

546
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,767
When Joe checked her out
at a rush party, she flirted back.

547
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:53,248
Tess was furious.

548
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:55,215
When Joe dumped her,
she blamed Kelly.

549
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,372
Tess the type of person
to hold a grudge?

550
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:01,572
A few weeks ago,
I heard her and Jodie in the bathroom.

551
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:03,892
Tess found out
she had the clap.

552
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,768
She get it from Joe?

553
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,073
They were whispering.

554
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:09,604
All I heard was something
about getting even.

555
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,701
Things got a little strange after that.

556
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:13,885
She started acting
really friendly towards Kelly.

557
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:16,263
You know, even offered
to be her big sister.

558
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:17,933
But behind her back,
she was spreading rumors...

559
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:20,109
about Kelly and how
she was sleeping around.

560
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:23,396
Tess ever mentioned anything
about drugs? / No.

561
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:26,430
Did you ever see her or Jodie
handling a clear substance...

562
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,194
possibly in an eyedropper?

563
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:32,321
I saw them mixing chemicals
in their room.

564
00:28:33,662 --> 00:28:35,736
When was that?

565
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:37,741
The night before
they went out.

566
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:38,937
It looked like homework.

567
00:28:38,937 --> 00:28:42,034
Tess was reading
from her biochem notebook.

568
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,659
<font color=FF3366HANFORD UNIVERSITY
ORGANIC CHEMISTRY LAB
THURSDAY, JANUARY 11

569
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:50,520
- That's Tess's station.
- Open it.

570
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:56,734
Bag everything.

571
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,314
What are you doing?

572
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:01,776
Lab TA said some items
are missing from storage,

573
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:03,769
we thought they might have been...
misplaced in your drawer here.

574
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:06,283
Perhaps you could 
save us the trouble.

575
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,562
- You been out for a little jog?
- What are you doing in my room?

576
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:18,746
It's all in the warrant.

577
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:21,021
- This is harassment.
- So sue me.

578
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:23,126
You're a biochem major,
aren't you? / So?

579
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:28,644
So, how about educating us to what the 
scientific name for this little formula is?

580
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,202
Well?

581
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:34,547
Tess, possession is
just the beginning.

582
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:37,014
Now we prove conspiracy,
you're looking at rape.

583
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:40,112
Rape? / You took away 
her ability to consent.

584
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,872
- You'll never prove that.
- No?

585
00:29:41,872 --> 00:29:44,977
One of your sorority sisters already 
decided to break the code of silence.

586
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:47,893
Told us how Joe gave you the clap 
before he dumped you for Kelly.

587
00:29:47,893 --> 00:29:50,718
I mean, what better way
to get back at the little tease...

588
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:53,724
than making sure
she paid full freight for the ride?

589
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:56,423
- And GHB was the ticket.
- We traced the chemicals...

590
00:29:56,423 --> 00:29:57,985
we know where
you mixed them.

591
00:29:57,985 --> 00:30:00,091
All we have to do is execute
another search warrant...

592
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,710
and we're gonna have more than
what we need...

593
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,042
to put you and your accomplice
away for a very long time.

594
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:10,043
- I better call a lawyer.
- Be my guest.

595
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,861
You think she'll take the bait?

596
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:28,076
We'll know soon enough.

597
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,342
Okay.

598
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:02,626
You bitch.

599
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:09,034
Prison is no sorority, Jodie.

600
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,162
On the bright side,
you still might be young enough...

601
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,979
- to have kids when you get out.
- You don't scare me.

602
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:18,335
What if I told you we have
enough evidence to send you to prison?

603
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,027
My father would
never let that happen.

604
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:23,557
Your fingerprints on the eyedropper. 
Daddy can't help you with that.

605
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:26,410
Look, Jodie,
I was in a sorority, too.

606
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,334
I understand that the bonds
of sisterhood run very deep.

607
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:32,544
But Tess sold you out.

608
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:33,885
She would never do that.

609
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:36,109
She made a phone call
that put you in the basement.

610
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:38,457
We know she was the one
who had the beef with Kelly.

611
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:41,821
- You just did the dirty work for her.
- Look...

612
00:31:41,821 --> 00:31:43,367
you tell us the truth...

613
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:46,626
and we'll try to convince the DA to take 
your cooperation into consideration.

614
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:48,722
You don't know Tess.

615
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:50,779
If she did that to Kelly...

616
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:54,342
I'm James Woodrow,
Miss Tomlinson's lawyer

617
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:57,468
Her father, Justice Tomlinson,
sends his regards.

618
00:31:57,468 --> 00:32:00,446
And meanwhile, my client is invoking
her constitutional right...

619
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:03,044
to keep her mouth shut.

620
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,950
Jodie's lawyer
has pulled the plug.

621
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,843
I think he'll reconsider,
once he and her father see the evidence.

622
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:14,238
At least we've got them on possession, 
possibly rape three, acting in concert.

623
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:15,226
Now the bad news.

624
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:18,425
Joe's and Hank's DNA don't match 
the semen from the rape kit.

625
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:21,918
- Are you sure?
- Lab checked it twice.

626
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:24,691
So we got a rape,
but we still don't have a rapist.

627
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:27,001
What about Joe?
Doesn't the clap implicate him?

628
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:30,213
Gonorrhea cannot be genetically traced.
So without the DNA...

629
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:31,856
This is interesting.

630
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:34,354
Remember that ugly scarf
with all the little fish on it?

631
00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:35,980
The one they found
in the bushes?

632
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,868
Lab lifted two distinct
hair fibers from it.

633
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:41,058
One belongs to Kelly,
the other matches the semen.

634
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:44,249
Looks familiar.

635
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:45,731
We found it where you fell.

636
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,662
There were hairs on it
belonging to you and another person.

637
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:51,288
- The guy who raped me?
- That's what we believe.

638
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:55,584
Think hard, Kelly.
This is a very unusual scarf.

639
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,382
You frat boys
and your nicknames.

640
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,203
Walleye. That's a kind
of fish, isn't it?

641
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:20,437
That wasn't a very bright move,
giving Kelly your scarf.

642
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:22,940
- I didn't.
- You saying she stole it?

643
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,147
She must have.

644
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:27,374
- From where?
- I don't know.

645
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:28,641
You don't know
where you keep your clothes?

646
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,791
I don't know how she got it.

647
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:33,131
Why don't we try and figure that one out? 
You said you were in Joe's room.

648
00:33:33,131 --> 00:33:37,037
- I left to study.
- I meant later...

649
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:39,613
when you found Kelly alone.

650
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:45,049
Like I said, I offered to walk her home,
but she left without me.

651
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:57,503
The hair fibers on the scarf,
match the semen that you left on Kelly.

652
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:02,522
Why'd you lie, Wally?

653
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:12,123
When I saw her sitting there...

654
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:14,921
she looked so sad.

655
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,335
I took her to my room...

656
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:21,787
and I brushed the hair
back from her face.

657
00:34:21,787 --> 00:34:24,882
And for the first time...

658
00:34:24,882 --> 00:34:30,599
she looked at me
like she actually saw me.

659
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:34,587
And we sat on my bed...

660
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:37,304
and talked...

661
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:41,213
and then she kissed me.

662
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:47,110
And...
the rest just happened.

663
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,699
I didn't know she was drugged.

664
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:54,486
I thought she wanted
to be with me.

665
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:01,174
It doesn't matter if Wally knew,
it's rape by statute.

666
00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:03,090
Could we offer him a deal?

667
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,219
His DNA is the only concrete
evidence we have linking rapist to victim.

668
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:10,579
I can't afford to compromise my case 
against the others by dealing him out.

669
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:12,892
Yet, somehow that
does not seem right.

670
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:15,254
The kid goes down
because he misread signals?

671
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:18,357
If we offer him a deal,
we send mixed signals to the grand jury.

672
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:20,601
I can't ask them to indict
the sorority sisters on rape...

673
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:22,237
without offering up a rapist.

674
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:25,455
- The case against Joe that shaky?
- It's circumstantial.

675
00:35:25,455 --> 00:35:26,985
By itself, it's probably not enough

676
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:28,994
to secure an indictment...
for acting in concert.

677
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:32,238
You mean, after all this,
there's a chance Joe could walk?

678
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:35,188
Which is why we can't afford
to lose Wally as a defendant.

679
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:37,036
If we can secure indictments
across the board...

680
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:39,274
I might be in a position
to offer him a lesser charge...

681
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:41,994
in exchange for his testimony.

682
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:48,455
<font color=FF3366GRAND JURY ROOM
FRIDAY, JANUARY 19

683
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:49,949
I'm nervous.

684
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:52,260
You're gonna do fine.
Just listen to Alex.

685
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,613
She'll guide you through
the testimony, step by step.

686
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,279
Will any of them
be in the room?

687
00:35:57,279 --> 00:36:00,653
No. Just you, Alex,
and the grand jury.

688
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:04,516
- I hope I'm doing the right thing.
- Kelly, you are.

689
00:36:04,516 --> 00:36:07,199
I still can't remember anything.
What if they don't believe me?

690
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,741
Just tell them what you know.

691
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:11,120
The other witnesses
will tell them the rest.

692
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,578
Ready?

693
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:17,590
Kelly?

694
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,014
I thought you said
they wouldn't be here.

695
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:23,088
They won't be inside.
I promise.

696
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:28,375
I was lying on my back
in the hospital, shaking.

697
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:31,522
The doctor told me...

698
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,091
I'd been raped.

699
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:37,599
I was scared.

700
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,066
It's like someone stealing
a piece of your soul.

701
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:44,644
And even when you find out
who, and how...

702
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:46,904
you can never get it back.

703
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,109
I may not remember
that night...

704
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:54,855
but I do remember
my life before it...

705
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:59,656
and I'll never be
that person again.

706
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:02,089
GHB acts as an intoxicant...

707
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:06,253
depressing one's inhibitions
and making one extremely pliable.

708
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:08,085
Does the drug affect
one's memory?

709
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:12,123
In nearly all cases, the victim suffers
permanent short-term amnesia.

710
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:15,305
We found a notebook
belonging to Tess Michner.

711
00:37:15,305 --> 00:37:19,131
Underneath the heading
"Love potion," was a formula for GHB...

712
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:24,143
which exactly matched the GHB
found in Kelly D'leah's blood.

713
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:26,434
Now, a few days later...

714
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:29,204
base chemicals were discovered
in the sorority basement...

715
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:32,011
and fingerprints
subsequently tied...

716
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:35,705
Tess Michner and Jodie Tomlinson
to the containers.

717
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:38,565
I saw Tess and Jodie
mixing chemicals...

718
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:41,791
in their bedroom the night
before they went out with Kelly.

719
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,862
- What were they mixing?
- I don't know.

720
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,041
But they called it
a love potion.

721
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,894
They kept laughing and filling
Kelly's glass.

722
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:53,792
Did Joe say anything to you
when he sent you from the room?

723
00:37:54,546 --> 00:37:57,006
That he was going
to hit a home run.

724
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,936
And who was in the room
when you left?

725
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:03,599
Just Joe and Kelly.

726
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,908
The examination revealed a torn hymen, 
semen, and the presence of gonorrhea.

727
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:10,483
Can gonorrhea be transmitted
without leaving semen?

728
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:13,246
Yes, if the individual penetrates
without ejaculating.

729
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:16,626
DNA analysis matched
the semen to Wallace Parker.

730
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:19,271
However, that semen was free
of gonorrhea.

731
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:21,423
What does that
suggest to you, doctor?

732
00:38:21,423 --> 00:38:24,027
Someone else
infected Kelly D'leah.

733
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:26,916
We discovered underwear
stuffed between Joe's bed and wall.

734
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,547
Blood spots on his sheets
also belonged to Kelly D'leah.

735
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:32,656
The crime lab analyzed
a sample of Joe Templeton's urine.

736
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:37,055
- What did they report?
- He was infected with gonorrhea.

737
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:40,631
How we doing?

738
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:44,102
About as well as could be expected.
How are you holding up?

739
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:46,102
All right, I guess.

740
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:48,049
You wanted to see us?

741
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:51,099
Wally's lawyer served us
with a cross 190.50.

742
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,178
What's that?

743
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:53,935
It means that Wally is
exercising his right

744
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:56,192
to testify in front
of a grand jury.

745
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:58,457
- What's he have to say?
- I don't know.

746
00:38:58,457 --> 00:39:01,064
I was hoping
you could tell me.

747
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:03,462
I told you,
I don't remember anything.

748
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:05,833
I don't think Wally's lawyer would risk
a grand jury appearance...

749
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,415
if he didn't think his client
could be persuasive in an argument.

750
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:11,058
A DNA match
will make anyone desperate.

751
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,963
Unless there's
a mitigating explanation.

752
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:15,883
Can you think of anything
that might have happened that night...

753
00:39:15,883 --> 00:39:18,385
to lead Wally to believe
his advances were welcomed?

754
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:20,385
Anything that might be
construed as consent?

755
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:24,725
- I can't remember.
- Okay, what about before that night?

756
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:26,265
Think hard, Kelly.

757
00:39:26,265 --> 00:39:30,143
Did you ever flirt with him
even just a little? / No.

758
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:35,247
Well, maybe.

759
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,410
Tell me.

760
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,761
We had a couple classes together.

761
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:41,327
He was a whiz
at the classics...

762
00:39:41,327 --> 00:39:45,281
so I invited him for coffee a few times 
afterward just to pick his brain.

763
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:47,778
You know... And yes, 
I knew he had a crush on me...

764
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:51,410
but I never...What? 
That doesn't mean I'm a slut.

765
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,533
Kelly, we know.

766
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:56,352
It's just, it might give them the ammunition 
they need to plead innocent.

767
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,340
I knew I shouldn't have
gone through with this.

768
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,023
- Okay. So what can you do?
- Well...

769
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:06,211
after he makes his statement,
I get to cross examine him.

770
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:09,337
Don't worry,
I'll go after him.

771
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:11,763
<font color=FF3366GRAND JURY ROOM
FRIDAY, JANUARY 19

772
00:40:11,763 --> 00:40:13,639
It began as a friendship...

773
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:16,715
and became something more,
that night.

774
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,849
We had sex.

775
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,587
But I didn't know she was drugged.
I swear, I didn't know

776
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:29,331
Mr. Parker, just a couple of questions
for clarification.

777
00:40:30,062 --> 00:40:34,535
You saw the vomit
on the floor. / Yes.

778
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,452
You saw her
disheveled appearance. / Yes.

779
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:40,961
Her matted hair,
the watering eyes. / Yes.

780
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:43,180
And you still didn't know
she was under the influence...

781
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,654
- when you asked her into your room?
- I thought she was tired.

782
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:50,308
- Tired?
- Upset, maybe.

783
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:52,228
She looked sad.

784
00:40:52,228 --> 00:40:55,260
And you took that as
an invitation to have sex?

785
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,123
No, I mean...

786
00:40:57,123 --> 00:41:00,360
Did she say she wanted
to have sex with you?

787
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:03,553
- She flirted with me.
- When?

788
00:41:03,553 --> 00:41:06,271
In class, at the coffee shop.

789
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:09,913
Did she say she wanted to
have sex with you then?

790
00:41:09,913 --> 00:41:12,678
No. / Did she say she
wanted to have sex with you...

791
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:17,377
the night that you took her
into your room? / She didn't have to.

792
00:41:17,377 --> 00:41:19,493
I'll take that as a no.

793
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,493
She kissed me.

794
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:25,582
And you took that kiss
as the green light to go ahead?

795
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,268
She never said no.

796
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,425
Her shirt was stained
with vomit...

797
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:32,360
her hair was matted,
her eyes were blurry...

798
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,828
and you still thought
she wanted to have sex?

799
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:38,149
Yes.

800
00:41:38,149 --> 00:41:41,513
I guess it was just
your lucky night.

801
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:48,812
What is taking so long?

802
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:50,533
Don't read too much into it.

803
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:52,414
They have a lot of evidence
to sift through...

804
00:41:52,414 --> 00:41:55,169
a lot of testimony
to consider.

805
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:13,816
Hey.

806
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:15,213
So?

807
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:19,158
The grand jury indicted Tess
and Jodie on possession...

808
00:42:19,727 --> 00:42:23,312
but they didn't return charges
against Wally or Joe.

809
00:42:23,312 --> 00:42:25,533
They're saying I wasn't raped?

810
00:42:25,533 --> 00:42:28,722
But what about the semen,
the gonorrhea, the hickeys?

811
00:42:28,722 --> 00:42:32,396
Apparently, the grand jury
split on the issue of consent...

812
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:34,323
they believed that
you were drugged,

813
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:37,121
but they didn't
believe that the guys knew.

814
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,921
On the other hand,
the dean expelled them all.

815
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:45,531
Hardly seems worth it.

816
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:49,564
Kelly, you did
the right thing.

817
00:42:52,013 --> 00:42:54,653
I never took those pills
the doctor gave me.

818
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:57,697
I don't know why,
but I just... I couldn't.

819
00:42:57,697 --> 00:43:00,427
What if I'm pregnant?

820
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,932
I'm probably not
the best person to ask.

821
00:43:04,932 --> 00:43:08,019
What about my parents?

822
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:11,980
I haven't told them yet.

823
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:17,943
Might be a good time, huh?

824
00:43:20,612 --> 00:43:22,824
