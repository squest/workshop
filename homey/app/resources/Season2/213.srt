7
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,415
- You see anything?
- Just the body.

8
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,283
Thomas Marchek, pedophile.

9
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,952
- You say Marchek?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,354
You know the guy?

11
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,056
He raped a
seven-year-old girl.

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,091
Left her cut up and
unconscious in a drainpipe.

13
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,492
Yeah, I know.

14
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,928
And how are you so tuned in?

15
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,730
I'm just doing my job.

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,519
All right. Sir, did you
touch the body?

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,101
- I know better.
- Not even to check for vitals?

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,954
Shorteye's head was
practically blown off.

19
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:11,687
Look, if you want to talk to me,

20
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:14,074
here's a card with my numbers...

21
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,802
home and work.

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,206
It's nice to meet you.

23
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,683
Five years ago,
I put this guy away.

24
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,784
You SVU?

25
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,853
Yeah, Benson, Stabler.
Who called us?

26
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,355
You got three shots,
point blank to the face.

27
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,857
Nine mil.

28
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,927
Wouldn't be surprised if the slugs
turn out to be hollow point.

29
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,763
- Made quite a statement.
- And a mess.

30
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,365
Now, why'd you call us in?
This is a homicide.

31
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,668
Chief of Detective
reassigned by request.

32
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,037
You sent the guy up.
I guess that's why you're catching.

33
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,705
This is a dead ex-con.

34
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,007
This is not a victim
of a sex crime. Was he raped?

35
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,043
Do his wounds suggest
anything sexual in nature?

36
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,313
I feel for you, pal,
but this comes from above.

37
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,714
Your problem's not with me.

38
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,316
Who made the request?

39
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,909
A Captain Cragen.

40
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,452
Elliot, give him a chance
to explain.

41
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,055
Why?

42
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,766
Excuse me?

43
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,535
Thomas Marchek kidnapped
Corrine Branson...

44
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,904
tortured her at knifepoint,
and left her for dead.

45
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,005
I read the file.

46
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,707
I was ready to cap
that dirtbag myself.

47
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,442
Now you expect me to
work his homicide?

48
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,477
One Police Plaza does.

49
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,002
They asked me to take it,
I said "yes".

50
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,718
To polish your political apple?

51
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,420
It's delicate territory
and you're familiar with the players.

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,389
- I'll fill Homicide in.
- You go talk to the parents.

53
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,092
I'll talk to the parents and tell them
the good news about Marchek.

54
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,927
But I am not telling them
that they're suspects.

55
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,363
According to the Chief,
the girl's mother threatened Marchek...

56
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,497
at the last parole hearing.

57
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,266
She should've threatened
the Parole Board...

58
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,063
Are you finished?

59
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,742
I don't want this case.

60
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,643
I'm through explaining myself
to you. You caught it, you make it.

74
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,401
I begged the Parole Board
to keep him in prison...

75
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,803
but they wouldn't listen.

76
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,035
Lindsay, why didn't you call me?

77
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,673
You know I would
have testified for you.

78
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,675
I thought it was
just a formality.

79
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,578
I never dreamed they would
actually let him out.

80
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,947
We don't want to cause you
any more heartache.

81
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,583
- But I have to ask you.
- I'm a suspect.

82
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,119
You threatened to kill him.

83
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,687
I was angry.

84
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,485
- Can you blame me?
- No.

85
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,821
Where were you last night?

86
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,666
Right here with my child.
I won't let her out of my sight.

87
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,935
And your husband?

88
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,937
We're divorced.

89
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,406
Where does he live now?

90
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,375
I don't believe you people.

91
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,900
Haven't we been through enough?

92
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,616
Hi Corrine. It's me, Elliot.

93
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,344
Do you remember?

94
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,712
I almost didn't recognize you.
It's been so long. You've grown a lot.

95
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,127
How've you been?

96
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,266
I remember you.

97
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,256
You caught that man.

98
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,062
Yes.

99
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,600
Thank you.

100
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,767
You never have to
thank me for that.

101
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,918
Why aren't you at school?

102
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,546
I have school here.
My mom teaches me.

103
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,924
Why?

104
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,261
I don't like it when
people look at me.

105
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,058
I'm ugly.

106
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,956
That's not true.

107
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,045
Yes it is.

109
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,881
It's a shame about Marchek.

110
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,184
He was a good driver.
He never tried to skip his shift.

111
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,486
- You know him well?
- Not to speak of.

112
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,154
We drove together
a couple of times.

113
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,124
- What'd you talk about?
- Usual stuff.

114
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,560
Women troubles, sports...

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,929
how the union ain't
what it used to be.

116
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,697
Marchek had problems
with women?

117
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,567
Yeah, some ex of his
was stalking him.

118
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,435
He said he had a bad break-up.

119
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,938
He was with a new one
and the old one couldn't let go.

120
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,691
You ever see his former lady?

121
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:14,941
Yeah, hanging around
once or twice.

122
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,944
Man, I told him to call the
cops, but he said it wasn't worth it.

123
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,146
Would you recognize her
if you saw her again?

124
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,516
Blonde, little over 5'.

125
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,951
Drove a light blue Honda.

126
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,794
She's kind of old for him, though.

127
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,254
Maybe that's why
he couldn't shake her.

128
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,456
Did he mention a more
recent girlfriend?

129
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,760
Yeah, Gloria something.

130
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,961
Check with the office.

131
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,197
Marchek said he didn't have family,
so she's probably his emergency notify.

132
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,766
Thanks.

133
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,268
Gloria, how long were you
and Thomas Marchek dating?

134
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,936
About four months.

135
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,240
We were already talking
about marriage, kids.

136
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,374
Can't this wait?

137
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,843
When was the last time
you saw him?

138
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,445
Night before last.

139
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,847
- What about last night?
- I was working.

140
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,950
- Where?
- Club Devinyl on 34th Street.

141
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,485
I get off around 3:00.

142
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,121
Tommy had left for work
by the time I got home.

143
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,714
He ever talk about
his ex-girlfriend?

144
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,293
I didn't know he had one.

145
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,430
He mention anyone following
him? Maybe giving him a hard time?

146
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,033
Yeah, there was this one guy.
Said he was with the Citizen Watch.

147
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,035
Put up flyers with Tommy's
picture on it.

148
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,404
He even followed us into
a restaurant and harassed us.

149
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,263
And you are?

150
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:21,474
Louise Durning.
I am a friend of Gloria's

151
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,243
And I have witnessed the abuse
they've had to endure.

152
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,311
What kind of abuse?

153
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,347
He called Tommy names and
called me worse for being with him.

154
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,083
They couldn't go out
without being assaulted by this man...

155
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,286
or one of his storm troopers.

156
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,822
Nobody saw the good
in Tommy but me.

157
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,187
You know what he did?

158
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,959
He changed.

159
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,154
It didn't bother you?

160
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,363
I loved him.

161
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,013
Can't you see she's in enough pain?

162
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:48,434
Where's your compassion,
for God's sake?

163
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,767
With the little girl Tommy
raped and cut.

165
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,448
You got to be kidding.

166
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,347
Mr. Branson, just answer the question.

167
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,419
I was in Chicago on business.

168
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,634
You want the receipts?
I can prove it.

169
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,222
No, that won't be necessary.

170
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,556
Actually, it is.

171
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,058
You of all people.

172
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,322
Trust me, I don't like this
any better than you do.

173
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,498
Thank you.

174
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,263
- You talk to Lindsay, Corrine?
- Yes.

175
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,136
How're they doing?

176
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,706
Your daughter seems lonely.
Do you get to see her often?

177
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,941
Not as often as I should.

178
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,843
I can't take Lindsay
blaming me anymore.

179
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,334
Josh, it's not your fault.

180
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,749
When that monster Marchek
raped my little girl,

181
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,653
he killed a part of me.

182
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,022
Your daughter is
still alive...

183
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,924
and she misses you very much.

184
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,959
Her mother won't let me near her.

185
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,095
She says they don't get
out very often.

186
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,460
She shut herself off.

187
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,580
I've tried to talk to her.
I even bought her a car,

188
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,672
hoping she'd take Corrine to
the country where she can...

189
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,640
play outside and feel safe.

190
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,040
- What kind of car?
- An Accord.

191
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,440
Why?

192
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,485
Does Lindsay take Corrine with
her when she goes out to run errands?

193
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:16,155
No, the neighbor across
the hall stays with her.

194
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,492
A sweet lady
named Virginia Koehler.

195
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,160
You think Lindsay
killed the bastard?

196
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,763
We don't think anything,
Mrs. Koehler. We're talking to everyone.

197
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,299
You take care of Corrine when
her mother is out. Is that correct?

198
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,734
I'm one of the only people
she trusts.

199
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,270
After the terrible thing that happened,
she's very careful.

200
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,506
- You baby-sit Corrine last night?
- Why?

201
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,442
Mrs. Koehler, do you think Lindsay
murdered her daughter's attacker?

202
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,678
- No.
- Then tell us the truth.

203
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,738
Did you stay with Corrine
last night?

204
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,586
Yes.

205
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,254
Lindsay went to the
grocery store.

206
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,523
And what time did she return?

207
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,513
About 11:00.

208
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,895
She's all that little girl has.

209
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,260
Please leave her alone.

210
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,237
The DMV lists Lindsay Branson
as the owner of a '98 blue Honda Accord.

211
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,706
No tickets. No warrants.

212
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,140
Any registered weapons?

213
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,014
A Smith and Wesson 9mm
registered to Josh Branson,

214
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:13,312
but not to the ex-wife.

215
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,143
Pick her up.

216
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,148
Okay, why are we doing this, now?

217
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,165
The gun is registered to
the husband.

218
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:20,152
They're divorced.
They live apart.

219
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,754
I want her in a line-up.

220
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,205
If Marchek's co-worker can ID
Mrs. Branson as the stalker,

221
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,491
then we'll play it out.

222
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,293
This is based on
circumstantial evidence.

223
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,395
We've twisted suspects
in the wind for a lot less...

224
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,896
than what we've got on
paper right now.

225
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,798
Those suspects...

226
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,369
didn't have a daughter who
was raped and had her face sliced up.

227
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,471
She clears the line-up,
she goes home.

228
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,672
I'm not doing this.

229
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,540
- Elliot.
- No. You know something...

230
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,276
this woman's already
living in hell.

231
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,047
And now you're asking me
to drag her in like a criminal.

232
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,349
- I'm not doing it.
- This isn't your call, Detective.

233
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,319
Counselor, you know something,
I don't answer to you.

234
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,588
You answer to me.

235
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,502
And I suggest you adjust
your attitude before

236
00:10:57,502 --> 00:11:00,422
I write you up on insubordination.

237
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,491
I just don't think 
we have enough evidence.

238
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:13,205
I say we do.

239
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,798
Either get right with that 
or go home.

240
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:37,596
Can you identify the woman who was
following Tommy Marchek?

241
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,198
Number three. That's her.

242
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,800
Take your time.

243
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,202
What for? It's number three.

244
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,105
Can I go now? I got a lot
of deliveries to get out.

245
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,697
Yeah.

246
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,144
Search warrants were issued
for the premises and the car?

247
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,913
Munch and Fin are on it.

248
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,915
Are you gonna be able to
do the interrogation...

249
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,117
or do I need to get
another set of detectives?

250
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,244
It's not a problem.

251
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,794
Can I get you anything?

252
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,283
No.

253
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,898
- Do you understand your rights?
- Yes.

254
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,766
Do you want a lawyer?

255
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,942
Lindsay, I really think you should
have a lawyer present.

256
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,807
I'm glad he's dead.

257
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,646
I thought I'd have some closure...

258
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:28,881
but it hasn't made a difference.

259
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:33,681
Corrine is still afraid to go out and
then my family is still in shambles.

260
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,357
Did you follow Mr. Marchek?

261
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,426
Yes.

262
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,247
To his home, his job,

263
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,730
even to his girlfriend's
apartment on Lexington.

264
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,893
Then each time I saw his face,
I saw him raping my little girl.

265
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,696
How long had you been stalking him?

266
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,344
Since the day he got out of prison,
I've dreamed of his death.

267
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:02,905
What I would do to him.
How I would make him suffer!

268
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,084
Tell me what happened last night.

269
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,825
I followed him...

270
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,894
from, um...

271
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:19,296
from the meat market to some bar
in Alphabet City.

272
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,068
And I waited for him outside.

273
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,204
And did you have a gun?

274
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,606
I had my husband's.

275
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:31,633
I followed him for several blocks on foot...

276
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,608
his back made a perfect target.

277
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,445
But I couldn't do it.

278
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:46,125
Every night I had the chance
and I just, I couldn't do it.

279
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,028
And then somebody else did it for me.

280
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,830
Yeah.

281
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,032
- I don't have a confession.
- You don't need one.

282
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,513
Police. Step aside. Thank you.

283
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

284
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,956
Olivia, I'd like you to meet
a recent parolee and rapist...

285
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,791
Craig Moss, 
three shots to the head.

286
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,260
- If Cragen finds out I called you...
- I got it off the scanner.

287
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,126
- What's the deal here?
- Check out this flyer.

288
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,233
That's him. Second guy.

289
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,202
Same MO, 9mm, hollow-point slugs.

290
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,571
Guess that lets Lindsay off the hook.

291
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,437
Puts us on the trail of 
a serial killer.

292
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,950
- Did he suffer?
- No, it was quick.

293
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,010
But not quick enough, 
right, Detective?

294
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,157
Your son was murdered.

295
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,493
We're trying to find out who did it.

296
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,291
- What do you care?
- It's our job.

297
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,531
And my cross to bear.

298
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:03,168
- Mrs. Moss, this isn't about you.
- No?

299
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,331
If my son hadn't been born,
those two women never would've been raped.

300
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,672
I ask myself what I did wrong
and have no answers.

301
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:18,450
Did your son mention anything about
having trouble with anyone lately?

302
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,087
There were sex offender flyers
all over the neighborhood...

303
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,124
obscenities spray-painted 
on my door and...

304
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,593
the man who beat him 
to a pulp last week.

305
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,561
Did your son tell you 
who this man was?

306
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,664
No, but I can guess.

307
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,934
The owner of the corner market, Pulham.

308
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
He hated Craig.

309
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,337
Had half-a-dozen flyers
pasted in the store window.

310
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,542
I hated what he did...

311
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,634
but I loved my son.

312
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,975
He did his time...

313
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,574
was raped in prison and got HIV.

314
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,614
He suffered, too.

315
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,559
My brother-in-law said to expect you.

316
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,710
Your brother-in-law?

317
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,696
Yeah, he's a patrol cop in Queens.

318
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,664
Figured my little run-in
with Craig the pervert...

319
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,166
would put me at the top of your list.

320
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,668
According to Moss' mother,
you beat the hell out of him.

321
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,704
I kicked him out of my store.

322
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,405
And kept kicking?

323
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,974
He's a rapist.

324
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,463
Was.

325
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,080
Look, I caught him checking out a couple
of teenage girls who came in for sodas.

326
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,149
What am I supposed to do,
wait for him to rape them, too?

327
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,585
Where were you last night
between 8:00 and 10:00?

328
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,720
Right here.

329
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,221
I'm open till 11:00 every night.

330
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,523
And I got plenty of customers
who'll vouch for that.

331
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,393
Who enlightened you about
Mr. Moss' background?

332
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,462
A Citizen Watch guy came in here 
with a flyer...

333
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,330
Asking me to post them on my window.

334
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,965
I asked for extras.

335
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,868
He said this guy Moss
raped a mother of four.

336
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,371
Predators like him, they never stop.

337
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,974
I run a family business.
This kind of scum ain't welcome here.

338
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,977
You have any idea where we might
be able to find this Citizen Watch guy?

339
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,347
Yeah, sure, they rent a space in
the Rec Center, couple of blocks down.

340
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,681
They do a good job, too.
I haven't had a break-in in two years.

341
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,160
Hello, Detectives, good to see you again.

342
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,525
This is not a social visit.

343
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,899
We'd like you to stop
distributing these flyers.

344
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,534
We're not breaking any laws.

345
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,202
That remains to be seen.

346
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,538
Mr. Pulham assaulted a man 
on your flyer.

347
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,940
And now two of them are dead.

348
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,609
I'm sorry to hear that.

349
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,178
We only try to inform and prevent.

350
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,348
You're inciting people to break the law.
To commit murder.

351
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,383
- That's a long reach, isn't it?
- Is it?

352
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,218
We've got two dead men...

353
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,887
Flyers that you've distributed...

354
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,457
and Citizen Watch members
at both crime scenes.

355
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,792
Are we suspects?

356
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,762
We'd like a list of your members,
names, addresses, phone numbers, please.

357
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,631
You know, we're only 
protecting ourselves

358
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,567
against these rapists 
because you won't.

359
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,670
The system puts them in our
neighborhoods and then turns its back.

360
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,806
And where exactly would you 
like them to go?

361
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,001
Hell's good and hot.

362
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,641
Thank you.

363
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,522
The Chief's idea of a joke?

364
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,991
Much as I hate it,
there's nothing we can do.

365
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,060
Protecting rapists now.

366
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,895
To shield us from lawsuits...

367
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,558
and to keep anyone else on
that flyer from being murdered.

368
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,735
Now the remaining two parolees 
on the list...

369
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,039
Trent Wills and James Campbell,
are to get round-the-clock protection.

370
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,640
Captain, what are we supposed to do...

371
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,576
about the honest, hard-working
people who actually need us?

372
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,784
These men have rights and we have
jobs to do. Anything else?

373
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,153
Ballistics came back
on Lindsay Branson's gun.

374
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,221
No match.

375
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,057
But we're looking at the same
9mm for both stiffs.

376
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,360
And we're running background checks
on all the Citizen Watch members.

377
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,797
Well, this guy Winfield 
sounds especially ripe.

378
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,900
Talk to the two parolees. See if any
of these "concerned citizens"...

379
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,336
were keeping too close a watch
on either one of them.

380
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,504
We'll take Wills.

381
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,439
And we'll take the other one.

382
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,133
Elliot?

383
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,978
- How far you gonna push this?
- Captain.

384
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,514
No, since I assigned this case...

385
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,717
you have questioned my orders
and disrespected my command.

386
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,119
Now, I've cut you some slack
because of our relationship...

387
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,990
but this well is running pretty dry.
Are we clear?

388
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,691
Yes, sir.

389
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,994
I get enough crap from the politicians.

390
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,364
I don't need any from my own detectives.

391
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,666
I need a break, Elliot.

392
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,724
Find me one.

394
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,378
Police protection. Does this mean
I get a ride to work?

395
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,013
No.

396
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,149
Anybody been stalking you?
Giving you attitude?

397
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,151
Yeah.

398
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,720
Two fat, ugly, old broads
with matching windbreakers.

399
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,624
I doubled back and spooked
the hell out of them.

400
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,394
A fun time was had by all.

401
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,329
Did you get their names?

402
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,697
Yeah.

403
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,401
Fat and Fatter, Winfield's little army.

404
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,597
Any babes in this police detail?

405
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,911
Been a long time. 
Getting kind of anxious.

406
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,948
Watch me, Daddy!

407
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,521
Your mother-in-law said 
we'd find you here.

408
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,957
We try to live as normally as possible...

409
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,759
but that watch group is making
our lives miserable.

410
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,563
After they put me on that flyer,
my boss fired me.

411
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,565
Didn't want a pervert selling insurance.

412
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,130
Can you blame them for being afraid?

413
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,568
I'm not a danger to anybody.

414
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,161
Would Sandra Woodly agree?

415
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,275
I was 22. I met her in a club.

416
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,111
I wasn't thinking a 15-year-old
could even be out that late.

417
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,180
- She said she was 19.
- Was that your defense?

418
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,250
Look, I didn't deny any of it,
I went to prison.

419
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,451
What more can I do?

420
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,386
A protective detail will begin at midnight...

421
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,956
and continue around-the-clock
until the killer is found.

422
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,558
You're saying that we're at risk?

423
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,961
Look, you're on the flyer, just like
the other two rapists who were killed.

424
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,062
So?

425
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,398
Has anyone from the watch group
been harassing you?

426
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,033
Sam Winfield.

427
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:12,404
He even tried to stop me from enrolling
my daughter in his kid's school.

428
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,207
Who the hell does he think he is?

429
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,508
All roads lead to Winfield.

430
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,945
- Who is this guy?
- An ex-cop from Albany.

431
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,180
He took an early retirement 
after a bad shoot.

432
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,348
It doesn't prove anything.

433
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,852
But I had a heart-to-heart with
his partner at the time of that bad shoot.

434
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,153
It involved a rapist.

435
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,923
He also has an arsenal of 
weapons registered...

436
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,625
including a 9mm.

437
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,496
Marchek's girlfriend said a man from
the Citizen Watch was harassing them.

438
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,931
And her friend said it got pretty heated.

439
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,433
Show them both the photo array.

440
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,232
If they can ID him, let's invite him
down here for a little chat.

442
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,008
There you go. She's doing so well.

443
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,176
She's a brave little girl.

444
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,478
- Thank you.
- I'll see you next week.

445
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,014
- Louise Durning?
- Yes?

446
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,251
I'm Detective Benson.
This is my partner, Detective Stabler.

447
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:02,220
You're here about Gloria?

448
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,187
Come this way.

449
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,794
We understand you were with
Gloria and Thomas Marchek...

450
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,563
when a man from Citizen
Watch approached you.

451
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,265
Yes. In the restaurant.

452
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,567
Do you think you'd remember this man
if you saw him again?

453
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,835
I think so.

454
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,138
Okay, can you tell us if he's one of these?

455
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,707
Yes, he's this one.

456
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,909
Do you think he had something
to do with Thomas' murder?

457
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,678
Do you remember what he said 
in the restaurant?

458
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,347
Nothing to me.

459
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,351
He showed Thomas his gun
and told him to watch out.

460
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,686
I already gave a statement.
What more do you need?

461
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,855
You said Sam Winfield,
the guy from the community watch...

462
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,256
harassed you and Tommy.

463
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,458
He followed us everywhere.

464
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,794
Even came in here a couple of times,
went straight to Glo's station.

465
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,997
I tried to avoid him, but he complained
to my manager. I had to wait on him.

466
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,967
- Did he say anything?
- Awful stuff about Tommy.

467
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,270
He said if I knew what was good for me,
I'd leave him and never see him again.

468
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,773
One time Tommy came in
and he was talking to Glo...

469
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,842
I thought for sure there was
gonna be hell to pay.

470
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,681
What happened?

471
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:59,244
Tommy grabbed Winfield by the shirt

472
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,679
lifted him right out of his chair.

473
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,782
Winfield split Tommy's head
open with an ashtray.

474
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,308
Said if he ever touched
him again, he'd kill him.

475
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,955
Finally caught up with Gloria.

476
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,656
She ID'd Winfield from the array...

477
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,859
and confirmed that he
threatened Marchek with a gun.

478
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,827
Now she's scared for her life.

479
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:19,431
At the rate this guy's going, we're gonna
have to assign another protection detail.

480
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,035
Dispatch just got a call from
the Campbell residence.

481
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:26,104
Shots fired.

482
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,840
Scared the hell out of my wife and little girl.

483
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,009
And where are they now?

484
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,578
I sent them to a motel where they'll be safe.

485
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,114
Not that you give a damn
what happens to me or my family.

486
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,883
That's not true, Mr. Campbell.

487
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,952
Well, then where was that
protective detail that you promised?

488
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,622
The shift doesn't start until midnight.

489
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,291
How convenient.

490
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,960
Did you see who fired the shots?

491
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,262
I didn't have to.

492
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,533
I saw Winfield standing across the street,
staring at the apartment.

493
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,268
A few minutes later the window explodes.

494
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,402
Had he threatened you?

495
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,070
Coming up the street he grabbed me,

496
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,872
and told me to get out of the neighborhood.

497
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,841
When I told him to go to hell...

498
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,445
he said if I didn't listen, I was gonna
end up like the other two guys.

499
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,854
Okay. When the protective detail gets here,

500
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:11,716
we'll escort your family back home.

501
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,985
No, thanks, Detective...

502
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,350
they're safer where they are.

503
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,496
I worked at the shop until 10:00.
Then I went home.

504
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,465
- You go out for dinner break?
- About 6:00.

505
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,433
Where'd you go?

506
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,701
For a walk.

507
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:33,104
James Campbell said that you wound up
at his place, threatened his life.

508
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,674
I tried to save his neck,
but he wouldn't listen.

509
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:39,044
Instead he gets in my face, 
calls me a stalker.

510
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,881
I don't have to take that from anyone,
least of all a stinking rapist.

511
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,406
That why you took a shot at him?

512
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,086
I didn't shoot at anybody.

513
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,821
He saw you outside his window.

514
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,859
He was mistaken. 
Like I said, I was at work.

515
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,727
Anybody with you?

516
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,922
My partner Paul Cormick.

517
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,535
We're rebuilding an engine,
the block is cracked.

518
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,437
How many guns do you own?

519
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,674
Five...
counting the engraved Marine Dragoon.

520
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,408
But you already know that, don't you?

521
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,776
You expecting a war?

522
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,575
I shoot competitively.
But you know that, too.

523
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,284
Tell you what...

524
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,521
why don't the two of you
tell me what you want...

525
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,457
and I'll tell you
if I'm gonna make it easy...

526
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,725
or I'm gonna make it hard.

527
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,960
- Give up your 9mm for testing.
- No.

528
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,097
Then why do we have to go through this, then?

529
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,533
You gonna play us,
we'll just keep right on digging.

530
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,401
Then grab a shovel, brother.

531
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,071
No probable cause, no warrant, no guns.

532
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,240
We know that you followed these guys.

533
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,410
And no one filed a complaint,
so what's the problem?

534
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,779
The problem is anyone
you don't like, they wind up dead.

535
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,382
Pedophiles and rapists.

536
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,315
Don't waste your pity.

537
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,549
You used to be a good cop, 
what happened?

538
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,694
Are you guys gonna charge me 
with anything?

539
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,095
Or can I go home now?

540
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,205
That was Munch.

541
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,742
Cormick's wife puts her husband
at home by 9:00 pm.

542
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,978
Well, there goes Winfield's alibi.

543
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,380
We'll need warrants to cover
the garage and home.

544
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,507
Cabot's already on it.

545
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,218
Take a look at this.

546
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,588
I called Winfield's captain in Albany.

547
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,791
Got the off-the-record on his bad shoot.

548
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,094
Turns out the gun the perp
was carrying had no prints.

549
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,195
It was a drop?

550
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,097
Serial number was filed clean.

551
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,467
Winfield had eight commendations
up to that point?

552
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,704
That's why they offered
him early retirement.

553
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,073
The case he was working on 
was real bad ass.

554
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,700
Captain said it ate him to the bone.

555
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,144
The warrants are on the way.

556
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,146
I already sent Munch and Fin 
to the residence.

557
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,738
You two go to the business.
The unis'll meet you there.

559
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,758
What the hell is this?

560
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,556
Sorry, Sam. I couldn't stop them.

561
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,539
So much for professional courtesy.

562
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,907
You brought this on yourself.

563
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,644
Just another day on
the thin blue line, Detective?

564
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,978
- You better watch out.
- Yeah.

565
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,480
Or you'll wind up just like me.

566
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,748
Well, thanks for the advice.

567
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,550
Just let us do our job and
we'll be out of your hair.

568
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,955
- You all right?
- Yep.

569
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,089
I'll get the first-aid kit.

570
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:42,218
Detectives, found this
in an oil drum out back.

571
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,798
Mr. Winfield, I won't forget
about that first aid kit.

572
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,068
You're under arrest for the murder
of Thomas Marchek and Craig Moss...

573
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,137
and the attempted murder of James Campbell.

574
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,939
- You have the right to remain silent.
- I know my rights.

575
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,430
Well, then, let's get out of here.

576
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,746
Ballistics report came back
positive for the Campbell attack.

577
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,248
But it's no match on the murders.

578
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,783
- You sure?
- Tested it twice.

579
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,151
We don't have the murder weapon.

580
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,352
Then we don't have a case.

581
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,188
The most I can charge him with is
attempted murder on Mr. Campbell.

582
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,524
- Unless you play hardball.
- What are you suggesting?

583
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,827
You could threaten to kick up enough
dust to re-open the Albany investigation.

584
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,363
Look, wait a minute, I read the file.

585
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,099
There was a kid in the car and
he thought the perp was carrying.

586
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,501
The skell had already raped
and tortured the kid's mother.

587
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,104
I know the facts. But we've
got two murders to close.

588
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,140
So we pad our win column
at the expense of a good cop...

589
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,475
because he made a judgment call?

590
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,611
If he killed those men, I don't give a damn
how many commendations he had.

591
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,513
He's a murderer and 
we're going to nail his ass.

592
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,503
Now do you have a problem with that?

593
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,045
- All I'm saying...
- What?

594
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:42,245
What are you saying, Detective?

595
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,024
I think I understand him.

596
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:49,015
And I'm asking for a shot at him.

597
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,838
You know, these rooms 
all look the same.

598
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,847
They've got one up in Albany with
a window just like this one.

599
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,542
Same rusty gratings, same size.

600
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,419
Rooms even smell the same.

601
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,921
- How long on the job?
- Sixteen years.

602
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,855
Solid, from what I hear.

603
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,125
I was on my way to being Captain.

604
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,664
Then Alan Cryter came along.

605
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,531
I had my own Alan Cryter.

606
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:38,443
Insurance salesman. Ran his business
out of a converted garage in Queens.

607
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:43,581
Well liked. Would invite the neighborhood
kids up for ice cream and stories.

608
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:47,018
One day, a six-year-old girl goes missing...

609
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,155
from a playground in Soho.

610
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,090
Actually...

611
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,126
long story short, we find her...

612
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,664
underneath the floorboards of his office,
along with three other children.

613
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:03,234
All of them in various stages 
of decomposition.

614
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:07,305
But he is gone, and I'm left...

615
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,170
with a cold case.

616
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:16,677
And two years nothing but silence...
and headaches.

617
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,685
I developed these debilitating headaches.

618
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,787
I wasn't sleeping a lot.

619
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:26,524
I kept having these recurring nightmares...

620
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,093
where my own children would be
underneath these floorboards...

621
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,618
that I couldn't pry up.

622
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:38,130
And then one day I'm just gassing up
my car in Chelsea and there he is.

623
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,773
And before I know it I've got his face...

624
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,910
sandwiched between his windshield
and the muzzle of my gun.

625
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,004
And I'm yelling, "Freeze."

626
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:53,952
And I realize that I'm yelling at myself.

627
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,622
Because I can't stop my finger
from pulling the trigger.

628
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:01,326
And I'm praying for him to blink.
I'm praying for him to twitch.

629
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:05,830
Just do something to give me an excuse.

630
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,128
And then I see a face inside of his car.

631
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,124
It's...

632
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:17,809
a girl, this beautiful,
little six-year-old girl...

633
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,470
these big eyes.

634
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,207
I figured she'd seen enough.

635
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,712
Yeah, she'd seen enough.

636
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,361
Your headaches go away?

637
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,392
Yeah.

638
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,227
It's the only difference between us.

639
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,245
I didn't see the kid's eyes.

640
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:58,681
The perp pulled him from the car
and used him as a shield.

641
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,121
After what the loser had done
to the mother and the sister...

642
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,189
I had no doubts what he'd do with the boy.

643
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:09,591
Anyway, the boy bit him and ran. I shot.

644
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,301
I could have sworn 
that son of a bitch had a gun.

645
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,098
But maybe...

646
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,030
it was just wishful thinking.

647
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,280
We've got to do the right thing here.

648
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,329
I didn't kill those men.

649
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,973
I handed out flyers to inform
and prevent. That's all.

650
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,541
James Campbell?

651
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,309
James Campbell was next on the list.

652
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,677
I figured if I scared him off,
at least he'd be alive.

653
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,809
Anything else you can tell me?

654
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,458
On the night of Marchek's murder,
I was on duty.

655
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,597
I heard the shots.
I ran towards the sound.

656
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:24,836
When I got there, I saw a woman
fleeing the crime scene.

657
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,701
Description?

658
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,710
5'6", brown hair, 120-ish lbs.

659
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,248
Black leather jacket, flapping open,
blue sequined top, dark pants...

660
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,908
boots.

661
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,087
Why didn't you tell us this before?

662
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:53,126
When I saw it was Marchek,
I figured he got what he deserved.

663
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,301
Can you do me any favors on this?

664
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,884
Gloria's not here, Detective.
She's off today.

665
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,553
- But she was on Thursday.
- Yeah. Why?

666
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,922
Her time card said she worked till 3:00 am.

667
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,324
- So?
- She work the whole night?

668
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,392
Must've.

669
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,849
How well did you know her boyfriend?

670
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:25,296
Not very well.
She said he was nice.

671
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,698
Which she deserved after
the long line of scuzzballs...

672
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,168
who mooched her money
and beat the crap out of her.

673
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,836
It was sad when they broke up.

674
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,005
Broke up? When did that happen?

675
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,008
About a week ago.
Glo took it hard.

676
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,743
I think she still loved him.

677
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,446
Missed a lot of work.
Almost got canned.

678
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,915
But she worked until 3:00 last Thursday?

679
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,750
You checked her time card.

680
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,952
We have a witness that says otherwise.

681
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,588
Unless you want to be charged
as accessory to murder,

682
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,488
I suggest you tell us the truth.

683
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,230
Gloria ducked out about 11:00.

684
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,965
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

685
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,835
- Did she come back?
- No.

686
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:07,071
Manager didn't miss her, so
I punched her card when I left.

687
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:10,875
- Did she work night before last?
- It was her night off.

688
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,411
Look, I know Gloria.

689
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,747
She's a little messed up,
but she's a sweet girl.

690
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,044
She wouldn't hurt anybody.

691
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,020
You sure about that?
Okay, John, thanks a lot.

692
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,189
Seems Gloria's alibi just went south.

693
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,747
Here it is.

694
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,661
Gloria!

695
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,332
Detectives Benson and Stabler.
We spoke this morning.

696
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,833
Wow.

697
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:40,037
She said that she'd be here,
as if she could really hear me.

698
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,172
Gloria?

699
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,275
Damn inconsiderate.
Did you get any answer?

700
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,443
And who are you?

701
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:49,280
Earl Zito, I live below in 2-C.
Listen to that.

702
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,782
- How long's this been going on?
- Over an hour.

703
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:55,052
Yeah, I called the super,
but you know, it's...

704
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,188
Stay there please.

705
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,656
I hope the deadbolt isn't on.

706
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,260
Olivia!

707
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,008
Call for a wagon. I got a pulse here.
Very faint.

708
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,840
2414 to central. 2414 to central.

709
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,680
Got a 10-54 attempted suicide...

710
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,883
at 28 Lexington Avenue and 26th Street.

711
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,285
Put a rush on the bus.

712
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,086
Grab another towel.
I'm making a tourniquet.

714
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,026
Can you tie the other one for me?

715
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,563
We need to get her downstairs.
Gloria, can you hear me?

716
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,553
Stay with me.

717
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,601
She's a lucky young woman...

718
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,537
another minute or two and
she would've bled to death.

719
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,472
Can we talk to her now?

720
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:53,544
Before you do, I need to inform you
about your potential exposure.

721
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,479
To what?

722
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,152
The paramedics found Viracept,
a protease inhibitor,

723
00:36:58,152 --> 00:36:59,817
in Gloria's medicine cabinet.

724
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,287
She confirmed that she's HIV-positive.

725
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,457
Since there was a lot of blood 
at the scene...

726
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:10,461
- Elliot.
- Okay, Doc. Thanks for the heads-up.

727
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,764
We should talk to Gloria
while she's still awake.

728
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,836
You should've just let me die.

729
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,538
That's not an answer.

730
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,040
How do you know?

731
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,943
Did you hurt yourself
because of Tommy Marchek?

732
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,511
Yes.

733
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,747
Because he broke up with you?

734
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,982
I broke up with him.

735
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:35,653
- Why?
- Son of a bitch gave me HIV.

736
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,788
Is that why you killed him?

737
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,653
Isn't that enough?

738
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,084
And Moss?

739
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,229
Who?

740
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,060
Craig Moss.

741
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,592
I killed him, too.

742
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,899
- Why'd you use a knife on him?
- What do you care?

743
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,543
He's dead. I did it.

744
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,213
Now leave me alone.

745
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,324
She's lying. She's protecting someone.

746
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,293
The question is, who?

747
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,696
We still haven't found any connection
between Gloria and Moss.

748
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,798
I don't even think she knew the guy.

749
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,668
Hold on. Wait a minute.

750
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,904
Gloria said Marchek gave her HIV.

751
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,940
Moss had HIV.

752
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,206
Did CSU get everything
from her medicine cabinet?

753
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,002
Yeah.

754
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,661
Viracept. It was prescribed by
a Dr. Williams at the State Street Clinic.

755
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:55,900
Crime lab reports Marchek and Moss
both got their meds from the same place.

756
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,235
Gloria's friend, Louise,
works there as a social worker.

757
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,671
How much you wanna bet
she counseled Marchek and Moss?

758
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,140
Check the phone records
and meds on all three...

759
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,268
and run a background check.
Then bring her in.

760
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,552
- How long has she been waiting?
- Twenty minutes.

761
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,849
Doesn't look too rattled.

762
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,290
She brought work with her from the clinic.

763
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,791
Now that's dedication.

764
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,283
She's also got a permit for a 9mm Glock.

767
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,807
Well, in your job,
don't you sometimes win?

768
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:48,386
What I meant was
don't you people say that...

769
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,548
HIV is no longer a death sentence?

770
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,358
Yes, we do.

771
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,793
We can treat it, but we can't cure it.

772
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:02,566
We were hoping that you could
tie up some loose ends for us.

773
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,903
- What kind of loose ends?
- Thomas Marchek, Craig Moss...

774
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,677
they were patients of yours, weren't they?

775
00:40:07,677 --> 00:40:09,640
Yes.

776
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,344
- Gloria Palmera?
- Yes. Yeah.

777
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,278
Gloria confessed to murdering 
Marchek and Moss.

778
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,683
She did?

779
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:23,744
After she tried to kill herself last night.

780
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,626
Oh, God.

781
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,991
Is she all right?

782
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,166
Well, she's weak. She's confused.

783
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,134
She wasn't really making
a whole lot of sense.

784
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,601
That's because she was
trying to protect me.

785
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,339
Tell us.

786
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,455
I counseled Thomas Marchek 
for four months.

787
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,325
And he told me he wasn't
being intimate with anyone.

788
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:04,061
And then one session he let it slip.

789
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:09,191
Bragged about his girlfriend's
insatiable appetite for him.

790
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,437
I told him to tell Gloria
to come in to be tested.

791
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,840
- Did she?
- No.

792
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,178
He kept making excuses about
why he hadn't told her. So I told her.

793
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,080
At first she wouldn't believe it...

794
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,916
but then when the test results
came back positive...

795
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:29,715
she finally saw him for
the bastard that he was.

796
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,680
Why did you kill him?

797
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:40,064
He murdered her with his lies.

798
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,122
That's why.

799
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,703
And Moss?

800
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,520
Why would I give him another chance

801
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,642
to do that again to somebody else?

802
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,078
It's bad enough to be raped, Detective...

803
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,214
but when the rapist has HIV,
he leaves you with a daily reminder...

804
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,978
that'll last you for the rest of your life.

805
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,319
I know, I was raped nine years ago.

806
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,598
You're HIV-positive?

807
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,235
No, I have AIDS.

808
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,404
I'm dying.

809
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,168
Drugs don't work for me anymore.

810
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,209
I wasn't gonna let them
kill another woman.

811
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,265
You think the Grand Jury will indict her?

812
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,901
She did murder two men.

813
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,063
Will she live long enough 
to serve her sentence?

814
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,370
You okay?

815
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:08,452
- You wanna go grab a drink?
- No, I should go home.

816
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,419
- Sure?
- Yeah.

817
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:15,049
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- You will.

818
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,425
Elliot...

819
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,869
how'd it go with the doc?

820
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:31,141
She said the bandage probably kept
most of Gloria's blood from entering the wound.

821
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:36,013
Just in case, she gave me a month's
supply of antiretrovirals.

822
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,215
- Then what?
- Wait and see.

823
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,808
That's gonna make for a hell of a month.

824
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:46,457
- Listen, if there's anything...
- I got it covered.

825
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,059
Well, you got my number.

826
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,548
Captain?

827
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,354
Thanks.

828
00:43:55,354 --> 00:43:58,128
