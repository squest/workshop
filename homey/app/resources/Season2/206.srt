2
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:24,943
In the criminal justice system,

3
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:28,644
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

4
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:29,912
In New York City,

5
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:33,436
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

6
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:36,462
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

7
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:38,689
These are their stories.

8
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:42,390
Morning, Maggie.

9
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,215
Maggie, where's my coffee?

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,127
Maggie?

11
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,893
Maggie?

12
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,097
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,648
I...I need help.

14
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:21,214
Two victims.

15
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,187
Night manager, Margaret Sandomir.

16
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:25,674
As far as we can tell,
she was raped and shot.

17
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:27,337
John Doe was by the trash...

18
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,291
stabbed several times in the back,
chest, and genitals.

19
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,590
- He is on his way to Mercy.
- Who called it in?

20
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,082
Alvin Maddox.
Works construction.

21
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,555
Mr. Maddox?

22
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,317
I'm Detective Benson.
How you holding up?

23
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:44,946
I never did see a dead body in my life.

24
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:47,936
I mean, not before an undertaker
got to them, you know.

25
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:50,289
I'll try to make this as quick and
painless as possible.

26
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,978
I just need you to tell me what you saw.

27
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:56,245
I really didn't notice anything wrong
until I got to the coffee pot.

28
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,960
There was none.

29
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,949
Then I saw all the blood and
Maggie behind the counter.

30
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,146
Who would do that?

31
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:06,334
Everybody loved her.

32
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,335
Did you know the other victim
who was found outside?

33
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:13,666
I didn't even see the poor bastard at first.
Almost lost my breakfast.

34
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:16,553
Mr. Maddox,
I'm gonna need your shoes.

35
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:19,470
Oh, my God. I didn't...

36
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:22,383
I wasn't... / I just need to
eliminate your footprints

37
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:25,670
so I'll write you a receipt and we'll
return them to you when we're done.

38
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,490
Are you kidding?

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,729
Toss them or burn them.
I'll never wear them again.

40
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:31,648
Okay, sit tight.
I'll have someone take you home.

41
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,369
Body's been tampered with.

42
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:48,280
Shot in the back, but laying face up
and the shoes are on the wrong feet.

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,500
The M.E. Said
he found no trace of fluids

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,462
so it looks like our guy wore a condom.

45
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,453
So far, too much blood and
not enough forensics.

46
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:00,530
Just what I like.
A smart predator.

47
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,101
Okay, so we got two victims,
one shot, one stabbed.

48
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,776
One inside, the other out on the street.

49
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,789
But from the looks of it,
it all started in here.

50
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,674
If he had a gun, why the knife?

51
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:11,691
Something went wrong.

52
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:15,788
Maybe we're looking for two perps.

2x06 Noncompliance

63
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,336
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/11/24

64
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,664
Money was still in the drawer.
$200 and change.

65
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,861
That's why we're thinking
it's a rape that got interrupted.

66
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,138
- Surveillance camera?
- Non-functional for some time.

67
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:13,760
It's not in a high crime area.

68
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,592
The owner thought its presence
was deterrent enough.

69
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:18,077
Well, who's our corpse?

70
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:20,831
Margaret Sandomir, night manager.

71
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,106
Works midnight to 6:00 a.m.
Beloved by all.

72
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,479
Not entirely.
Has the family been notified?

73
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,856
Mother took a sedative.

74
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:29,731
Our second vic has no ID.

75
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:32,357
Just a few dollars in his pocket
and a set of keys.

76
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,935
So he's probably going
in for a midnight snack

77
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:37,675
and winds up getting stabbed
in the chest and genitals instead.

78
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:40,464
Focused or frenzied attack?

79
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:43,313
Both. / Two different guys,
two different weapons

80
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:46,030
so one was organized,
the other one out of control.

81
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,835
What if we got one guy,
two weapons?

82
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:49,523
Maybe he was in control and lost it

83
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,659
when our second victim
interrupted his flow.

84
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,039
I'll check the computer to see if

85
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:55,694
they got any hits on perps
that like to carry both.

86
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:59,934
Until our victim wakes up
to give us any pertinent information.

87
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:03,412
Munch, Fin, knock on doors.
If he's local, let's try to ID the guy.

88
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:08,534
Benson, Stabler, talk to the Sandomir family.
Get some background.

89
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,883
Sandomir Residence
356 West 19th Street
Monday, November 13

90
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:13,412
She was getting her Ph.D.

91
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:16,470
In psychology at Columbia
during the day.

92
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:20,737
We thought since the market was
just two blocks away that she'd be safe.

93
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,847
It's our neighborhood.
Everybody knows her.

94
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:27,766
Did she have any enemies?
Was there ever any trouble?

95
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:34,495
She did have some difficulty with
one of the patients at the clinic

96
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,610
but she assured me that
was taken care of.

97
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,227
What patient was this?

98
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:40,693
Maggie interned
at a mental health clinic twice a week.

99
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:45,582
This man fantasized that he and
Maggie had a relationship.

100
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:48,092
He stalked her.

101
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,409
What's his name?

102
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:52,551
Oh, I don't remember.

103
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:54,735
There was a police report.

104
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:58,508
Maggie assured me that
he wasn't dangerous.

105
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:00,217
Do you have the name of the clinic?

106
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,621
H.M.H. Clinic.

107
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:05,576
Homeless Mental Health.

108
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:13,212
Hi. / Hi. Can I help you?

109
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:15,848
- Could I see Dr. Klein?
- She's in a session.

110
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:16,909
Need about five minutes.

111
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,829
She'll be done in 30.
So have a seat.

112
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:22,494
Great.
Thank you.

113
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:26,389
Guy stalking our victim
is Ben Moreland.

114
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,920
She took out a restraining order.

115
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,639
So much for him not being dangerous.

116
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,773
You want to go and come back later?

117
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:34,665
Let's have Munch take it.

118
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,058
They pulled the 61 on Moreland.

119
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:53,414
He was stalking our victim
for almost a month.

120
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,528
Became agitated when
approached by uniforms.

121
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:58,324
He had box cutters taped to his hands.
One cop almost got cut.

122
00:06:58,324 --> 00:06:59,272
When was this?

123
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:00,805
- Two weeks ago.
- He at Rikers?

124
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,059
Claims insanity.

125
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,949
Said the Unis had laser beams for eyes
and were trying to fry him.

126
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,678
The judge ordered him to take
his meds and sent him home.

127
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,393
Address is West 54th Street.

128
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:12,197
What are the odds
he's still not taking his pills?

129
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:16,758
Hello?

130
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,838
Ben Moreland?

131
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:29,871
What's this about?

132
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,976
Maggie Sandomir.

133
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:37,311
I'm not allowed within 500 feet of her.

134
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,825
Where were you last night?

135
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,810
Right here. Why?

136
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,992
Anyone with you?

137
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,357
Just me and the four walls closing in.

138
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:54,530
She say I was bothering her again?
Because I swear I wasn't.

139
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,278
Miss Sandomir is dead.

140
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,303
No.

141
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:04,543
- I just talked to her.
- In person?

142
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:07,122
She called me.

143
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:11,643
Wanted to know how things were
going with the new shrink.

144
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:14,335
She referred him.
She was always good to me.

145
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,655
I guess that's why I'm fixated.

146
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:23,179
She helped me get my disability
and get off the street.

147
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:26,004
- Take my meds consistent.
- The court order helped, too.

148
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,476
You still complying?

149
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:29,263
I take Fluphenazine.

150
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:35,712
Guess I'm supposed to live
with the drooling and the shakes.

151
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,915
You're very talented.

152
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:42,727
Only when I'm crazy.

153
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:46,733
I haven't been able to work since
they forced me to take the medication.

154
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,071
Is it helping?

155
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:49,989
Depends.

156
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:55,241
I'm not hearing voices telling me
to rip my own throat out.

157
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:58,262
It's supposed to make me better,
so I can hold down a job.

158
00:08:58,262 --> 00:09:00,816
Who the hell's going to hire me like this?

159
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:04,626
I don't work. I'm going to be out
on the street again.

160
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:09,477
It's tragic,
what happened to Maggie.

161
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:12,709
- Anything I can do?
- Yes, we need a list of her patients.

162
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,792
Anything except that.

163
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:17,187
Doctor, we understand you'd like to
protect their confidentiality

164
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:18,991
but this is a rape-murder investigation.

165
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,448
- That list won't help you.
- Why not?

166
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:22,856
These people don't have addresses.

167
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:24,670
They're scattered all over the city.

168
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,425
Can we get the schedule of when they're
due to come in for their medication?

169
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:31,135
So they can be traumatized
by the experience?

170
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,871
I betray their trust,
they don't show the next time.

171
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:36,490
It's hard enough to get them to
take their meds to begin with.

172
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,746
We can get a court order.

173
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:39,178
Then that's what you'll have to do.

174
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,010
I'm not unsympathetic, just protective.

175
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,355
And uncooperative.

176
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:47,304
My patients suffer from manic depression
mood disorders, and schizophrenia.

177
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,052
That doesn't make them killers.

178
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:53,051
Yet there's an unbelievable stigma
when most of them are not violent.

179
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,252
Doctor, are all of your patients
under control?

180
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:57,762
If they take their meds and
work with their doctors, yes.

181
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,543
And if they don't?

182
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:02,587
Instead of hounding patients struggling
with their disease

183
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:05,276
you should be checking
the subject of Maggie's thesis.

184
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,499
Mark Nash.

185
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:09,281
And why doesn't he fall
under your protective cover?

186
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:11,341
Mark Nash was non-compliant.

187
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:13,463
He refused to take medication.

188
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:17,405
I absolutely believe
that medication and therapy

189
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:20,940
give the best possible
relief for schizophrenia.

190
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,209
Maggie advocated
a patient's right to choose.

191
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,037
But how can a sick mind
even recognize that it's ill?

192
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:33,565
Lab came back on our footprints.
Only three sets.

193
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:36,324
The victim outside and
our witness, Maddox.

194
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:39,029
Looks like we're looking for
only one perp.

195
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,790
Nothing on Mark Nash.

196
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,525
No complaints, no violence.
Nothing. Zip.

197
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,125
First time for everything.

198
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,392
So you think the guy goes from zero to rape
and murder because he's schizophrenic?

199
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:50,395
If he's not in his right mind, hell, yes.

200
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:53,319
And who is the arbiter of mental health?
Are you sane?

201
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,658
And how do you know
if you're not unless somebody tells you?

202
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,692
And how do they know they're not?

203
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,696
What about Moreland?
He look good to you?

204
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:01,492
Nothing so far.
He's got no alibi.

205
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:03,666
But I don't see him going out
in that condition.

206
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,981
He stalked her. If anybody's
seen him lately, we'll find out.

207
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:10,896
Be hard to miss him with all
the facial twitches, tremors, and drool.

208
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:12,516
Probably extra-pyramidal.

209
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:16,439
I got Maggie Sandomir's thesis
from Dr. Klein.

210
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:20,683
That sounds like the side effects you
get from long-term usage of anti-psychotics.

211
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:23,862
You get involuntary muscle spasms
among other things.

212
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,823
That's why a lot of them
refuse the medication.

213
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,547
Right, but we can't possibly know
which ones are dangerous

214
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:29,466
when they are gonna snap.

215
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,859
That's why taking their meds
shouldn't be an option.

216
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,098
You'd suppress an individual's right
to refuse medical treatment?

217
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:37,176
For the public safety?
Absolutely.

218
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,899
Our John Doe is out of
surgery and awake.

219
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,634
So let's get his statement.
All right, keep me posted.

220
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,400
How's he doing?
He still got all his parts?

221
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,609
Can't this wait?

222
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,968
And if he croaks in the next five minutes?

223
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,797
He just came out of major surgery.

224
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,531
We're trying to find out
who put him there.

225
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:58,585
Don't worry, this'll be short and sweet.

226
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,131
Sir.

227
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:01,748
Yeah.

228
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,434
What's your name?

229
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:05,938
Miller.

230
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:08,128
Earl Miller.

231
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:10,631
Can we call anybody for you?

232
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:12,873
No.

233
00:12:13,144 --> 00:12:15,685
Did you get a good look at
who did this to you?

234
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:20,750
Slight...

235
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,198
white...

236
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:24,875
in 20s or 30s...

237
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:27,612
brown hair...

238
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,369
crazy.

239
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:33,064
I saw him attack that woman.

240
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,960
Crazy?
What, did he say something?

241
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,347
Russian something.

242
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:39,041
He spoke with an accent?

243
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,930
No.

244
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,159
Please.

245
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,360
Mr. Nash?

246
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:05,591
Mark Nash?

247
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:08,446
"Raskolnikov..."

248
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:10,122
"it was I..."

249
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,604
"who killed the old pawnbroker woman
and her sister with an axe."

250
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:15,433
Mr. Nash, I'm going to need
to see your hands.

251
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,319
"317 rubles."

252
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,429
- I need to see your hands.
- "60 kopecks."

253
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,648
Mr. Nash, why don't you
stand up slowly?

254
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:23,238
Show me your hands.

255
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:25,251
Put your hands behind your head.

256
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:28,036
Down.

257
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:31,822
Mr. Nash, you're under arrest.

258
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,795
- "I do not repent."
- That's great.

259
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:59,597
Mark, we already know what happened,
so it's okay for you to tell us.

260
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,054
You had an episode.

261
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:02,808
You got all lost in your head, right?

262
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,974
Did she say something
or do something that set you off?

263
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,024
- Is that why you hit her?
- No. No. No. No.

264
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:10,984
Mark, I tell you, you hit her so hard,
she came out of her shoes.

265
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:13,585
You felt bad, so you tried to
put them back on her feet

266
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:16,950
but you got them
on the wrong feet, is that right?

267
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,410
"Razumihin, you think I'm mad?"

268
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,863
"Have a drink.
You'll feel better."

269
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:23,868
You've had enough for all of us.

270
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,641
I can still smell the beer on you.

271
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,535
You're not drunk, are you?

272
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,222
Is Maggie dead?

273
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:31,313
You know she is,
because you killed her.

274
00:14:31,313 --> 00:14:33,789
And then you stabbed a witness.
He might not make it.

275
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,028
I hope he's dead.

276
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:37,820
- So you did stab him?
- Yes.

277
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,425
Mark.

278
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,806
Just calm down.

279
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:49,930
Mark, calm down, okay?

280
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,341
We just want to help, so why don't you
sit down and we'll talk?

281
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,492
We won't be getting
anything out of him for now.

282
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:05,197
Not while he's delusional.

283
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,916
Defense is going to ask for a 730.

284
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,006
State Examiner will keep him
until he's fit for trial.

285
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:12,741
Maybe we'll get his story instead of
Dostoyevsky's Crime And Punishment.

286
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:16,069
We've got enough for the assault to
confine him to a state hospital.

287
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:18,306
The blood on the knife
came back as Miller's.

288
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:19,864
I'd like the gun to close it up tight.

289
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:22,686
The M.E. Found two hairs on the body,
follicles intact,

290
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,512
so maybe we don't need it.

291
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,232
I never turn down evidence.

292
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:29,524
Munch and Fin are talking to
Nash's mother in the interview room.

293
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:33,612
Let's serve her the notice while
she's here, and then go toss the house.

294
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:37,190
When he didn't come, I went looking.

295
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,721
He didn't have his keys.
He loses them or forgets them.

296
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:43,425
I went to the market.
It was closed.

297
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:46,433
There was yellow crime scene tape
over it.

298
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,660
I've been running everywhere
trying to find my son.

299
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,618
In hospitals, police stations,
even the morgue.

300
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:57,392
Now I'm here.
So, please, what did Mark do?

301
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:59,214
Maggie Sandomir is dead.

302
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:01,511
She was sexually assaulted
and shot in the back.

303
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:02,447
Oh, my...

304
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:05,062
Customer came in.
Wrong place, wrong time.

305
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:08,436
He got stabbed for his trouble,
but he'll make it.

306
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:11,694
My son isn't violent.

307
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:16,622
Mrs. Nash, he took a knife out of his pocket,
and his clothes are stained in blood.

308
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:20,496
This is impossible.

309
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:24,496
He adores Maggie.

310
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:28,384
He was so withdrawn,
and she took the time to reach him.

311
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:30,832
They spent evenings together.

312
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:33,411
Sometimes he helped her
in the market.

313
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,099
They were close.

314
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:38,346
As close as Mark can be.

315
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:40,957
He would never hurt her.
Never.

316
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:44,625
He refuses to take any medication.
Has he ever been on anything?

317
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,833
Clozapine made
his white blood cells drop.

318
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,132
Chlorpromazine made him sleep...

319
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:53,500
18 out of 24 hours in a day.

320
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,409
He refuses to try again.

321
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:56,975
Does he drink?

322
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,568
Yes.

323
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:02,292
I never give him much money,
but he always manages to buy beer.

324
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,407
Did he ever show any signs of violence?

325
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:05,506
Never.

326
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:06,890
Do you own a handgun?

327
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,015
Yes.

328
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:10,922
I understand if you're afraid of him.

329
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,649
I bought that gun...

330
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:17,548
to protect Mark against
the neighborhood ignorants.

331
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:20,214
They chase him and frighten him.

332
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:22,826
They're obsessed, terrified...

333
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:26,685
that he'll freak out and hurt them
or their children.

334
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:30,833
The media has done an excellent job
of demonizing schizophrenics

335
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:35,553
so that when people look at my son
they don't see a human being.

336
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:38,281
Mark doesn't scare me, Detective.

337
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:42,335
Pathetic, narrow-minded people do.

338
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:47,664
Ms. Cabot.

339
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:50,345
Matt Wooding, counsel for Mark Nash.

340
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:52,390
Alex Cabot for the People.

341
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,209
Nice day for a walk in the park.

342
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,604
Maybe. What are you offering?

343
00:17:56,604 --> 00:17:58,319
10 years in a state hospital.

344
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,807
Court-monitored medication
compliance for the duration.

345
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:04,138
That's a little stiff. Six inside,
remaining four on compliance.

346
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:07,456
No. Have you seen
the crime scene photos?

347
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,372
You've only got him
for Miller's assault.

348
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,002
Last I checked,
he was still breathing.

349
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:14,600
Just barely and now
he's missing a piece of action.

350
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,235
Eight inside, five on compliance.

351
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:18,670
But if I find the murder weapon,
the deal's off the table.

352
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,643
You mean if you find a gun with
Mark's prints on it, don't you?

353
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,990
I'll talk to the mother.

354
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:29,741
Nash Residence
172 West 25th Street
Monday, November 13

355
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,934
We're looking for a.38.

356
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:37,173
Suspect's mother owns one,
so concentrate on her bedroom.

357
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,691
I guess this is his corner.

358
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:45,577
- He's got the right idea.
- It just seems nutty to me.

359
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:49,541
You know, maybe it's his way of
making the shows more interesting.

360
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,316
Maggie gave Mark Nash a chance,

361
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:54,877
and it cost her, her life.

362
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:58,129
Is that your reason for doing
what you did in the interview?

363
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:00,351
- What did I do?
- Well, he was starting to talk.

364
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,693
If we had just gone at him easy,
he would've come around.

365
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:05,106
I asked the hard questions,
he confessed.

366
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:07,372
They should all be that easy.

367
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:12,398
Six months out of the Academy,
I worked a crime scene...

368
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:15,690
where a schizophrenic hacked his father
to death and then he offed himself.

369
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,734
Whole place was covered with blood.

370
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:19,730
Turns out he stopped taking his meds.

371
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,550
Look, Olivia, that is your experience
with one guy.

372
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,342
Even shrinks can't predict their behavior.

373
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:27,581
It's for their good that
they take their medication.

374
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:29,926
Okay, what are we gonna do?
We gonna shove pills down their throats?

375
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:31,384
If it will get the job done.

376
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,742
You're uncomfortable
with the mentally ill.

377
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:35,708
No, I am uncomfortable
with dangerous unpredictability.

378
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,528
I found this in her lingerie drawer.

379
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,849
Been fired recently?

380
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,946
Arraignment Court Part 65
Wednesday, November 15

381
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:47,802
"People versus Mark Nash."

382
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:50,666
"The charges are one count murder
in the second degree"

383
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,757
"one count of rape in the first degree"

384
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:55,479
"one count assault in the first degree."

385
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,523
How do you plead?

386
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:57,498
Not guilty.

387
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,835
Going for insanity.
What a surprise.

388
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:01,315
Self-defense.

389
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:02,951
Ms. Cabot?

390
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,649
Your Honor, remand without bail.

391
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,262
The defendant is a serious threat
to the community.

392
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:11,288
We'd also like a psych evaluation to
determine mental competence.

393
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,090
Objection.

394
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,573
There's no reason to assess
the defendant's mental health.

395
00:20:14,573 --> 00:20:18,273
We will stipulate that he suffers from
paranoid schizophrenia.

396
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:20,859
A debilitating disease,
but not an incapacitating one.

397
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:23,893
The defendant raped and fatally
shot one victim known to him

398
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:26,986
and severely maimed an innocent
bystander who interrupted his crime.

399
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:29,256
I want to determine whether
or not his illness is a factor

400
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:30,857
in the commission of these brutal crimes.

401
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:33,801
The American Psychiatric Association
would strongly disagree

402
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,826
with Ms. Cabot's narrow-minded
assumption

403
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:38,933
that mental illness is always
a precursor to criminality.

404
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:41,829
That's very P.C., Counselor but...

405
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:45,961
let's just see what the members of
the A.P.A. Actually have to say about it.

406
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:49,112
Remand without bail,
pending psychiatric evaluation.

407
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:51,690
The defendant reserves
the right to refuse medication.

408
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,066
So noted.

409
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:02,299
Shouldn't have to take the poison.

410
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:03,773
Already got cyanide in my head.

411
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:05,503
Don't want any more.
It's in the water.

412
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:07,928
- Mark.
- Agranulocytosis.

413
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:09,993
Seizures, Tardive Dyskinesia...

414
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:12,774
Akathisia, Dystonia, Torticollis...

415
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:16,165
Hypotension, Parkinsonism.

416
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:19,069
Those are side effects
of anti-psychotics.

417
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,987
Mark, is the reason you
refuse medication

418
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:25,352
that you prefer the world
you live in to reality?

419
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:29,353
I'd be crazy if I didn't, wouldn't I?

420
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:32,839
Don't look at me.

421
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,790
Why not?

422
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,091
Because you can see
the books in my head.

423
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:39,297
What kind of books are they?

424
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:41,499
Prognostication.

425
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:45,754
I do it before I see it
and it's exactly like I saw it.

426
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:49,142
What do you see?

427
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,474
I see the safe.

428
00:21:55,406 --> 00:21:57,693
Do you understand
what happened to Maggie?

429
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:58,790
Maggie died.

430
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,684
- She was murdered.
- I know that. She was raped, too.

431
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,082
Yes.

432
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:07,356
Ugly.

433
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:09,319
What is?

434
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:12,689
How I feel about my mother.
Maggie understood...

435
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:16,570
that my hatred stemmed from
a matriarchal obsession with Christ.

436
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,901
I focus not on the crucified but...

437
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:22,750
on the suffering of his mother.

438
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,174
Did you study psychology?

439
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:27,275
Of course.

440
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,938
Sociology, theology...

441
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:31,553
pathology...

442
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:33,505
I'm an autodidact.

443
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:36,036
I sometimes hate my mother.

444
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:39,550
If it weren't for her great suffering...

445
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:42,223
then I could end all this.

446
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:46,660
Do you remember exactly
what happened to Maggie?

447
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:49,718
The safe.

448
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:53,410
The combination to the safe
is needed to get within it.

449
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,960
My life is in the safe,
and the keys are needed to get within.

450
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,470
Where is the safe?

451
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,736
Below the floor. In hell.

452
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:08,209
I dream of angels,
but I live with demons.

453
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:16,434
Miller IDed the loon out of
the photo array.

454
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:17,652
Words have power, Fin.

455
00:23:17,652 --> 00:23:20,423
Keep up the bad karma
I see the Alzheimer's in your future.

456
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:23,471
At least I won't remember
how great I used to be.

457
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:24,905
What did I miss?

458
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,378
Ben Moreland's prints were found
at the crime scene.

459
00:23:27,378 --> 00:23:31,170
And according to DNA, the hairs found
on Maggie Sandomir's body...

460
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,154
are not Mark Nash's.

461
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,911
I can let you have that real cheap.

462
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:45,756
It's not yours to sell.

463
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:48,642
Mr. Moreland is three months
behind in his rent.

464
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:50,880
There's an eviction process.
It's the law.

465
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,507
I followed every step.

466
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:54,727
Furniture's mine and so is the art.

467
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:57,786
Moreland signed an agreement
before I put him out.

468
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,635
He said it was like Picasso
paying for his meals.

469
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,986
- Any idea where he went?
- No.

470
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:05,497
I can let you have that for $50.

471
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:08,083
Take it inside or
I'm gonna have to fine you.

472
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:15,064
I haven't seen Ben Moreland
since the situation with Maggie.

473
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:16,416
We found him a new clinic.

474
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:19,302
- Have you checked with them?
- They haven't seen him in two weeks.

475
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:21,934
And it wasn't a situation.
He was stalking her.

476
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,301
I don't have time for this.

477
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:25,453
I have a lot of patients waiting
to see me.

478
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:27,611
I suggest you cancel
the rest of your schedule

479
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:30,497
because you're going to be
in lock-up for the duration.

480
00:24:30,497 --> 00:24:31,638
On what charge?

481
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,691
Aiding and abetting a prime suspect
in a murder investigation.

482
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:37,146
Now look, Doctor...

483
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:40,919
we're not asking you to
reveal privileged information here.

484
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,198
Look, if Moreland was coming
to you for his meds

485
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:46,296
then that means he was
homeless at the time.

486
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:49,943
So why don't you just tell us
where he liked to hang out?

487
00:24:49,943 --> 00:24:52,203
Try the Shepherd's Flock Shelter.

488
00:24:52,203 --> 00:24:55,184
They used to let him draw on the walls.

489
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,806
I think we should check out
the psych wards also.

490
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,194
Stabler.

491
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:03,094
When did that happen?

492
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,242
Thanks a lot.

493
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:07,258
Ben Moreland's in the tombs.

494
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:10,043
- What for?
- Destruction of private property.

495
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,372
You lied to us when you said
you hadn't seen Maggie.

496
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,481
No, I didn't.

497
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,521
We found your fingerprints in the market.

498
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:25,181
I lied to the other detectives,
I didn't lie to you.

499
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:27,673
Did you kill Maggie Sandomir?

500
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,072
I did.

501
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:38,752
I'd like to do my time at Creedmoor.

502
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,740
Just tell us what happened first.

503
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:45,368
I went to talk to Maggie.

504
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:49,128
I wanted her to tell that quack
she sent me to change my meds.

505
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:52,856
She told me to leave
before she had to call the cops.

506
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:56,656
- Traitor.
- That must have made you angry.

507
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:58,715
Sure.

508
00:25:58,715 --> 00:26:01,572
Is that when you stabbed her?

509
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:10,238
And then I hit her and she fell down.

510
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:13,219
And then I kicked her.

511
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:16,439
Twice.

512
00:26:17,156 --> 00:26:19,545
Then what?

513
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:26,190
Ben, how did you kill Maggie?

514
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,492
You don't know?

515
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:37,282
You know, they have
an art studio there.

516
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:40,366
- It's part of the therapy.
- What is?

517
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:42,636
Painting.

518
00:26:42,898 --> 00:26:46,392
I could probably have my own wall.

519
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:50,160
Take a blood sample to
match against the hairs.

520
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,310
If it comes back negative,
cut him loose.

521
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,155
We are now down to zero suspects.
Any thoughts?

522
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:58,196
We haven't looked at Miller.

523
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:00,459
You think our second victim's the doer?

524
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,258
He's got no ID.

525
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:04,334
But wait, he just recently
moved here, right?

526
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:06,189
From New Hampshire.
They never heard of him either.

527
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,537
An alias?

528
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:09,535
No hits on NCIC.

529
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:10,970
Granted it looks suspicious,

530
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,589
but I hope there's another reason
to turn the screws on one of our victims.

531
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:17,563
How about why that market
when his address is 20 blocks away?

532
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:19,777
I mean, that's a hell of
a hump for a midnight snack.

533
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:23,375
When we asked, he said he was
on his way home from visiting a friend.

534
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,956
This friend have a name?

535
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,350
Oh, God.

536
00:27:29,722 --> 00:27:33,038
I wonder when I can have
solid food again.

537
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:36,023
So, what can I do for you?

538
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:37,527
Just want to go over your statement.

539
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:39,037
Want to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

540
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:42,518
Now you told detectives
you were coming home

541
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,727
- from a friend's house, is that correct?
- That's right.

542
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:46,556
And the friend's name?

543
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:48,568
Why? / Depending on the D.A.,

544
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:51,653
they might want to call your friend in to
testify as to what time you went home.

545
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,783
I thought it was a no-brainer.

546
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:57,705
I heard the guy was found
with the knife in his pocket

547
00:27:57,705 --> 00:27:59,009
and my blood on his clothes.

548
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:03,446
Just give us his name, Mr. Miller,
and we'll get out of your hair.

549
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:09,627
The thing is,
I wasn't with a friend, actually.

550
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:11,654
I was with a pro.

551
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:14,360
Oh, okay. Her place?

552
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,398
- Her car.
- And her name?

553
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:21,233
Why would I want to know that?

554
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:26,454
Thanks.

555
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:30,402
Changing his story.

556
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:32,596
A prostitute in that neighborhood
with a car?

557
00:28:32,596 --> 00:28:34,671
- You notice his eating habits?
- It's convict posture.

558
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,965
It's pretty hard to shake.

559
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:38,633
Excuse me, miss.

560
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,937
Yes?

561
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:41,926
Can you go into Mr. Miller's room,

562
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:44,274
and remove his food tray
but don't touch anything on it?

563
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,390
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you.

564
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,517
Earl Miller's prints belong to Earl Gilmore.

565
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:53,100
Did a seven-out-of-twelve-year stretch
in Sing Sing for armed robbery.

566
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,181
So maybe he goes in to steal...

567
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:56,574
but he does Maggie instead...

568
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:59,196
Nash is the witness,
he sees the attack on his friend

569
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,807
grabs the knife and shreds his stem.

570
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:03,420
- In his mind, poetic justice.
- In anybody's mind.

571
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,825
Any sex offense charges that
didn't hold up?

572
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:06,647
Not one.

573
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:09,735
Seven years in Sing Sing could change
anybody into a sexual predator

574
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,444
and make them smart
enough to know that

575
00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:13,753
DNA can nail you
if you don't use a condom.

576
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,836
We run Gilmore's blood
from the crime scene

577
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:17,789
we'll get a DNA match,
I guarantee it.

578
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,269
It's a chain of evidence issue.
Check with Cabot.

579
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,851
If it's a match, it might be
enough for probable cause.

580
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:25,828
Munch, Fin, head up to
Ossining and get his prison file.

581
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,765
Can't they send it?

582
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:32,480
And while you're there, talk to anybody
who recalls the ex-con's reputation.

583
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,840
Some incidents just
don't make it into the file.

584
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:39,783
Sing Sing Correctional Facility
Ossining, New York
Monday, November 20

585
00:29:39,783 --> 00:29:41,785
Earl Gilmore's file.

586
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:44,339
All you had to do is make a phone call.

587
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:45,738
I'd have sent it over immediately.

588
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:48,393
Truth is we wanted
a drive in the country.

589
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:50,421
Gilmore cause any problems?

590
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,960
The usual disruptions.

591
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,051
Nothing serious, or we'd have
flagged him before parole.

592
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:58,185
Which guards were assigned to
Gilmore's cellblock?

593
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,168
Why?

594
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,167
We'd like to talk to them and
get some background on the prisoner.

595
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,661
Best people to do that are the ones
that eyeballed him every day.

596
00:30:05,661 --> 00:30:07,794
I don't think that's necessary.

597
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:10,565
All the information you need is in that file.

598
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,943
Now, if you'll excuse me.

599
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:17,892
I haven't seen tap dancing like that
since Bring In 'Da Noise.

600
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:18,893
He's protecting his flank.

601
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:21,498
He wants no appearance that
they paroled a convict

602
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:24,894
with violent tendencies back into
the unsuspecting population.

603
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:27,231
It says right here
the shift changes at four.

604
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:29,538
Guard named Wheeler comes on then.
You want to wait?

605
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:30,803
Why him?

606
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:32,646
He filed most of the petty complaints.

607
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:35,035
He might've objected to
the hump's early release.

608
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:37,046
You suppose we can get
a home address on Wheeler?

609
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:40,351
I'll wait right here while
you go back and ask.

610
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:44,988
Gary Wheeler?

611
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,110
You Wheeler?

612
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:54,344
Yeah. / You remember
an ex-con named Earl Gilmore?

613
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:58,080
Got out last year.
Should've done the whole bit.

614
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,004
Why you say that?
Was he a hard ass?

615
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:04,170
When he rotated in, he had the usual bluster
right up until lights out.

616
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,205
His cell mate initiated him
into life at Sing Sing.

617
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:08,514
How bad was that?

618
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:11,534
Fourteen stitches and
a week in the infirmary. / Ouch.

619
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:14,721
It went from bad to worse
till Gilmore decided to pump up.

620
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,742
Smuggled in steroids instead
of the regular contraband.

621
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,126
Steroids made him more aggressive?

622
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,911
And strong as hell.

623
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:25,302
He never once lifted a finger against
the guards but when the new meat arrived,

624
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:28,409
he was on it like a hungry dog.

625
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:31,550
Blood matches the hairs.

626
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,342
But don't arrest him yet.

627
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:34,490
Why not?

628
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,590
It's all circumstantial.

629
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,983
I don't have the murder weapon and

630
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:40,424
I need a credible witness
to charge him with rape.

631
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:42,866
- Mark Nash is a witness.
- I said credible.

632
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:44,324
He's psychotic.

633
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:48,331
Even if I wanted to I couldn't instruct
a jury to disregard his delusions.

634
00:31:48,331 --> 00:31:51,456
So you're saying you can't
win with what we've given you.

635
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,588
You ever hear of reasonable doubt?

636
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:55,059
I need the gun.

637
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:58,067
Fast Stop Market
648 West 23rd Street
Monday, November 20

638
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,482
This is exactly where
Gilmore was found.

639
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:02,554
I don't see him getting
very far in his condition.

640
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,981
He's laying here, he slips the gun in
with the rest of the garbage.

641
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:06,128
He's home free.

642
00:32:06,128 --> 00:32:08,725
Wait a minute, there was
more garbage here before.

643
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:11,700
Yeah. Trash is collected
every Wednesday, if we're lucky.

644
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,460
That was last week?
What company do you use?

645
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,192
Hell if I know.

646
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:20,103
Lassiter. Lassiter Sanitation.

647
00:32:21,177 --> 00:32:24,237
Is it possible to pinpoint exactly
where it is now?

648
00:32:24,237 --> 00:32:27,459
Sure. Each truck carries
22 tons of garbage.

649
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:30,084
It takes 70, 80 trucks to fill a barge.

650
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:31,761
- Sounds like we're wasting our time.
- Trust me.

651
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:33,598
Whatever you're looking for,
we'll find it.

652
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:36,727
Look, even with 800 tons
of garbage in a barge

653
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:39,692
I know exactly where each of
my trucks are off-loaded.

654
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:43,594
We'll just cart it to Staten Island,
have the Hazmat guys sift through it.

655
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,922
- When did we do the pickup?
- Last Wednesday.

656
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,439
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

657
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:50,178
Why not?
Where's the barge now?

658
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:53,718
Somewhere down river,
on its way to Virginia.

659
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,945
You cannot force Mr. Nash
to take anti-psychotics.

660
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:11,198
He has rights.

661
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,144
One of those rights is the right
to refuse medication.

662
00:33:14,144 --> 00:33:17,441
Isn't there any way to use
the assault charge to force him?

663
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:19,978
He exhibited a violent reaction
against someone.

664
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:22,366
Doesn't that constitute a danger
to himself and others?

665
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,603
Until I can prove it, no.

666
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,995
He hasn't been convicted of anything.

667
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,127
What about his mother?

668
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:29,627
His mother has instructed their attorney

669
00:33:29,627 --> 00:33:32,696
that under no circumstances is
her son to receive medication.

670
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:35,281
She's certain it's his wish,
and she's adamant about it.

671
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:37,107
Then we're out of options.

672
00:33:37,107 --> 00:33:41,369
Gilmore walks on murder, and
the witness goes to jail for knifing him.

673
00:33:42,552 --> 00:33:44,257
Rikers...

674
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:47,492
can't be all that comfortable for Mr. Nash.

675
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,048
I can't imagine it's fun for anybody.
Why?

676
00:33:50,048 --> 00:33:54,841
The general population wouldn't
be sensitive to his disease.

677
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:58,240
You want me to cut him a deal
so he can go home.

678
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:03,055
In order to prove self-defense your client
has to testify on his own behalf

679
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:05,128
and I don't see him doing that
without medication.

680
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,392
You have a suspect.

681
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:08,958
Earl Gilmore, ex-con, out on parole.

682
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:12,034
He went up once for armed robbery.
That's why he went in that market.

683
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:14,692
There was no money missing,
so it's just conjecture...

684
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:17,867
unless I get a lucid statement
from your client saying otherwise.

685
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,616
- My client refuses medication.
- Then he's going to prison.

686
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:22,878
I've got him cold for assault one.

687
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:24,727
What are you selling, Ms. Cabot?

688
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:29,491
I'll rule it justifiable in exchange
for a statement about the entire event.

689
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:32,537
You want him on medication.

690
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:36,523
An injection of an anti-psychotic
that'll last about a month.

691
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:37,423
Risks?

692
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:41,769
Without psychiatric care, Mr. Nash
will be ill equipped to deal with reality.

693
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:44,353
And any medication carries
the risk of side effects.

694
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:46,781
Why such a long-acting injection?

695
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:49,471
If I need Mr. Nash for trial,
he's medicated.

696
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:52,056
If I get a confession from Gilmore,
the drug will wear off

697
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,997
and he could go back to his psychosis
if that's what he still wants.

698
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:58,178
No. No.

699
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:00,075
No.

700
00:35:00,774 --> 00:35:03,648
I think you just got your answer.

701
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:17,700
Who did that to your face, Mr. Nash?

702
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:23,195
Would you like to go home?

703
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:26,409
Yes. I want to go home.

704
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:32,937
You have to agree to take your medication,
or you have to stay here.

705
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:43,170
I'll take the medication.

706
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:03,769
I'd rather talk to you guys anyway.

707
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:06,451
Gonna do a lineup or something?

708
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:08,852
No, you picked him out of the photos.
No question.

709
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:10,890
That guy shanked you.

710
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:12,243
But he tells a different story,

711
00:36:12,243 --> 00:36:16,065
so we were wondering if you wanted
to amend your statement.

712
00:36:17,196 --> 00:36:20,042
You're going to listen to
a nut job over me?

713
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:23,445
You said when you entered the store
you didn't see anything right away,
is that correct?

714
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:25,413
- Yeah.
- You went to get a six-pack.

715
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:28,574
That's when you see the guy behind
the counter over the victim, right?

716
00:36:28,574 --> 00:36:30,430
That's what I told you.

717
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,045
So why didn't he just shoot you?

718
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,099
He came after me.

719
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,712
I ran, ducking between the aisles.

720
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,400
Maybe he couldn't get a shot off.
I don't know.

721
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,041
Is that when he stabbed you
in the back? / Yeah.

722
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,765
Hurt like a bitch, too.

723
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:46,130
- You buy that?
- Yeah.

724
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,126
What if you're our perp?
You get stabbed, there's a big struggle.

725
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:50,578
Somehow you manage to escape.

726
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:53,022
You've lost a lot of blood
you collapse, crawl to the street

727
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:56,775
because you've got to get rid of the gun
put it in the trash, that was smart.

728
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:58,810
I don't know, Munch.
If I'm Gilmore and I got a gun...

729
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,170
why don't I just shoot the guy
with the knife?

730
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,714
He thinks he's alone.

731
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:04,599
Clerk's dead,
so he put the gun in his pocket

732
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,125
but when he got attacked he couldn't
get to it, fending off knife blows from behind.

733
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,659
How's that sound?

734
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:11,740
I want a lawyer.

735
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:20,856
- Don't give my son anything.
- Mrs. Nash, he agreed to this.

736
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:22,295
Because you forced him.

737
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:24,435
You already know what happened
in the market that night.

738
00:37:24,435 --> 00:37:26,181
Mark's done nothing wrong.

739
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:27,374
Why are you doing this?

740
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:29,599
Ma'am, because he is
the witness to Maggie's death.

741
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,733
We can't make our case without him.

742
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:33,748
So you treat him like a criminal.

743
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:35,330
You never asked him.

744
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:39,310
You hold a gun to his head and you
have the audacity to say that he agreed.

745
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,741
Prison or this.

746
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,275
Mark, you don't have to do this...

747
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:49,795
Mom. / I'll figure something out.

748
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:54,120
They told me... / I will find a way
to keep you out of jail.

749
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,409
I can't go back.

750
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,773
The bars.
There's microwaves in the bars,

751
00:37:57,773 --> 00:37:59,849
so they can read your mind.

752
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:01,949
They put razors in the food.
I spit up blood.

753
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,100
He signed an agreement.

754
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,705
He didn't know what he was doing.

755
00:38:05,705 --> 00:38:10,200
You would have to get a competency
hearing to supersede his rights.

756
00:38:12,027 --> 00:38:15,655
Months. It would take months.

757
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:17,948
I talked to Maggie.

758
00:38:17,948 --> 00:38:20,639
She told me she wanted to die.

759
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:22,552
You cut me!

760
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:46,301
Show me your cards.

761
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:49,866
Seven years in prison
turned your client into a sexual predator.

762
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:52,035
Really? How do you prove it?

763
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:55,716
I find and put every man
he raped in prison on the stand.

764
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:57,712
Not without making a lot of deals.

765
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:59,614
I don't think the public
would appreciate it.

766
00:38:59,614 --> 00:39:01,531
- Next?
- He was at the scene.

767
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:03,846
He likes to shop there. So what?

768
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:06,545
So I've got a potential witness.

769
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,168
And what else?

770
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:10,166
- DNA.
- Not possible.

771
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,267
Your client is a very stupid man.

772
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,728
Who you calling stupid,
you scum-sucking bitch?

773
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:19,198
Plead to life now...

774
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:21,501
or wait for my witness's statement

775
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:25,206
and end up with a potassium
chloride cocktail.

776
00:39:27,988 --> 00:39:30,136
Ten minutes.

777
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:35,039
Do you remember
what happened that night?

778
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:39,583
Maggie was killed.

779
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:44,344
Did you see anyone enter the market?

780
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:47,162
No.

781
00:39:47,657 --> 00:39:50,754
I usually stayed in the cold case.

782
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,576
I like beer.

783
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:58,079
I heard a loud pop.

784
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,831
That's when I saw the guy.

785
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:04,002
He was standing over Maggie.

786
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,782
Her pants were down,
but she wasn't moving.

787
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:13,144
Did you see him rape her?

788
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,653
No.

789
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,903
But I know he did it.

790
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:22,904
He was exposed.

791
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:28,489
He was searching through
her pockets...

792
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:31,553
Iooking for the keys to the safe.

793
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:34,046
Where's the safe?

794
00:40:34,046 --> 00:40:37,540
It's in the floor behind the counter.

795
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:40,502
I didn't know if Maggie was still alive.

796
00:40:40,502 --> 00:40:43,960
That's when I grabbed the knife
and stabbed him.

797
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:47,039
Did he have a gun?

798
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,999
I saw the bulge.
It was in his pocket.

799
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:57,083
He lifted his hands to fight me
so I stabbed him lower.

800
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:02,741
When he went down, I went to Maggie.
I didn't see him leave.

801
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,210
Mark...

802
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,726
was Maggie already dead?

803
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:18,858
I couldn't let anyone see her like that.

804
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:21,718
I know she wouldn't have liked it.

805
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:25,903
So I did what I could...

806
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,854
and then I had to get away.

807
00:41:30,163 --> 00:41:32,364
Why didn't you call the police?
Why didn't you wait?

808
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,458
For what?

809
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,890
My friend was dead.

810
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:40,483
He did that to her...

811
00:41:40,483 --> 00:41:43,402
and she didn't yell for me.

812
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:47,448
While he brutalized her...

813
00:41:47,448 --> 00:41:50,205
threatened her with a gun...

814
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:53,352
she didn't make a sound.

815
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:56,741
Not once.

816
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:04,814
Deal's off the table.

817
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,328
Your client's headed for death row.

818
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:07,943
That's up to a jury.

819
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:10,922
For my sake and yours,
don't talk to anybody.

820
00:42:10,922 --> 00:42:12,563
Please stand up.

821
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,593
What's going on?

822
00:42:13,593 --> 00:42:15,622
See you in court.

823
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:20,699
Earl Gilmore you are charged with the murder
and rape of Maggie Sandomir.

824
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:29,591
When I said I'd have dinner with you,
I thought we might be sitting.

825
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,495
We'll sit in the car.

826
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,452
- You're a classy guy, you know that?
- Yes, I am.

827
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:35,882
Yeah, I do. You know something?

828
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:36,794
I'm paying for it.

829
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:39,673
It's on me, don't worry.
Stabler.

830
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:44,864
- Be right there.
- What?

831
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:47,133
Here. Let's go to the hospital.

832
00:42:50,744 --> 00:42:53,649
I'm Dr. Warner.
You the SVU detectives?

833
00:42:53,649 --> 00:42:56,769
Yeah, Stabler. This is Benson.
What happened?

834
00:42:56,769 --> 00:42:59,177
Strangulation.

835
00:42:59,908 --> 00:43:02,757
Belt around the neck
and hospital bed post.

836
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:04,653
He asphyxiated.

837
00:43:04,653 --> 00:43:06,819
Very effective.

838
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:13,012
Why would he...

839
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:14,193
The meds made him lucid.

840
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:16,851
But with the voices gone,
so were his friends.

841
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:20,766
Loneliness led to depression
and then to suicide.

842
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:24,738
You can't face a reality
you're not used to living in.

843
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,795
His parents been contacted?

844
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:31,156
His mother's coming down
to ID the body.

845
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:51,200
Mrs. Nash...

846
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:54,833
I'm so sorry.

847
00:43:57,336 --> 00:43:59,417
Go to hell.

848
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:04,561
