1
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,015
In the criminal
justice system...

2
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,854
sexually based offenses

3
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,723
are considered
especially heinous.

4
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,262
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

5
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,094
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

6
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,793
are members of an elite squad

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,495
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

8
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,332
These are their stories.

9
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,416
So you going Britney Spears
on me now or what?

10
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,815
Eartha Kitt.

11
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,514
Who?

12
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,591
I gotta run.

13
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,121
Hi. Where's Mom?

14
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,191
Took the twins to Joey Stemple's
birthday party. That your boyfriend?

15
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,167
No.

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,260
Introduce me.

17
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,326
No.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,408
How long has he been
out of prison?

19
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,597
Dad, stop.

20
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,768
What's his name?

21
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,368
Ryan Witherspoon.

22
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,504
Witherspoon?

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,172
He go to your school?

24
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,478
He's going to post
next year, okay?

25
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,288
Okay, I guess he's cute.

26
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,452
On the LIE
a multi-vehicle accident

27
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,996
just before
the mid-town tunnel...

28
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,088
has traffic clogged up...

29
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,192
Is that a tattoo?

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,159
No.

31
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,833
Where'd you get it?

32
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,374
Well, you've got tattoos.

33
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,637
I was 18 and in the service.

34
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,007
It's henna. It washes off.

35
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,644
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

36
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,618
I just did.
You're such a cop.

37
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,651
Yeah, wait till you have kids.

38
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,551
All the little Witherspoons.

39
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,064
Move.

40
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,498
Stay here, lock the doors,
roll up that window.

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,915
Stabler, Manhattan SVU,
watch yourself.

42
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,250
Hurry up, there's someone
under there.

43
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,385
Get it out!

44
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,826
All right, call it in,
secure the scene.

45
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,206
Don't look at that.

46
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,874
It's all right.
It's all right.

47
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,225
Capt. Cragen...

48
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,333
one of your detectives
reports while bar hopping...

49
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,336
picking up a suspect
and having sex with him.

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,675
Another confesses to fantasies
about killing suspects.

51
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,274
Just what kind of unit
are you running, Captain?

52
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,544
I was told that,
whatever the results...

53
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,682
that, the actual content of these
psych evaluations would be kept private.

54
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,452
Doctor-patient privilege
is sacrosanct.

55
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,893
Promiscuity
and fantasies of murder?

56
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,557
Detectives Jeffries and Stabler
will undergo further evaluation...

57
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,968
and will submit formal
explanations to this committee.

58
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,708
I have assigned prosecutor A.D.A.
Cabot to adjudicate SVU cases.

59
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,809
You will apprise A.D.A. Cabot
of your case file asap.

60
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,514
If I...
Robbery unit next.

61
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,775
Capt. Cragen?

62
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,786
Miss Cabot.

63
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,753
Alex.

64
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,483
Yeah, right, of course.

65
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,262
Let's not start off
on the wrong foot.

66
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,766
My assignment to SVU preceded the
behavioral problems under your command.

67
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,391
Behavioral problems?

68
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,992
I'm trying to be polite.

69
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,503
Tiptoeing around
the road kill?

70
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,560
Where there's smoke.

71
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,607
Who do you sleep with,
Miss Cabot?

72
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,074
Are you so new at this...

73
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,135
that you haven't run into somebody
you'd like to skip due process with?

74
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,579
I'll apprise you asap
if asap can be tomorrow.

75
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,641
You understand,
I have behavioral issues.

76
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,947
Certainly.

77
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,121
Breakfast, then?

78
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,221
Two unis and a robbery
detective from the 17

79
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,784
were kicked over
to Public Affairs.

80
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,056
Reevaluation stinks.

81
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,395
Truly. Best crime stats in 30
years and they're reevaluating?

82
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,492
It's how it works. We get rid
of the criminals they fear...

83
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,593
they start fearing us.

84
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,638
Public hates tough cops,
until they need one.

85
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,970
Jeffries, my office.

86
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,880
You told the psychologist
you slept with a suspect?

87
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,849
What? No, that's not
what I said.

88
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,386
Well, that's how
they interpreted it.

89
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,879
I'm gonna limit
your field time.

90
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,514
You're giving me desk duty?

91
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,994
You need time to prepare a formal
response for the Morris Commission.

92
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,723
I am not explaining my sex
life to the Morris Commission!

93
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,732
That's enough! I don't
like it either, Monique...

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,234
but yelling at me is
not gonna solve anything.

95
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,132
Jimmy Buffet in town?

96
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,436
I was taking Maureen home
from the beach...

97
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,948
see two uniforms fighting this
fire up by Black Bank Marsh.

98
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,004
I stop to help...

99
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,574
turns out to be a body,
gunshot wound to the head...

100
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:30,088
flames leaping off the crotch.
My daughter sees the whole thing.

101
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,145
Is she all right?

102
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,852
I don't know, Kathy picked her
up. I was on the scene all night.

103
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,257
In Queens?

104
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,691
Dump job. Looks like the victim
was shot in his West Side apartment.

105
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:40,999
Elliot.

106
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,091
Off to a scene.

107
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,157
Now.

108
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,863
You okay?

109
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,578
What possessed you to tell the
shrink in your psych evaluation...

110
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,510
that you fantasized
about killing suspects?

111
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,571
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

112
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,817
I said perps not suspects.

113
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,083
Well, the Morris Commission doesn't
see a distinction. They're inquiring.

114
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,891
Inquiring into what?
My private thoughts?

115
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,395
They're supposed to be house-cleaning
the department of rogue cops.

116
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,269
My job at risk?

117
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,498
Yeah.

118
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,508
Victim's Andrew Croft, 42.

119
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,951
Dumped vehicle may be a Lexus. DMV
has one registered to this address...

120
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:35,988
it's missing.

121
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,317
Was he packing or unpacking?

122
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,085
He was transferred here
a month ago...

123
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,023
by his new company,
Radial Velocity.

124
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,117
Radial Velocity?

125
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,093
Yeah.

126
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,790
Edge-of-the-envelope defense
contractor? What's he do for them?

127
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,164
I'm still on his home life. He's
single, lived with his son, Michael...

128
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,295
approximately 16. Neighbors
say that they argued a lot.

129
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,207
Serious feng shui problem.
Neighbors hear this argument?

130
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,543
Everyone was out.
Beach, the park.

131
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,809
This the son?

132
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,779
Probably an old picture. I found
some books labeled MacArthur High...

133
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,345
so I called, but there's
no Michael Croft registered...

134
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,448
but the books are
all bar coded.

135
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,220
I'll take Radial Velocity with Jeffries
if Cragen will let her out of the office.

136
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,227
What?

137
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,763
Morris Commission.

138
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,761
Okay, what the hell's
going on?

139
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,892
The psych evaluation?

140
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:23,936
Yeah?

141
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,665
I said I felt like
killing child molesters.

142
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,832
Okay, so how can they
have a problem with that?

143
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,136
The commissions are all cops.

144
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,198
Yeah, well...

145
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,474
when was the last time one of
them stood in a room like this?

146
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,746
This belonged
to Michael Croft?

147
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,753
This is Michael Goren's book,
he's absent today.

148
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,282
You want to speak to his
guidance counselor, Miss Scheider.

149
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,484
Okay, thank you.

150
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,987
I need a release
from Michael's guardian

151
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,086
to give you his file.

152
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,791
Mrs. Scheider, Michael's
father was murdered yesterday.

153
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,299
Mr. Croft?
Yes.

154
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,660
Mr. Croft wasn't
Michael's father.

155
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,171
Foster parent?
Guardian.

156
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,730
You can see the problem with
getting his signature then.

157
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,538
Right. This is terrible.

158
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,101
What happened
to Michael's parents?

159
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,170
I don't know.
He was born in Belgium...

160
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,237
that's all that's there.

161
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,647
You have a current photo
of him?

162
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,517
No, Michael's a new student. We don't
take school pictures until homecoming.

163
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,680
He's an AIB student.

164
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,623
He could be a straight A
student if he made an effort.

165
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,681
Why, is he lazy?

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,886
Withdrawn.

167
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,328
I feel like Michael's in some pain that
makes him gravitate to troublemakers.

168
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,626
Yeah? Like who?

169
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,462
Primarily, Jason Sloane.

170
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,595
What's with
the beach bum look?

171
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,400
It's casual Monday.

172
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,833
Cops do that?

173
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,307
Michael Goren.
You know where he is?

174
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,941
I don't know.

175
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,707
When was the last time
you saw Michael?

176
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,112
Saturday. He stayed
at my house.

177
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,513
So you guys are close?

178
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,485
No, but he hates going home to the
creep, and I've got an extra bed.

179
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,850
What creep?

180
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,354
Andrew.

181
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,788
Andrew was shot yesterday,
he's dead.

182
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,621
Excellent.

183
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,332
Well, he was a bad guy. I've
seen him slap Michael around.

184
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,458
So where's Michael now?

185
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,059
Didn't I say I don't know?

186
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,798
You don't know where he is, but
you're the only friend he's got?

187
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,137
He has friends. Some girl
calls him from wherever.

188
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,534
Wherever?

189
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,136
Yeah. Wherever.

190
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,377
I'd love to help you do your job,
but I'm a high school student.

191
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,051
Thanks.

192
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,829
Detectives. I'm Craig Prince.

193
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,922
I was Andrew Croft's
supervisor. This is Ralph Noble.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,932
Security.

195
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,798
It's a sad day for us.

196
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:42,396
I wish I could say more. Anyway, this
is everything from Croft's office...

197
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,703
except what's classified.

198
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,937
Was Mr. Croft's job
classified?

199
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,708
He was a guidance system
analyst, that's all I can say.

200
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,009
He just transferred here.

201
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,413
Can't be more specific.

202
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,884
Who was to be notified
in case of an emergency?

203
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,046
Detective, it's classified.

204
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,019
Please, the man
had a son.

205
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,058
If something happens,
who looks out for him?

206
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,650
That's not our concern.

207
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,820
Do we have to get
a court order?

208
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,255
Well, you can try.

209
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,061
What are the odds
you have a picture...

210
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,932
of Senator Joseph McCarthy
tattooed on your ass?

211
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,032
Leave the dolly in the garage.

212
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,310
Radial Velocity's redacted
1,200 pages of documents...

213
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,747
down to
the occasional adverb.

214
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,513
There's not a complete sentence
in anything Craig Prince gave us.

215
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,883
It is national security.

216
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,319
We're looking
for a murderer...

217
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,755
and the victim's missing kid
and Craig Prince is giving us:

218
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,486
"Here's your hat,
what's your hurry?"

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,892
You'd think they'd want to
help us catch Croft's killer...

220
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,931
instead of burying everything under
the rubric of national security.

221
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,866
It's too convenient, there's
something else going on here.

222
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:46,302
It's Munch. No, I want to see
your spook ass now.

223
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,676
What do you want, Munch?

224
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,803
Anything I can get...

225
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,904
on a couple of missile geeks
from Radial Velocity.

226
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:56,879
Who?

227
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:57,938
Craig Prince.

228
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,415
He's no geek,
he's a suit.

229
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,009
Well, what's his story?

230
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,247
We've been looking
at Prince.

231
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,219
Why?

232
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,757
Kickbacks. Guy's living
way beyond his paycheck.

233
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,090
New co-op on Central Park
West, new A8 in the garage.

234
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,322
He disperses classified money.

235
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,458
Ralph Noble?

236
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,968
Head of security.

237
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,739
Yeah?

238
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,603
Vietnam vet, Purple Heart...

239
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,872
Silver Star,
Medal of Honor.

240
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,206
Anything else?

241
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,512
He was hoping for an Oscar,
but he's not in show business.

242
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,981
Man's a war hero, Munch.

243
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,483
Andrew Croft?

244
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,510
Guidance systems. This guy's
the king of the missile geeks...

245
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,816
but I got nothing.
Croft's a black hole.

246
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,186
Who does that?

247
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,455
DOD, NSA.

248
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,895
Why?

249
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,326
We can fire a missile off
a ship in the Gulf of Oman.

250
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,530
20 minutes
and 600 miles later,

251
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,903
it's entering the front door
of a Hezbollah safe house...

252
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,467
in Al Basrah, doesn't even
touch the doorframe.

253
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:05,373
Anybody can build a bomb, Munch,
but nobody delivers them like we do.

254
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,078
Guidance systems, John.

255
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,087
What are we willing
to pay for them?

256
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,716
Anything. Erase your enemies,
erase your past.

257
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,327
Like I said,
Croft's a black hole.

258
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,054
Why the interest?

259
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,393
Croft's dead.

260
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,926
Michael, his 16-year-old ward is
missing. Prince and Noble aren't talking.

261
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,900
How'd Croft buy it?

262
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,602
Bullet to the head,
Bunsen to the crotch.

263
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,644
Ouch.

264
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,837
Yeah.

265
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,526
What's the matter?

266
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,790
The fire.

267
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,622
Come here.

268
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,133
The fire, Daddy, the fire.

269
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,903
It's okay, it's all right.

270
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:09,211
Look, the recidivism rate for rapists
and child molesters is far more onerous...

271
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,875
than that of murderers.
The public knows that.

272
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,419
The public cares
about victims' rights.

273
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,855
And live victims give better
sound bites than dead ones.

274
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,581
They vote, too.

275
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,486
I don't.

276
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,364
I used to, but, well,
look at the choices.

277
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,629
I don't much care for
city politics these days.

278
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,796
The mollifying,
the scapegoating.

279
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,606
That's why there's a Morris
Commission. That's why you're at SVU.

280
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,610
I gotta tell you
something, Alex.

281
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,073
I really don't see
why I should trust you.

282
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,244
Captain.

283
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:51,422
I intend to stand on your shoulders
to reach a broader Constituency.

284
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,884
Why would I do anything
to shorten my grasp?

285
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,522
Okay.

286
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,764
Maybe this could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

287
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,727
Our open cases.

288
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,463
According to the M.E.,
Andrew Croft was killed...

289
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,838
by a. 38 slug, behind
the left ear, point-blank.

290
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,934
Burning was post mortem.

291
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,069
You got a weapon?

292
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,943
It hasn't turned up yet,
but Croft owned a. 38.

293
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,307
What about the boy?

294
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,817
Still missing,
along with Croft's Lexus.

295
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,284
Maybe the kid is dead.

296
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,684
Why do you say that?

297
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,216
My contact at the G says that
Croft's supervisor, Craig Prince...

298
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,657
is being looked at
for kickbacks.

299
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,784
So what?

300
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,796
Well, maybe Croft had evidence,
maybe Croft was involved...

301
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,331
and they had
a lethal disagreement.

302
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,696
Looks like sexual homicide...

303
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,791
not an assassination.

304
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,597
Very clever,
to throw us off track.

305
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,071
I gotta hand it to you. When you go with
a theory, you really go with a theory.

306
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,698
You think this stuff
doesn't happen?

307
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,764
No, I'm not saying...

308
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,070
Let's just keep our heads...

309
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,338
in the game here, all right?

310
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,075
Now the connection between Prince and
Croft warrants further investigation.

311
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,617
But in the meantime, we've
still got a missing kid...

312
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,485
and until I know otherwise, I'm
going to assume he's still alive.

313
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,688
Now you guys, find the Lexus,
find the boy.

314
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:03,660
Munch, Jeffries, let's find out
how good this new ADA really is.

315
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,220
We need a search warrant
for Radial Velocity.

316
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,959
You want me to secure
a search warrant

317
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,900
for the offices
of a defense contractor...

318
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,405
to search classified national
security files for evidence...

319
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,100
in a sexually
motivated homicide?

320
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,836
Yes, you got a problem
with that?

321
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,437
Judge Harriman, please. This is
Alex Cabot in the DA's office.

322
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,415
Uncle Bill? Good.

323
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,049
Look, I need a little favor.

324
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,649
You've got to be
kidding me.

325
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,418
You said we should try.

326
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,719
You do not just barge in here
without proper notice.

327
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,957
Read the fine print. Now step aside, or
I'll have these officers restrain you.

328
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:52,307
Great, thank you. That was the state
police. We've located Croft's Lexus...

329
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,676
upstate Millbrook,
right outside Poughkeepsie.

330
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,544
Croft transferred
from Poughkeepsie.

331
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,515
Locals are surveilling it
till we get there.

332
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,573
Great. Find something.

333
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,158
Blood. Pop it.

334
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:14,723
Nobody home. House belongs
to Richard and Darlene Sadler.

335
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,268
They own a hardware store
over on Elm street.

336
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,998
Their daughter, Denise,
attends the high school.

337
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,903
Well, looks like we found
the girlfriend from wherever.

338
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,447
Slow down!

339
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,853
Denise is in
her fourth period class.

340
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,892
We were hoping that she might be
able to help us locate Michael Goren.

341
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,018
Leave the spurs home
next time.

342
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,461
Great kid Michael.
What do you mean locate?

343
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,499
He's been missing
since Sunday.

344
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,559
Michael's not missing.
He's in our mentoring program.

345
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,939
Let's go, Jimmy. Nice Job. Good
job. All right, everybody...

346
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,945
just like Jimmy,
use the inside of your foot.

347
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,310
Michael.

348
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,847
This is about Andrew,
isn't it?

349
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,291
Do you understand
these rights?

350
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,293
Yes.

351
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,889
Do you understand that you don't have
to talk to us without your lawyer?

352
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,633
I wanna talk.

353
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,098
Go ahead.

354
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,772
I killed him.

355
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,308
He hit me, I hit him back.

356
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,309
First time I did that,
he went crazy...

357
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,648
got his gun,
said he was gonna kill me.

358
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,018
I tackled him and then
I heard this loud pop.

359
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,455
When I looked down,
he was laying there...

360
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,794
dead.

361
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,793
Then what?

362
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,098
I wrapped him in the sheets
and dragged him to the car.

363
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,375
The next thing I knew
I was driving back home.

364
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,409
To Millbrook?

365
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,541
Yes.

366
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,449
Michael, what's going on?

367
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,652
It's nothing.

368
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,489
I'm okay, Denise.
It's okay.

369
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,587
This can't be right.

370
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,995
Step back...
Not Michael.

371
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,795
Step back, people,
give us a little room please.

372
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,329
Michael, we're all
behind you on this.

373
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,173
Give us a little room,
please.

374
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,047
What are you doing? They got
a confession, made an arrest.

375
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,052
That can all go back
to Radial Velocity.

376
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,052
Too tidy.

377
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,214
Can't stand letting go
of a theory, can you?

378
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,121
It's not theory, Olivia.

379
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,126
Confession, next case.
I don't buy it.

380
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,162
Heat of the moment murder
is one thing...

381
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,527
but taking time to set fire
to the victim's crotch.

382
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,895
What'd you call that, Elliot?

383
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,831
Sexually motivated homicide.

384
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,836
You bet. Perpetrated by a child
on a guardian. Text book...

385
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,101
except for the little matter of the
blank pages, thanks to Radial Velocity.

386
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,165
I want to know
where they stand on this deal.

387
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,437
Me, too.

388
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,871
You have an appointment.

389
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,642
Look, Captain, you know, this
time of day, Skodas' office...

390
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,875
it's gotta be
an hour drive.

391
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,145
Elliot,
this is must do, now.

392
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,017
The good news is that
he's around the corner...

393
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,181
doing some outreach work
at Christ's Church.

394
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,623
He's happy to see you now.
Thank you.

395
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,356
I'm not talking to you.

396
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,955
Fine.

397
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,691
I'll just sit here.

398
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:40,295
You know, I may lose my job because
of the last shrink I talked to.

399
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,706
Why?

400
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,367
Because she violated
her ethical obligation...

401
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,035
to keep my confidence.

402
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,972
If we believe a patient might do violence
to someone, we're legally bound to...

403
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,539
I have never done violence
to anyone.

404
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,811
Why would she think you would?

405
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,220
Ask her.

406
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,151
Det. Stabler,
we've talked before.

407
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,725
Come on, give me the benefit
of the doubt, will you?

408
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,928
I'm sorry,
I haven't slept a lot lately.

409
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,997
Why not?

410
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,164
I'm worried
about losing my job.

411
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,272
I'm angry.

412
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,402
At?

413
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,544
Are we really gonna
do this dance again?

414
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,951
I mean, what do you want me to say?
That I fantasized about killing the perp?

415
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,011
Did you?

416
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,613
Yeah, you're damn right
I did...

417
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,751
and this time I fed him my gun
and I pulled that trigger.

418
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,289
Until I caught him and then
there he is, he's just...

419
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:43,960
He's a kid, he's a good kid. He
tutors Down syndrome children.

420
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,731
He's a straight A student,
he's a star athlete...

421
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,104
he's Millbrook township's
favorite son.

422
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,377
Now how that jives
with cold-blooded murder...

423
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,445
How long have you been
on the force?

424
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,785
14 years.

425
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,619
In all those years, how many
murders have actually made sense?

426
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,687
None. But...

427
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,262
some I understood.

428
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,666
But this one...

429
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,096
you let get
under your skin. Why?

430
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,068
This one, my daughter saw.

431
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,775
Hey, how'd it go?

432
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,015
I talked too much, again.
Where's Jeffries?

433
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,058
Her turn on the couch, and while
you were probing your inner child...

434
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,492
we did some probing of our own.
Sent Croft's prints to NCIC.

435
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,427
You printed the corpse?

436
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,521
So?

437
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,095
And?
Nothing.

438
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,225
So?
I mean nothing, nada, bupkis.

439
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,532
Zip. No parking tickets,
no birth records.

440
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,129
Nothing to prove he
even existed before 1991.

441
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,437
The year he went to work
for Radial Velocity.

442
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,239
So, we're going through the stuff
we got from the search warrant...

443
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,610
we find this passport issued
10 years ago from San Diego.

444
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,809
We call the local PD, ask them
to run him, bang, we get a hit.

445
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,249
But not to Andrew Croft.

446
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,217
Then who?

447
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,551
George Kazinski,
a convicted sexual predator.

448
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,888
Andrew Croft,
a. k. a George Kazinski.

449
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,855
Little George
liked little boys.

450
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,067
Andrew Croft's been
one busy guy.

451
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,333
11 arrests...

452
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,341
five aliases,
four convictions.

453
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,433
How'd you track him?

454
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,446
San Diego PD faxed us his rap sheet. We
followed his priors back from there...

455
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,176
department by department,
conviction by conviction.

456
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,877
Only the feds
can erase a file.

457
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,680
Radial Velocity is the feds.

458
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,722
That's why they're called
a military-industrial complex.

459
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,726
You're accusing the Federal government of
sanctioning the sexual abuse of a child.

460
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,819
Please tell me
you have a motive.

461
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,258
Where did you find these?

462
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,959
That's classified.

463
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,731
There's only a handful of people that can
calibrate the trajectory of a missile...

464
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,434
to within a hair's breadth
of Saddam's mustache.

465
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,442
Andrew Croft was one of them.

466
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,708
Couldn't let a little thing like
pedophilia undermine national security.

467
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,677
If a child is ruined
in the process?

468
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,184
That's not our concern.

469
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,344
Detective...

470
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,322
there are many things that take a back
seat to national security. However...

471
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,955
if I had known Croft was a pedophile,
I never would have hired him.

472
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,553
Right, and there were
no Nazis in NASA.

473
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,525
Mr. Noble will see you out.

474
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,825
You don't talk much,
do you?

475
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,928
Not much fight left
in the old soldier?

476
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,768
Don't you question
my patriotism, mister.

477
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,638
That's Mister Detective
to you.

478
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,109
Take a little bit of tarnish
off that Medal of Honor.

479
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,669
We can find
our own way out, thanks.

480
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,548
Why're you provoking him?

481
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,990
Guy's a war hero. Put his life
on the line for principle.

482
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,652
He's gotta be gagging
stonewalling Croft's pedophilia

483
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:56,887
to protect Radial Velocity.

484
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:00,329
Assuming he still has principles.
War was a long time ago, John.

485
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:04,198
Principles die harder than people.
I want a shot at what's left of his.

486
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,530
Wonder what he's doing
for lunch?

487
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,676
My parents died in a car wreck
when I was eight.

488
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,112
The only other family
I had was Nana.

489
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,207
She was old and in a hospital.

490
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,819
Andrew offered
to take care of me.

491
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:25,819
You're Belgian and Andrew's
American. How did you two hook up?

492
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,491
Andrew used to hang out
at soccer practice.

493
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,618
Whose soccer practice?

494
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,626
Mine.

495
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,356
And this is when you
were 8 years old?

496
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,362
Yeah.

497
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:37,424
He and Dad worked at NATO in
Brussels. Dad was a janitor.

498
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,665
He was proud to have a rocket
scientist as his friend.

499
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,301
Said I was lucky to have such an
important man take an interest in me.

500
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,507
How did he
take an interest?

501
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,373
Andrew said
I was a natural athlete.

502
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,176
Yeah, we saw your trophies.

503
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,082
He got me sailing lessons,
tennis lessons...

504
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,477
My dad couldn't afford them.

505
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,324
After your parents died,
Andrew brought you to America?

506
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:04,621
First Bosnia, Israel,
then Millbrook.

507
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,662
I finally made some friends.

508
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,358
Yeah, you even
had a girlfriend.

509
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,091
Denise.

510
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,363
Bet you weren't too happy
about leaving her.

511
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,962
I never felt like that
about anybody.

512
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,474
I mean, not just her,
her parents...

513
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,478
They felt like a real family.

514
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,675
Michael, did you know
that in 1990...

515
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,186
Andrew was convicted of sexually
assaulting an 11 year-old boy?

516
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:31,947
No.

517
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,760
When was the first time
he assaulted you?

518
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,529
He didn't.
What are you talking about?

519
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:44,160
Well, in my experience, child
molesters, they don't stop.

520
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,929
You were a child.

521
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,198
He didn't touch me!

522
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,604
Michael, you were
in a bad situation.

523
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,665
You're safe now.
You don't have to lie anymore.

524
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,371
I'm not lying! I'm not!

525
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,807
He didn't touch me.

526
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,012
He didn't.

527
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,186
Thanks for the heads up.

528
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,985
I think I've got
the EED defense.

529
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,253
Not unless your client
changes his tune.

530
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,052
Are we working
for the defense now?

531
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,496
Yeah. You don't volunteer to do
hard time because you're embarrassed.

532
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,363
This kid is hiding something.

533
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,262
Okay, maybe an accomplice.

534
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,100
Maybe somebody who scares him
more than Andrew.

535
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,243
At what point did courage and
integrity buckle to income?

536
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,973
Don't ever get in my face
about money.

537
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,413
If I cared about money I
wouldn't have been in the service.

538
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,541
What do you care about?

539
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,142
Protecting the reputation
of a dead pedophile...

540
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,619
part of
national security now?

541
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,656
I'm not protecting
Croft's reputation.

542
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,657
What are you protecting?

543
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,857
Croft's missile guidance expertise
was critical in the Gulf War.

544
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,489
You erase sodomy convictions
for national security?

545
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,624
We didn't erase
his convictions.

546
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,796
What? Is there another way
to say it?

547
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:57,337
Croft's felony record red-flagged
him every time he crossed a border.

548
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,705
A day's delay was a lifetime
in a war moving that fast.

549
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,077
So Radial Velocity
erased his past.

550
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,073
We were depleting
our arsenal of smart bombs...

551
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,210
at more than $1 million
a minute.

552
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,152
At that price the Pentagon
wanted pin-point precision.

553
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,257
A complaint was filed
in the State department.

554
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,783
A firewall was built around Croft
so Immigration wouldn't red-flag him.

555
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,228
When the war ended
the wall should've come down.

556
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,766
I can't tell you why it
didn't, I just don't know!

557
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,699
Meanwhile, a convicted
child molester...

558
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,567
applies for guardianship
of an 8-year-old and...

559
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:32,065
No red flags. I'm sorry.

560
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:40,883
My God!

561
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,476
Eleven arrests,
four convictions...

562
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,613
more than we knew about,
one in Canada.

563
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,658
This is despicable.
Get me Todd Earl at Justice.

564
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,624
Justice?

565
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,388
We need to secure
the chain of evidence.

566
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,896
We didn't bring this to you so
you could make a federal case.

567
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,591
What about Michael?
What about him?

568
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,227
He's a child. A child raised
by a pedophile for eight years.

569
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,134
He was molested.
He denies it.

570
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,639
There's no evidence here
to contradict that denial.

571
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,334
Are you saying
he wasn't abused?

572
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,501
I'm certain he was.

573
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,204
However,
absent Michael's admission...

574
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,405
you're asking me to soft-pedal
premeditated murder.

575
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,108
You're protecting
your won-loss ratio.

576
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,240
Elliot.

577
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,477
It's okay, Captain.

578
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:17,544
Stabler's judgment is clouded by the
stress of the Morris Commission's review.

579
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,581
And the fact that Michael did what he
fantasizes about. Kill a perpetrator.

580
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,157
It's not my fantasy, and I
stand with Det. Stabler on this.

581
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,794
The kid had choices.

582
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,833
He could have walked away,
told a teacher, told a cop.

583
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,429
Instead he murdered.

584
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,834
We let him skate on this...

585
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,901
what kind of choice will he make the
next time he faces an untenable situation?

586
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,682
All right, but either
he corroborates the abuse...

587
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,950
or I ask the grand jury for
an indictment on murder two.

588
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,059
No.

589
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,117
Michael, please...

590
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,220
No.

591
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,125
Michael...

592
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:06,265
Andrew Croft abused at least
11 other children.

593
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,435
He's a sexual predator.

594
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,599
Michael, he can't
hurt you now.

595
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,143
You don't understand.

596
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,503
I won't. I can't.

597
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,207
You're a victim.
No, I'm not!

598
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,549
I'm not! I told you what
happened. I will stay in jail!

599
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,250
I will, but, please,
leave me alone.

600
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,159
It's murder two. He's
returning his own indictment.

601
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,891
Sorry, Captain.

602
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,913
Dad?

603
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,555
What are you doing up?

604
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,387
Couldn't sleep.

605
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,450
What's the matter?
You got nightmares?

606
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,189
You have to sleep
to have nightmares.

607
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,128
Right, what was I thinking?

608
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,557
Want something
to drink?

609
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,657
No.

610
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,559
Dad...

611
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,564
what that boy Michael
did to that man...

612
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,613
That man was supposed
to take care of Michael...

613
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:26,611
and instead he molested him.

614
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,177
He abused him physically, he betrayed
his trust, and I think Michael...

615
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,646
just had enough.

616
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,151
So what happens now?

617
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,286
He's probably gonna
go to prison.

618
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,625
All he's gotta do
is tell the truth.

619
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,164
What is it with you kids?

620
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,232
It's hard to talk
to adults.

621
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:47,994
Why?

622
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,739
You're always judging us. You
expect us to be like you...

623
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,437
and you get mad
if we're not.

624
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,605
It's just easier
to talk to our friends.

625
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,308
What if you
don't have any friends?

626
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,645
Everybody's got friends.

627
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,275
Yeah? Well,
who do you talk to?

628
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,341
Dad.

629
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,546
You talk
to Ryan Witherspoon?

630
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,386
More than you talk to Mom.

631
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,497
Could the wound
have been inflicted

632
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,932
during a struggle for the gun?

633
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:18,991
Not likely.

634
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,230
Why not?

635
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,030
The size
of the entry wound...

636
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,370
the force at which it entered
suggests close range.

637
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,602
But there was no stippling.

638
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,144
Stippling is?

639
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:31,375
When lead leaves the muzzle, it's followed
by the charge that fires it, the gunpowder.

640
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,480
At close range it leaves a residue,
point blank it embeds in the skin.

641
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:36,915
That's stippling.

642
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,612
The size and force of the
entry and the lack of stippling

643
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,022
lead you to conclude?

644
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,619
The gun was three to four feet from
the victim's head when it was fired.

645
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,364
The victim's reach was only 32 inches.
He couldn't have held the gun...

646
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,925
three feet from his skull, much less
fired it into the back of his head.

647
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,868
The body was discovered
wrapped in a sheet.

648
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:58,875
It was blood-soaked from a head wound
and the genital region was on fire.

649
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,303
Where?

650
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,806
In the dunes about 50 yards
off Cross Bay Boulevard...

651
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:08,079
a medical bracelet on the victim indicated
he lived at West 83rd in Manhattan.

652
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,846
Blood splattered the headboard,
wall, and lamp in the master bedroom.

653
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,281
Did the blood pattern
indicate anything to you?

654
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,488
Yes, that the victim had been
shot while lying in the bed.

655
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,894
Any signs of a struggle?

656
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:20,953
No.

657
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,329
Forced entry?

658
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,961
No.

659
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,636
The victim's car
was missing?

660
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,767
State police located it
in Millbrook, New York.

661
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,966
The murder weapon
was found locked in the trunk.

662
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,978
Who had the keys?

663
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,672
Michael Goren.

664
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,178
How'd it go in there?

665
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,816
The kid's toast.

666
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,086
I've been thinking about
something Maureen said last night,

667
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,957
something about friends.

668
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,621
What about them?

669
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,688
You up
for taking a little ride?

670
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,463
Denise, how long
were you seeing Michael?

671
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,898
What should I say?
I really want to help him.

672
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,443
You can help him
by telling us the truth.

673
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,109
We were dating
about three months.

674
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,114
He ever talk
about Andrew?

675
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,106
Denise?

676
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,051
Did he?
Please.

677
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,480
They didn't get along.

678
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:25,927
My dad would let Michael stay in our
spare bedroom when Andrew was out of town.

679
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,197
My parents really liked him.

680
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:34,394
Sometimes Michael lied about Andrew
being gone, so he could stay over.

681
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,996
Did Andrew ever find out?

682
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,633
I think he knew.

683
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,767
He object?

684
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,506
Not after that thing
with Danny.

685
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:44,937
Who's Danny?

686
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,044
Danny Burrell.
Michael's best friend.

687
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,143
What happened?

688
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,482
I don't know.

689
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,681
But it had to be bad.

690
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,055
I mean, one day
they're best friends

691
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,027
and the next day, it's like
they hate each other.

692
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,727
Heads up, Mueller!
Heads up! Danny Burrell!

693
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,427
Yeah?

694
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,969
Front and center.

695
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,936
We're not friends anymore.

696
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,134
Why not?

697
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,705
Guy's weird, that's all.

698
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,507
What do you mean?
Weird, how?

699
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,110
Just weird.

700
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,944
Did Andrew Croft
attack you?

701
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,709
Did Michael
tell you that?

702
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,879
Why don't you tell us
about it?

703
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,684
Man, he swore!

704
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,926
I'm sorry
I can't talk in front of her.

705
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,223
That's okay.

706
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,164
Mike and me played ball.

707
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,167
Okay.

708
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,000
We went to his house
afterwards to clean up.

709
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:46,005
He said that Andrew was gone, so I
used his shower, and when I got out...

710
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,066
he was standing there.

711
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,305
Andrew?

712
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,506
Yeah. He was naked.

713
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,310
He was touching himself.

714
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,156
He wanted to dry me off.

715
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,355
He's just a creep.

716
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,460
Anyway, he said that Michael was too
swarthy but I was perfect for him.

717
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,928
He grabbed me, I fought him
off, I screamed for Mike...

718
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,798
and I finally got the door
open, and Michael was...

719
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,833
He was just standing there.

720
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,802
So, I just grabbed my clothes
and I ran. I forgot my Nikes.

721
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,704
You and Michael talk
after that?

722
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:27,114
No way. I told the guy
to leave me alone.

723
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,680
I think it's disgusting
what he and Andrew were doing.

724
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,654
You think
Michael liked it?

725
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:36,789
What do you think? I mean, Michael's
6 foot, guy benches, what, 220 pounds?

726
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,523
He could kick his ass if he
didn't like him doing him.

727
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,430
He was eight years old
when Andrew started doing him.

728
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,031
Eight-year-olds
can't fight back.

729
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,427
Now you tell me where a
16 year-old's gonna turn...

730
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,370
when his best friend
turns on him?

731
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,850
You said the gun went off
in the midst of a struggle?

732
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:01,907
Yes.

733
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:05,387
The police found no signs of a
struggle. How do you explain that?

734
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,488
I don't know.

735
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,254
That's because there was
no struggle, was there?

736
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,556
We struggled.

737
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,596
Over the gun?

738
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,028
Yes.
And it went off?

739
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,030
Yes.

740
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,088
In both your hands?

741
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,156
Yes.

742
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:21,101
The Coroner found no trace of
gunpowder on the deceased's hands.

743
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,104
I told you
what happened.

744
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,134
Who is Danny Burrell?

745
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,308
He's my friend.

746
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,787
Did you witness the deceased
sexually assault Danny Burrell?

747
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,279
No!

748
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,319
Danny will testify the
deceased sexually assaulted him

749
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,058
and that you witnessed it.

750
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,929
Are you saying
he's lying?

751
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,898
Did Andrew Croft sexually
assault Danny Burrell?

752
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:03,502
Yes.

753
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,511
And you, too?

754
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,852
Since I was eight.

755
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,527
You shot him to stop him
from molesting you?

756
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,590
No!

757
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,999
I hated it,
but I was used to it.

758
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,800
I shot him because he was
bringing over his friend.

759
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,906
What friend?

760
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,946
In Millbrook, this guy
came up sometimes.

761
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,724
Andrew made me
do things with him.

762
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,891
When we moved here,
I thought it was over.

763
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,028
But then I come home
from school and he's there!

764
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,263
I mean we moved right
across the street from him!

765
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,939
Andrew was bad enough,
but both of them...

766
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,137
I begged him.

767
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,752
Who is this man?

768
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,586
He'll kill me.

769
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,062
He can't hurt you.

770
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,228
You don't know his powers.

771
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:34,268
Michael, you're in the custody of the
City of New York. He can't get to you.

772
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,203
He can get to anybody.

773
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,235
And he will
to protect his secret.

774
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,906
A child molester only has power
as long as his secret is kept.

775
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,576
You tell the truth, his power is
gone. What's his name, Michael?

776
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,279
I heard them talk about it.
Nobody did anything.

777
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,323
Talk about what?
Who, Michael?

778
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,660
Andrew and...

779
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,996
and Craig Prince.

780
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,738
They killed that boy in
Belgium and nobody did anything!

781
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,177
When did this happen?
What boy?

782
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,703
I was eight.
It was in the papers there.

783
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,681
Nobody did anything.

784
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,752
Craig Prince can get away
with anything.

785
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,886
You're gonna protect me?

786
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,460
Write-offs in the third
quarter adjusted by the...

787
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,292
Craig, good news!

788
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,770
Excuse me,
this is a classified briefing.

789
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,433
Yeah, Croft's ward, Michael.

790
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,807
The grand jury voted man two.
DA's willing to cut him a deal.

791
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,209
I don't see
what that has to do...

792
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,009
Even better news,
you're under arrest...

793
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,448
for sexual abuse, sodomy, assault and
endangering the welfare of a child.

794
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,780
You're hurting me!

795
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,184
Not our concern.

796
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,688
Craig Prince, you have
the right to remain silent.

797
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:03,887
If you give up that right, anything you
do or say can and will be used against you.

798
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,685
Capt. Cragen?

799
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,583
This little boy's mother stuck his hands on
a frying pan until his fingers burned off.

800
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,093
This rape victim...

801
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,886
required 12 hours of surgery to
have a steel plate into her head...

802
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,934
after her attacker pummeled
her with a claw hammer.

803
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,501
This one didn't make it.

804
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:01,278
Is there anybody on this panel who
doesn't share Det. Stabler's anger...

805
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,910
for the perpetrators?

806
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,246
This man is a good cop.

807
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,159
As his commanding officer,
I stand with him...

808
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,788
and every good cop who faces
these horrors day after day...

809
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,731
and has the strength to
keep their impulses in check.

810
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,031
Now if you can look at these
pictures and not understand that...

811
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:26,241
the problem here
isn't Elliot Stabler, is it?

812
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,413
Yeah, that's done.

813
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,385
Hello?

814
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,184
All right, yeah, go get
the kids dinner... Yeah.

815
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,150
Kathleen!
Sure.

816
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,821
Dickie, Elizabeth, dinner's ready!
All right tomorrow. Captain...

817
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,753
thanks for the support.

818
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:54,996
Well?

819
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,973
The Morris Commission
cleared me.

820
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
Capt. Cragen?

821
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,018
Not now.

822
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,927
Monique Jeffries.
Maybe I can help?

823
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,331
Fin Tutuola,
I've been re-assigned.

824
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,933
You're here for my job.

825
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,140
This is awkward.

826
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,699
Well, try my side
of the moment.
