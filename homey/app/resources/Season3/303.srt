00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:00,197
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

2
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,636
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

3
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:05,099
In New York City,

4
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:08,143
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

5
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:11,669
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

6
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,545
These are their stories,

7
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,217
Excuse me,
where's the baby formula?

8
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:20,221
It's around the corner.
I'II show you.

9
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:29,224
These are on sale.
My brand. Great.

10
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:31,095
Thanks.
No problem.

11
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:40,439
Emma? My baby!
Where's my baby?

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,308
What's wrong?
Oh, God!
Somebody stole my baby!

13
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,475
Stay right here.
Emma! Emma!

14
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:50,508
Baby girl, six weeks,
name's Emma Daricek.

15
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:53,680
White undershirt,
one piece Iong-sleeve
red jumper,

16
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:55,553
purple socks and sweater,
white booties.

17
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,887
Enough brown hair
for a pink bow.

18
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,517
How Iong did the mother
Ieave the kid alone?

19
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:00,789
She swears it was
Iess than seconds.
That's all it takes.

20
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:02,728
The store have a protocol
for missing kids?

21
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,461
Security says it took
about three minutes
to close off all the exits.

22
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:06,866
We're searching
aisle by aisle now,

23
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,928
getting names and addresses
of employees and customers
before they can Ieave.

24
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:12,065
Okay. How many other mothers
were in here when it happened?

25
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:15,542
Seven. Mrs. Daricek eyeballed
every one of those babies.

26
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:16,805
Where is she now?

27
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,040
Back in the manager's office
beating herself up.

28
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:21,515
Husband's on his way.
STABLER: Witnesses?

29
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:23,641
Nobody saw it happen.

30
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,186
Baby snatchers travel Iight.

31
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:28,655
Perp Iifts the kid out
of one cart, sticks her
in another. Two seconds, done.

32
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:30,385
OFFICER: Detectives.
What's up?

33
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,726
Motor Vehicle office down
the street. They found
something in the Iadies' room.

34
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:36,824
What do you got?

35
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:39,060
She found these baby clothes
in the garbage can here.

36
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:41,103
Snatcher probably
disguised the girl as a boy.

37
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,900
Afraid that the baby would
get recognized on the street.
What's all this?

38
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:46,441
OFFICER: We got an eyedropper
and some capsules.

39
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,374
It's Librium.
Sedative.

40
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,878
Perp could be an alcoholic
trying to control the shakes.

41
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:54,280
Dissolve some in water,
feed it to the baby
so she doesn't cry,

42
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,284
calmly walk out of the store.

43
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,980
And then give her a haircut.

44
00:02:47,703 --> 00:02:49,967
I just walked away
for one moment
and she was gone.

45
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,131
How could this happen?

46
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:53,038
Did you notice anyone
in the aisles watching you?

47
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,474
I don't remember...
Did anyone stop to talk?

48
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,273
Well, did anyone
pay unusual attention to Emma?

49
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:59,610
I don't know! Will you stop
asking me questions
and just go find her!

50
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,980
Michele, you gotta
try to calm down
so we can help you...

51
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,541
Calm down? I Ieft her alone!

52
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:06,087
But torturing yourself
isn't going to bring
your daughter back.

53
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,452
Michele!
Tony.

54
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:11,118
Hey. Hang on now.
How did it happen?

55
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:13,253
I took my eyes off her.
I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:14,990
It'II be okay...
It's way past Emma's feeding.

57
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,760
I know she's hungry. PIease.
You've got to find her!

58
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,768
We're doing everything
that we can. May I
speak to you one minute?

59
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:22,997
I'II be right back,
sweetheart.

60
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:24,704
Michele.

61
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,332
TONY: You're gonna
find Emma, right?

62
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,640
Every second counts.
That's why we need your help
to calm your wife down.

63
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:31,839
I've been trying to do that
ever since Emma was born.

64
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:34,041
And what does that mean?

65
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:38,713
One minute everything's okay,
the next Michele's crying
and throwing things.

66
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,850
This is the first time
she's been out of the house
with Emma.

67
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:44,484
I'm worried.
Is your wife
taking any medication?

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,858
I can't even get her
to see a doctor.
I gotta get back there.

69
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:48,624
Mr. Daricek, I have
four children of my own,

70
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:50,495
so I can't even imagine
what you're going through,

71
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,329
but I...
What are you saying?

72
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,137
I don't want to jump
to any conclusions here,

73
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,900
but it sounds Iike your
wife's going through
postpartum depression.

74
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:00,733
Yeah. Okay.
She's stressed out.

75
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,042
Look, if I thought
Emma was in any danger,
I swear I'd take her away.

76
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,514
You think if Michele
harmed her baby she
would be rational enough

77
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,350
to plant the clothes
and hair in the bathroom?

78
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,720
Can't rule it out.
This was pretty well planned.

79
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,554
Felt more Iike
somebody desperate for a baby

80
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:18,753
who couldn't get one
the Iegal way.

81
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:20,352
Well, either way,
the clock is running.

82
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:21,987
We don't find Emma soon,
she's gone for good.

83
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:23,895
That's why I called in
the mobile command post.

84
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,558
We'II save time
working from here, all right?

85
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:29,002
EIIiot, if you think
she knows something,
find out. Fast.

86
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:35,038
Michele, was she wearing
anything else
besides the jumper?

87
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:38,911
It was cold.
She was sleeping
wrapped in a blanket.

88
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,617
Emma cries
when she gets cold.

89
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:45,685
You know, when my
first daughter was born,

90
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,688
I was working the midnight
to 8:00 a.m. shift,

91
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:49,588
my wife worked days.

92
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:53,219
So when I got home
all I wanted to do was sleep,

93
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,898
all my baby
wanted to do was cry.

94
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:04,000
I nearly Iost my mind.
I could barely function.

95
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:07,734
It's so hard.

96
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,172
Michele, I know
what you're going through.

97
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,747
The first baby
is always the toughest.

98
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:22,514
I feel blessed every day
because I have Emma.

99
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,053
I Iove her so much.

100
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,362
Am I ever gonna see her again?

101
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:39,767
(CRYING)

102
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:45,677
We make the proper
notifications?

103
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:48,308
Airports, train
and bus stations
are all covered.

104
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:50,352
Photos of Emma
are going out
to every toll booth

105
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:52,751
and police department
within a 100-mile radius.

106
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:54,756
We're also checking on
any attempted snatchings

107
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:56,257
where the baby's sex
was disguised.

108
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:58,054
Anything from your canvass?

109
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:01,654
Only thing we came up with
is a woman with a suitcase
in her shopping cart.

110
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:05,098
Get with store security,
see what they got
on the videotapes.

111
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:09,732
FIN: You have someone
watching this all day?

112
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:12,205
SECURITY GUARD:
This isn't a Vegas casino.
Here it is.

113
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:15,175
So mom checks out
the merchandise.

114
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:19,437
Mystery shopper Iifts the kid,
and it wasn't the mother.

115
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:21,642
Damn it, can't see her face.

116
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:24,777
This the only angle
you have on this?
Yeah. That part
of the store, yeah.

117
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:28,517
What about the front doors?
We got cameras
on the entrance and exit.

118
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,889
MUNCH: Get the exit tape
from that time of day
and hurry up.

119
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,827
What kind of woman would steal
somebody else's kid?

120
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:37,592
Could be maternal instinct
run amuck or maybe
it's strictly business.

121
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:42,800
Not her. Not her. Not her.

122
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,301
Pause it.

123
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,641
Kid would be screaming
if she was in that suitcase.

124
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,941
Unless she's already
been doped up.

125
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,076
Nobody saw her
take Emma out of the store.

126
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,414
Why risk stopping to change
the baby's appearance?

127
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,385
Nobody's Iooking
for a Iittle boy.

128
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:02,049
EIIiot's still with
the Dariceks. So Iet's rule
Michele out for the moment.

129
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:03,250
Did our mystery Iady...
Thank you.

130
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:04,690
...buy the suitcase
in the store?

131
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,523
About half an hour
before the snatch.

132
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:09,063
Paid with a credit card
in the name of Susan Young.

133
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:12,066
Works downtown
at Social Services.
AII right. Go.

134
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:18,296
My purse was stolen
this morning.
Where?

135
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:20,235
Substance abuse center
where I work.

136
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,470
I filled out a report
at the precinct in Chinatown.

137
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:23,807
You guys found it already?

138
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,746
No, but we think this woman
used one of your credit cards.

139
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:29,182
AIicia.
You know her?

140
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:32,846
I saw her
a couple of hours ago.
She's one of my clients.

141
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:36,185
I don't believe this.
Does she have
access to Librium?

142
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,890
She's not taking it.
She could get some
from someone at the clinic.

143
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:41,987
AIicia's a crack addict.

144
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:45,124
She was doing so well, too.
Hadn't used since
she got pregnant.

145
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:47,362
When did she have the baby?
Last week.

146
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:49,700
Stillborn.
It's a real tragedy.

147
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:52,240
Where does she Iive?
10th Avenue, the 50s.

148
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:54,799
I can call my office,
get the exact address.

149
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:02,912
Start in the kitchen.
Must have found herself
a nice job.

This is different.

297
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:38,228
Oh, my Lord. Come in.

298
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,163
Herbert!
HERBERT: What is it?

299
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:42,726
It's Captain Cragen.

300
00:16:46,675 --> 00:16:49,542
You have news?
There's been a development.

301
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:52,111
You found Stephen?
You caught Jennifer's killer?

302
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,774
There's a Iead.
That's all for now.

303
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:59,753
I thought the investigation
was on hold.
I thought you'd given up.

304
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:04,826
Come in, Captain.
Let us show you something.

305
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:13,560
We celebrate
Stephen's birthdays, buy him
presents every Christmas.

306
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,800
MARGARET: This is his room.

307
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,832
So you see, Captain.
We never Iost hope.

308
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,048
If your client
is willing to cooperate...
Where's Stephen Talmadge?

309
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:28,742
Who?

310
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,875
What, you forgot
to tell your new
hotshot Iawyer

311
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,817
you kidnapped a baby
after killing the mother?

312
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:35,083
What, are you crazy?
It's all right here
in your book.

313
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:37,216
We're willing to deal
in exchange for information.

314
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:39,453
No. You can't prove
that I kidnapped
or killed anybody.

315
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:41,120
Not now and not then. No.

316
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:44,131
Actually, we have specific...
The offer's good
for 10 more seconds.

317
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:47,465
You don't have a case.
CRAGEN: Oh, really?

318
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:52,763
After I tie you
to the Talmadge kidnapping
and murder,

319
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:54,866
I'm gonna nail your ass
to the wall.

320
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,076
(DOOR BUZZING)

321
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:03,979
What the hell was that?

322
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:06,782
Well, you weren't
getting him to talk,
so I had to give it a shot.

323
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:08,550
What?
With the macho cop routine?

324
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:10,420
I could have used
the kidnapping charge
as Ieverage

325
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:11,720
if you'd just given me
the chance.

326
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,920
I gave you your chance.
You Iost your cool.

327
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:15,986
You are too
emotionally invested
in this case.

328
00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:17,395
Damn right.

329
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,330
I read all of Greevey's files.

330
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:22,631
He interviewed
a Iot of people who said

331
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:25,434
what a wonderful person
Jennifer Talmadge was.

332
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:27,767
Too bad none of them
can give us any Ieads
on her murder.

333
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:29,504
What about forensics?

334
00:18:29,578 --> 00:18:32,376
Only one set of prints
at the murder scene
unaccounted for.

335
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:34,915
I ran them again,
no match in the system.

336
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,017
Try this.
What is it?

337
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:39,986
Max's notes. His widow, Marie,
gave them to me Iast night.

338
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,682
You are on a mission.

339
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,859
I've been on this
for 1 2 years.
I want some closure.

340
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:49,858
Where are we
on Sanford's other babies?

341
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:53,526
We talked to the couple
adopting the boy.
They're getting him tomorrow.

342
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:56,298
The baby girl
goes with her new parents
the day after that.

343
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:58,066
Both adoptions are Iegal?

344
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,673
According to ACS,
Sanford followed
all the rules.

345
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:02,835
Social worker sent
to do home studies,

346
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:06,779
the parents had to take
medical exams to rule out
Iife-threatening illnesses.

347
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,578
The birth mothers
and fathers all consented.

348
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:13,314
The papers were signed,
notarized, witnessed,
registered in court.

349
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:15,080
As far as we can tell,
there's no indication

350
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,648
he's put any other
snatched babies
up for adoption

351
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:19,626
besides Talmadge and Daricek.

352
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:22,390
So what's his scam?
Sanford's triple-dipping.

353
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:25,490
He promises one baby
to three different families,

354
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,365
then he tells two of
the families that the mother
changed her mind,

355
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:30,233
keeps the money.
How much?

356
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:34,204
$30,000 a couple.
And none of these victims
call the cops?

357
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:35,334
FIN: They're desperate.

358
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,173
They're afraid if they snitch
and word gets out,

359
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:39,236
no other baby brokers
will deal with them.

360
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:42,943
You get anywhere
on Sanford's files?
Found his phone bills
for 1989.

361
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:46,078
Phone company's
getting us the names
of all his outgoing calls.

362
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:49,055
These files are at Ieast
a three-person job.

363
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:51,118
This is interesting.
What's that?

364
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:53,787
Greevey has a note
in here about Jennifer's
college roommate, Rebecca.

365
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,489
Says he was supposed to
talk to her in England.

366
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:57,759
There's nothing
in the case file
that says they ever spoke.

367
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:01,791
Well, that means Max
never talked to her.
Let's track her down.

368
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:07,338
MUNCH:
Were you and Jennifer close?

369
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:12,239
In a college roommate
sort of way. We shared
a suite at the dorm.

370
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,213
Then you must have known
if she had any boyfriends.

371
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:19,151
Just one. Broke her heart.
Who was he?

372
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:21,315
A guy named Rob.

373
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:24,049
Met him at a party and,
you know,
they dated a couple of times

374
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,390
before she brought him
back to the suite
to stay over.

375
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:30,224
The first time I saw him,
I knew he was trouble.

376
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:31,595
Why?

377
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,033
Well, I warned Jen that I had
seen him walking on the campus
with another girl,

378
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:38,197
but, you know...
Jen, she was a Iittle naive.

379
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,001
She was in Iove with him,
you know,
I think he was her first.

380
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:45,376
MUNCH: How Iong
did they go out?
About two weeks

381
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:48,311
before he broke up with her.
He give a reason?

382
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:50,946
Guys never do.

383
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:55,055
Did you know
Jennifer was pregnant?

384
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:58,650
Not at first, but, you know,
she couldn't hide it for Iong.

385
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:00,922
She knew Rob
had to be the father.

386
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:04,327
What's Rob's Iast name?
Cook.

387
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,495
Robert Cook.

388
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:11,068
Any idea if she told him?
Yeah. She sent him a Ietter.

389
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,367
Thank you.

390
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:17,671
CRAGEN: Robert Cook?

391
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:20,606
Can I help you?

392
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:22,210
NYPD,

393
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:24,809
Captain Donald Cragen,
Detective John Munch.

394
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:26,786
Just be a second, boys.

395
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:29,247
It's the future of baseball.

396
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:33,727
Well, you know, for now
we're just trying to win
one Little League game.

397
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:37,629
But you didn't come here
to watch us play.
We're here about your son.

398
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,999
He's what? About 12?

399
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:42,661
The older one, Brandon, is,
but I don't understand.

400
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,728
Do you have
his birth certificate?
His mother's got it.

401
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:46,239
Where is she?
She's up in Mahopac,

402
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:48,105
we're recently divorced.
What the hell's going on here?

403
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,041
We're gonna have to ask you
and your son to come with us.

404
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:52,511
Excuse me?
I don't even know
what this is about.

405
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,979
Jennifer Talmadge.

406
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:58,582
From college?
She was murdered 12 years ago.

407
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,981
Yeah, I know that,
but what's that
got to do with me?

408
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,786
Her son disappeared.
We think you're the father.

409
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:10,328
I read about Jennifer
in the paper,
but I swear in a million years

410
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:12,423
I never thought
that child was mine.

411
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,664
We only slept together
a few times.
Sixth grade sex ed.
Once is enough.

412
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:19,036
So, you had a fling
with Jennifer,
and then you dumped her.

413
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:20,506
It was college.

414
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:24,238
My girlfriend Linda and I
were on the outs,
so I was dating Jennifer.

415
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:26,974
But you didn't count on
knocking her up.

416
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:31,618
Jennifer showing up with a kid
would've put a crimp in your
big plans for the future.

417
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:35,782
I broke up with her, I didn't
kill her. I didn't even know
she was pregnant.

418
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,620
Her roommate said
that Jennifer sent you
a Ietter.

419
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:39,853
I never got any Ietter.

420
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:43,091
Mr. Cook, can you prove
Brandon is your son
with your ex-wife?

421
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:44,654
Of course I can.

422
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,236
You think I killed Jennifer
and then somehow
adopted my own child?

423
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:59,273
I broke up with Jennifer
because Linda told me
she was pregnant.

424
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:01,508
We got married
as soon as the semester
was over.

425
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,016
Brandon is our son.

426
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,756
We're going to need DNA
from all three of you.

427
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,161
You have Brandon's
birth certificate.
Is this really necessary?

428
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:25,035
I'm only complying
with the court order,
Mrs. Cook.

429
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:26,696
Linda...
Don't.

430
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,743
If you kept it
in your pants...
We were kids...

431
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,710
And now we're
murder suspects.
This is not the time.

432
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:34,146
I resent being dragged
in here, having to prove
my son is my son.

433
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:35,807
Mrs. Cook, you're next.

434
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:38,546
LINDA: No. I want my attorney.

435
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:41,285
Your attorney
is going to tell you
if you don't comply,

436
00:23:41,356 --> 00:23:44,348
we're gonna be ordered
to arrest you
for contempt of court.

437
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,587
I have plenty of contempt
for this. Make it quick.

438
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:59,506
Done?
Thank you
for your patience.

439
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:01,667
Let's get out of here.

440
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:05,673
Mitochondrial DNA
on Cook's 12-year-old

441
00:24:05,747 --> 00:24:07,681
doesn't match
Jennifer Talmadge's mother.

442
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:09,273
Meaning he's not
Jennifer's son.

443
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,614
He is, however,
the son of Linda
and Robert Cook.

444
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:13,517
99.9 % probability.

445
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:16,182
Captain, you better
take a Iook at these.

446
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,482
Where'd you get this?

447
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,050
From what we found stored
in Mark Sanford's basement.

448
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:22,756
Why?
Stephen Talmadge's
adoption papers.

449
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:24,628
Signed by his mother.

450
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,432
It's not possible.

451
00:24:27,502 --> 00:24:29,800
We have copies
of the adoption papers.

452
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,668
But Jennifer changed her mind.

453
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:33,969
At first she was ashamed.

454
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:38,375
You know, she thought we were,
too, but we said we would
support her financially.

455
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:42,212
We'd watch Stephen
during the day
so she could finish college.

456
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:44,308
May we see those papers,
please?

457
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:52,152
This isn't
Jennifer's signature.

458
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,525
Are you sure?
Yes.

459
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:58,132
Do we still have
Jennifer's passport.
Let me see.

460
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:02,202
Did Jennifer tell you
who the father was?

461
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:07,036
No. She said
she tried to contact him,
but he never responded.

462
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,702
Here. See for yourself.

463
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,077
It's not even close.

464
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:20,015
You think this has
anything to do
with Jennifer's murder?

465
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:23,622
That's what we're
gonna find out.
Thank you.

466
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:29,353
CRAGEN: Adoption papers.
Passport.

467
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:32,556
Signatures don't match.

468
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,795
You're screwed.

469
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:39,999
I didn't forge any papers,
I didn't steal any babies,

470
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,541
I didn't kill anyone.

471
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:44,043
You defraud couples
desperate for children.

472
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:48,481
When we present your scam
in court, a jury will convict
you of murder and kidnapping.

473
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:54,650
What's your offer?

474
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:58,488
No jail time,
he makes restitution to
all the couples he defrauded.

475
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:00,958
And you give me
Stephen Talmadge.

476
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:08,363
A woman came to me
with a baby,
purporting to be the mother.

477
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:11,836
She had the boy's original
birth certificate. I didn't
know she was an imposter

478
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:14,875
and then I saw
Jennifer Talmadge's picture
in the papers, and...

479
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:17,503
And you couldn't risk
going to the cops.

480
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:24,940
You give me the name
of the family
that adopted Stephen. Now.

481
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:31,352
DANIEL: Line drive into center
field. Looks Iike it's over
the second baseman's head.

482
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:34,452
But BIake makes
a brilliant catch,
ending up the game.

483
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:37,956
Hello?
Thanks, we don't want any.

484
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,691
It's the cops.

485
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:45,202
Mom, the police are here.

486
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:49,107
Oh, for heaven's sake, Tyler,
where are your manners?

487
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:52,806
Come in, Officers.
Danny, Brian, Tyler, outside.

488
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:58,345
Hey, you guys Iooking
for Tyler? The way he played
second base was a crime.

489
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:03,183
ERIN: How can I help you?

490
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:07,591
Mrs. BIake,
Captain Don Cragen,
Detective John Munch.

491
00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:11,391
Is Tyler your son?
Yes, of course.
What's going on?

492
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:13,832
Did you adopt him
through Mark Sanford?

493
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:16,664
Yes. How did you know
he was adopted?

494
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:19,832
Was Tyler born
on June 2nd, 1989?

495
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:23,672
Why are you asking
all these questions?

496
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:31,318
Kidnapped?

497
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:35,012
Are you sure?

498
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:37,586
Sanford admitted
what happened.

499
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:40,890
A DNA test will confirm
he's Stephen Talmadge.

500
00:27:41,863 --> 00:27:46,197
What am I gonna tell
my husband and Tyler?

501
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:55,366
Do you have to take him?
You can come with him.

502
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:59,312
We didn't do
anything wrong.
We know.

503
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:01,906
He's been missing
for 12 years.

504
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,356
Tyler.

505
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:19,792
I'm not going.
I don't wanna Ieave!

506
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:24,561
Go upstairs and get changed.
I'II call your dad at work.

507
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,265
We'II go together.
Hey, you're not in trouble.

508
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:55,992
Is it definite?
The DNA is conclusive,
Mr. Cook.

509
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:59,531
Tyler is your biological son.

510
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:03,506
How can I ever explain to him
what happened?

511
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:05,873
Why I wasn't there for him?

512
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:09,178
When the time is right,
you'II tell him the truth.

513
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:12,244
He's almost a teenager.

514
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,550
There's still plenty of time
for you to get to know him.

515
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:20,594
The family who raised him,
they did a good job,
didn't they?

516
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:24,188
Oh, he's had a good Iife,
wonderful mother and father.

517
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,360
I'm his father.

518
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,335
I never would have
abandoned him.

519
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,273
He belongs with me.

520
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:51,115
We fed him, we clothed him.
He's Iike our own flesh
and blood.

521
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,827
Mark Sanford told us
it was all Iegal.

522
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:57,092
Tyler's biological father
never consented
to the adoption.

523
00:29:57,165 --> 00:30:00,396
That nullifies it.
For God's sake,
he's our son!

524
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:03,561
You can't just take him away
after all these years.

525
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:08,598
I know how hard
this must be for you...
We are the only parents
he has ever known.

526
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,278
We were a happy family
until you came along.

527
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:13,472
How could you do this to us?

528
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,747
We can't play Solomon
and split the child.

529
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:20,083
I can't get him into
a foster home
until tomorrow morning.

530
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:21,678
I hate to do it,
but I think Tyler's
gonna have to

531
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:23,189
spend the night
at the Laight Street Shelter.

532
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:24,451
Why put him in that hellhole

533
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:26,618
when his grandparents
have right of
natural guardianship?

534
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:27,718
I don't Iike it
any more than you do,

535
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:29,763
but the Iaw doesn't
give grandparents
automatic custody...

536
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,230
Just forget the Iaw
and just for one minute

537
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,164
think about
what's in the best interests
of this child!

538
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:34,724
Don't you think I am?

539
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:36,560
Right now everybody
wants a piece of Tyler.

540
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:39,037
Maybe the best place for him
is somewhere neutral.

541
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,370
Why don't you tell that
to his grandparents?

542
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:44,002
Right this way. Thank you.

543
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:50,678
You know how Iong we've waited
for this moment, Captain.

544
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:52,582
Our daughter was taken away,

545
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:55,747
and now you're telling us
that we can't have
our grandson?

546
00:30:55,823 --> 00:30:59,691
I can't release Tyler to you
unless a judge says I can,

547
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,024
but you can apply
for temporary custody.

548
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:05,463
We have to go to court?
What about permanent custody?

549
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:11,803
Tyler's biological father
is probably going to claim
his parental rights,

550
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:15,502
and as Iong as
he's deemed fit,
his rights supersede yours.

551
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:18,134
His mother was our only child.

552
00:31:19,513 --> 00:31:22,141
You gave us our hope back.

553
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,352
Now how can you just
take it away from us
Iike this?

554
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,117
So what happens to me?

555
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:35,453
Well, you'II have to go
to a temporary home
until a judge decides.

556
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:38,157
I wanna just go home
with my parents.

557
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,096
I know you do,
but your adoption was illegal.

558
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,603
So what?
They never hurt me
or did anything wrong.

559
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,565
They Iove me.

560
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:49,408
I know they do.

561
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,669
Tyler...

562
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,883
I'm sorry,

563
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:59,276
but what I did today
is my job.

564
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:02,388
I didn't want to take you,
but I had to
because the Iaw says so.

565
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:04,890
But the Iaw also says
that I have to protect you

566
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,517
from anything bad

567
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:09,722
and that's a part of my job
I Iike. Okay?

568
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,262
AII right.

569
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:23,571
Hey. Your mother's parents,

570
00:32:23,644 --> 00:32:26,238
your grandparents,
they wanna meet you.

571
00:32:31,352 --> 00:32:32,979
Are you ready?

572
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:37,955
I guess. Do I have to
hug them or anything?
Hey.

573
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,387
You just do
whatever you feel, all right?

574
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:48,863
Stephen.

575
00:32:51,672 --> 00:32:53,367
My name is Tyler.

576
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:57,175
Nice to meet you,

577
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:58,803
Tyler.

578
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:05,014
PIease... PIease don't cry.

579
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,280
AII right.

580
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:17,924
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

581
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,368
Got a minute?

582
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:25,962
Only if you promise
not to tell me
you told me so.

583
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,099
You were just doing your job.

584
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,666
Following the Iead
of a 12-year-old crime.

585
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:35,438
And now Tyler BIake's
the victim and I don't know
how to fix it.

586
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:37,210
Then Iet me help.

587
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,856
You have any suggestions,
I'm all ears.

588
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,786
Tyler's going to need
a Iaw guardian
for the adoption hearing.

589
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,024
There's a three-week backlog
on court-appointed attorneys,
so I'II volunteer.

590
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,767
Well, that's a hell of a
gesture, AIex, but the Iaw
favors the biological parent.

591
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,667
The Iaw also says
that Tyler is old enough
and mature enough

592
00:33:57,738 --> 00:33:59,706
to know who he
wants to Iive with.

593
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:02,538
If I'm his attorney,
I have to fight
for what he wants,

594
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,135
and he wants to Iive
with the BIakes.

595
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,753
Tyler is an articulate,
intelligent 12-year-old.

596
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:18,018
CABOT: You've talked to him,
you've read the reports.

597
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:21,425
What's your conclusion
about how Tyler functions
in his world?

598
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:22,723
That he's well-adjusted.

599
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:25,891
He gets excellent grades
and he has Iots of friends.

600
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:29,402
And what did this indicate
to you about his home Iife?

601
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,804
That Tyler is the child
of Ioving parents,
the product of a happy home.

602
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,808
CABOT: If Tyler was
forced to Iive
with his biological father,

603
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:39,209
how do you think
this would affect his Iife?

604
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,544
That would be akin to
waking up in the morning

605
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,879
and Iearning that his parents
had been killed
in a car crash.

606
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,612
A sudden traumatic Ioss.

607
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,983
CABOT: And what could be
the consequences?

608
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:51,319
Children that experience
a sudden Ioss
of a parent or caretaker

609
00:34:51,392 --> 00:34:53,952
often suffer from
behavioral problems.

610
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:56,188
Not to mention the depression
that a child his age

611
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,891
often goes through
after something so traumatic.

612
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,729
In your opinion then, Doctor,
would you recommend

613
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:03,269
that Tyler be placed
with his biological father?

614
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:04,497
No.

615
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:06,870
That would be asking him
to make too huge a transition

616
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:09,501
at a time in his Iife
when he's the most vulnerable.

617
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:10,976
Thank you, Doctor.

618
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,611
Mr. Stern?
I have no questions.

619
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:21,947
This is Tyler's
first birthday.

620
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:24,718
We squeezed 100 people
into the house.

621
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:26,417
You've got
a Iot of pictures there.

622
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:29,930
Tyler's been the center
of our Iives
since the day we got him.

623
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:32,631
What kind of Iife
has he had with you?

624
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,569
We don't have a Iot of money,
but he doesn't want
for anything.

625
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,968
Especially our Iove.

626
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,705
We've tried to be
the best parents we can.

627
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:48,109
Mrs. BIake, did you know
12 years ago that
the adoption was not Iegal?

628
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:50,779
Did you know
about the death
of Tyler's mother?

629
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,148
Of course not.

630
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:55,245
We did everything
Mr. Sanford told us to do.

631
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:57,983
And now that you do know?

632
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,090
We're terrified that we're
going to Iose Tyler.

633
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,630
We can't imagine
being without him.

634
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:10,898
PIease,
don't punish our family

635
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:12,529
for someone else's crime.

636
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,671
Thank you.

637
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:25,409
I'm sorry for the tragedy
you and your husband
are going through right now.

638
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,918
And Tyler. He's been
our son all his Iife.

639
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:31,514
And you've done
a wonderful job raising him.

640
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,221
Thank you.

641
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:35,421
And can you imagine
how Mr. Cook feels then,

642
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:38,795
all these years he Iost
not knowing Tyler was his son?

643
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,802
Mr. Cook has other children.
Tyler is all we have.

644
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:45,933
Mrs. BIake,
if your child was Iost,

645
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:48,566
and a nice family took him in
and raised him well,

646
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:51,975
and then you found him,
wouldn't you want him back?

647
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:58,344
Yes.

648
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:04,023
I wasn't there to give Tyler
the Iove and attention
the BIakes did,

649
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:06,651
because I was robbed
of the chance.

650
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,824
You're recently divorced,
you already have two sons.

651
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:13,094
How can you convince
this court that you can
take care of a third child?

652
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:15,635
Just Iook at what I've done
with my sons.

653
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,735
Tyler would have
a brother his age,

654
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:22,071
a devoted father
who could more than
provide for him.

655
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:26,276
And he has his mother's
parents. I want them
to be a part of his Iife.

656
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:34,486
Mr. Cook, Tyler has grown up
with a mother and father
who Iove him.

657
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:37,456
Do you think his Iife
would improve
Iiving with you?

658
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,625
I know I am now
a single parent.
I wish it were different,

659
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,725
but Tyler
is my flesh and blood.

660
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,067
You've spent time with Tyler.

661
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:52,603
What do you think of the job
the BIakes have done
as parents?

662
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:57,569
Just as good as I
could've ever done.

663
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:00,043
Can you imagine, then,
what they must be
going through?

664
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:04,244
You can't imagine
how hard it is for me
to make them go through it.

665
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:08,415
You just finished
a bitter custody battle
with your ex-wife.

666
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:11,947
She was seeking full custody
of your two sons,
is that correct?

667
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:15,823
Yes.

668
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,223
Mr. Cook,
how would you have felt
if she'd won,

669
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:21,700
and you weren't able
to see your children
anytime you wanted?

670
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,200
It would've crushed me.

671
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:32,339
I'm sorry.

672
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,778
How's it going?
Ripping my guts out.

673
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:40,887
These are all good people.

674
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:42,454
We finished talking
to the birthmothers

675
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:44,718
who gave their babies
to Sanford for adoption.

676
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:48,284
AII Iegit.
If Sanford stole babies,
we can't find them.

677
00:38:48,462 --> 00:38:50,794
Your faces tell me
there's more to this story.

678
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:55,596
His ex-wife, Linda Cook,
gave birth to her oldest son
at Long Island Jewish

679
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:58,263
a month before
Jennifer Talmadge
gave birth.

680
00:38:58,372 --> 00:39:01,466
Linda's hospital roommate
was a client of Sanford's.

681
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:04,005
Says she recommended
Sanford to Linda.

682
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:06,569
STABLER: We compared
Jennifer's signature
on the adoption papers

683
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:10,014
to Linda Cook's signature
on the release forms
for her DNA.

684
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:13,310
Let's get Linda Cook in here.

685
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:15,978
LINDA: Robert and I
are divorced.

686
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:19,321
Whether he gets
to keep his Iove child
has nothing to do with me.

687
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:20,883
Why am I here?

688
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:24,054
CRAGEN: 12 years ago,
Jennifer Talmadge wrote
a Ietter to your husband

689
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:26,258
telling him
she was having his baby.

690
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:28,796
So?

691
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:33,500
Well, he never got it,
because you intercepted it.

692
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,909
That's how you found out
about Jennifer.

693
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:40,103
Is this some fantasy
you concocted?

694
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,205
When you gave birth
to your son,

695
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:46,412
why did you ask
your hospital roommate
about her adoption attorney?

696
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,547
I knew Rob was fooling around
on me. I didn't know he'd
ask me to marry him.

697
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:54,151
And when he did,
you realized it would
be better for everybody

698
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:56,890
if your husband didn't know
he had a Iove child.

699
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:59,194
Where are you
getting this from?

700
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:03,828
Jennifer's signature
on the adoption papers.

701
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:09,075
That's your handwriting.

702
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:13,478
You get the Ietter,
you go to see Jennifer.

703
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:16,616
Something happens.
She's dead.

704
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:19,950
And now you're gonna find
some place for the baby,

705
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:21,520
so you impersonate her

706
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,853
and you give Stephen
to Mark Sanford for adoption.

707
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:30,427
Now just tell me that you
didn't plan to kill her
and I can help you.

708
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:38,996
I want a Iawyer.

709
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:45,073
SERANI: Most of the children
who come through this court

710
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:47,477
have nobody who wants
or Ioves them.

711
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:50,679
This case is
so much more difficult,

712
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:54,517
because all the parties
have only acted
in the child's best interest.

713
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:59,383
Mr. Cook, it's clear
that you never intended
to abandon Tyler

714
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,691
and that you're
more than suitable
to make a home for him.

715
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:08,133
Mr. and Mrs. BIake,
you're Ioving,
excellent model parents,

716
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,059
an example to follow.

717
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:16,943
But the Iaw recognizes
the right of the
biological parent as paramount

718
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,604
as Iong as that parent
is deemed fit.

719
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:25,377
Therefore, I have no choice
but to award custody
of the child to Mr. Cook.

720
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:31,519
Mr. Cook, I urge you
in the strongest
possible terms

721
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:34,652
to continue to act
in Tyler's best interest

722
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:36,889
with regards to his
adoptive parents.

723
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:39,826
(GAVEL POUNDING)
We're adjourned.

724
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:51,042
Tyler.

725
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:55,705
We'II see you when you
come over to get your stuff,
okay, buddy?

726
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,060
Prosecuting's easier.
At Ieast then you know
who the bad guy is.

727
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:21,038
You okay?
They're talking. It's a start.
