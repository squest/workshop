to have them.

Luckily it's built
out of stone.

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,036
Purse and panties
are gone.

Excuse me, Father.

My Latin never got much past

amo, amas, amat,
Maybe you can help me
with this.

36
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,343
Does that mean
"I have sinned?"

00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:28,875
Did you know this boy,
Father?

38
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,883
I had never saw him before.

39
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,346
Father, we're gonna need you
to come down to the precinct

40
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:37,153
and make a statement for us.
Of course.

So the perp
meets the victim.

Maybe he knows
he's a transvestite,
maybe not.

43
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,360
Well, if he didn't,
that'd definitely be enough
to set him off.

00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:51,930
They come in here to trick,
perp sodomizes him
and kills him,

decorates his body,
then gives him a funeral pyre.

46
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:58,438
Why go to all the trouble
and then try to cover it up?

47
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:01,677
He's in a church,
he feels guilty.

48
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:06,454
He tells God he's sorry
and then he tries
to burn away the sin.

49
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,198
Bruising to the thighs, small
anal tears, but the attack
wasn't particularly violent.

50
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:03,537
Cause of death,
massive hemorrhage
from a skull fracture.

51
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:05,976
Any ideas
about the murder weapon?

52

WARNER: BIunt trauma
to the temple

53
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:11,782
caused by something round
and heavy Iike an iron bar
or flashlight.

54
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:14,854
But the fracture pattern
on the occiput is diffused.

55
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:17,085
He cracked his head
on the floor
when he fell back?

56
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,753
WARNER: Probably.
You got anything on our perp?

57
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,788
He didn't practice safe rape.
We got fluids.
We're running his DNA.

58
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,725
Any chance of getting prints
off the body?

59
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:30,829
He was wearing
surgical gloves. We found
traces of Iatex and powder.

60
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:32,874
No condom,
but he was wearing gloves?

61
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:35,103
You think that's weird,

62
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:38,943
I found traces of
sodium dichlorotriazinetrione
inside him.

63
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:42,379
It's the main cleaning agent
in scouring powder.

64
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:46,114
And this,
small fragments of steel wool.

65
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:49,055
Our perp used both
to scrub his penis.

66
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,356
So he's really clean.
And really dirty.

67
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,122
I found the body
when I came down to prepare
for 6:00 mass.

68
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,496
That's early.

69
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:02,003
There's nothing Iike
a hit of God before you
do battle on Wall Street.

70
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:05,234
Still, it seems Iike
a pretty rough area to Ieave
the side door unlocked.

71
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:08,038
Well, the church is supposed
to be a refuge.

72
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,601
This morning I asked
if you knew the victim.

73
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,113
You didn't seem surprised
he was a boy.

74
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:16,117
Well, when you serve
in this part of town,
you see almost everything.

75
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:18,585
So you never saw him before?
No.

76
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:22,587
But there is someone
in the trenches
who might have.

77
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,796
FIN: We're thinking
maybe he crossed your path.

78
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:30,696
PEG: Oh, dear Lord. Jamie.

79
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,757
He's dead?
You know him?

80
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:37,628
James Doyle, 16 years old,
called himself Jamie.

81
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,906
Ran away from home when
his folks tried to Iock him up
in a treatment center.

82
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:45,538
How Iong has he been
coming down here?
Four, five months.

83
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:48,845
Trying to earn enough
for a sex change.
Trannies make good money.

84
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:51,182
Any reason why you think
he'd end up at Saint Martha's?

85
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:52,743
That's where he died?

86
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:55,814
He went in there
to do business. Priest Ieft
the side door open.

87
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:59,418
Father Michael always Ieaves
the church open for the pros
when it's cold and wet.

88
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:01,122
But they know
not to do business there.

89
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:05,600
What's this
Father Michael Iike?
He's a good priest
and a good man.

90
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:10,431
Anything else you can tell me
about who did this
so I can warn folk?

91
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:14,272
Yeah. He's very particular
about his personal hygiene.

92
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:16,607
(SNICKERING)
He should stand out a mile.

93
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:21,440
VICAP can't find
any direct matches
for the M.O. or signature.

94
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:23,849
Just a partial out in EI Paso,

95
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,353
man murdered his wife,
Ieft her body in the church.

96
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,583
Don't tell me,
where they were married.
Yep.

97
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:31,854
And now he's sitting
on death row
so he's not much good to us.

98
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:33,019
You know, maybe
this is the first time

99
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:36,394
the place didn't burn
and the body's been preserved.

100
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,024
No one's actually ever seen
these Iittle rituals.

101
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:42,502
I'II ask VICAP
to widen the search
to all arson-related deaths

102
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,096
and cross-check with crimes
against transsexuals
and transvestites.

103
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:47,802
Warner got a DNA match.
One Mr. Gus Yoder.

104
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:51,779
Just paroled from Attica.
Did four years for guess what?
Arson.

105
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:03,691
What is this?
Gus Yoder?

106
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,056
What do you want?

107
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,220
The skinny
on your relationship
with Jamie Doyle.

108
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,524
I don't know no Jamie Doyle.

109
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:12,431
You always wear those gloves?
Customers don't Iike prints
on the glass.

110
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,695
Tell us about it
at the precinct.

111
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:18,331
PIease. Don't touch me.
I'II go where you want,
but don't touch me.

112
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:22,571
Looks Iike we got us a racist.
I'm a Jew.
Is that better or worse?

113
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:27,011
Haven't you heard of safe sex,
Mr. Yoder?
Of course I have.

114
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,846
Then why'd you Ieave millions
of Iittle Yoders
inside of Jamie Doyle?

115
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,184
We got a DNA match, Gus.
We know you were with him.

116
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,356
I didn't touch him.
Sodomy doesn't count
as touching?

117
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:37,790
I didn't do that.

118
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,885
Come on. You thought
Jamie was a cute Iittle trick

119
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:41,395
till he showed you
his surprise package.

120
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:43,523
And that pissed you off
and you cracked his skull.

121
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,829
Or maybe you Iike Iittle boys,
as Iong as they
Iook Iike girls.

122
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:48,028
GUS: No.
Sit down, Gus,
you're making me nervous.

123
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,627
I'm not sitting there,
it's disgusting.

124
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,696
It's a chair.
It's filthy.

125
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:54,572
Think of all the scum
that have sat there.
Yeah, you for one.

126
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:58,909
I can't breathe in here.
I wanna go home.
Not till we're finished.

127
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:01,141
We're searching your place,
Gus.

128
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:04,152
Is that where we're gonna
find Jamie Doyle's purse,
maybe his panties?

129
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,087
AII right. So I picked him up.
I had sex with him.

130
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:09,784
But he was alive
when he got out of my car.

131
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:18,699
He tightens his sphincter
any more,
he's gonna implode.

132
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:22,635
OCD. He probably
washes his hands
about 50 times a day.

133
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:25,333
Let me have a Iook
at the crime scene.

134
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,234
HUANG: What's this?

135
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:29,174
BENSON: It's a rosary.
His?

136
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:31,873
Priest said it came from
one of the statues
in the church.

137
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:34,415
And it's right
around his neck,
not just placed there?

138
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:37,418
It's right around. Why?
It's not Yoder.

139
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:40,649
There's no way
that he'd go near a dead body
or touch blood.

140
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:43,123
The guy has unprotected sex
with a male prostitute.

141
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,285
You can't tell me
he's squeamish.
He is.

142
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:48,353
After he has sex,
he wants to get as far away
from his partner as possible.

143
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,921
Or he feels dirty
and he kills him.

144
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:55,662
What's this?
That's Latin for
"I have sinned"'

145
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:59,604
I checked it with the priest.
Well, he's wrong.

146
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:03,873
"I have sinned" is Peccavi,
Peccavisti is
"You have sinned"'

147
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:07,211
This isn't a confession,
it's an accusation.
Against the victim?

148
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,148
Burning the confessional,
carving "You have sinned,"

149
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:11,846
seem more Iike acts of rage
against the Church
and the priest.

150
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:15,516
So Jamie's death is what,
an accident?
It could be.

151
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:18,583
The altar cloth, the candles,
the rosary beads,

152
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,787
you can't say
they're accidental.

153
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:24,322
But they were all done
post mortem.
The kill itself is accidental.

154
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,799
Yes, our man killed Jamie,

155
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,894
but the ritualistic elements
seem Iike acts of contrition.

156
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:33,567
So he was attacking
the priest, and Jamie just
happened to get in the way.

157
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:36,907
And if the killer had a grudge
against the priest,

158
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,743
there's a good chance
that Father Michael knows him.

159
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:43,979
Check the Father's background,
see if he's been keeping
bad company.

160
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:45,714
Yes, I'm still on hold.

161
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,779
Okay. Thank you for that.

162
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:52,158
That was the secretary from
Saint Thomas's Catholic School
in Hoboken.

163
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,388
Father Michael
used to teach there.

164
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:57,864
October 1996 he Ieft abruptly,
right in the middle of a term.

165
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:58,991
What was the reason given?

166
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:01,730
She says she doesn't know
for sure, but according
to the rumor mill,

167
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:03,829
a priest abused some boys,
he was then removed.

168
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:04,998
And the case
never came to trial.

169
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:07,508
Far as she's heard
it was never even reported.

170
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:10,044
I'II get Munch and Fin
to check
with the Hoboken cops.

171
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,374
You two talk to Father Michael

172
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:14,575
before the Church
gets wind of this
and removes him again.

173
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,242
EIIiot.
Not a problem, Captain.

174
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:19,549
Well, if it becomes one,
you can take a back seat.

175
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:25,452
You know, I try to be
a good Catholic, raise my kids
as good Catholics.

176
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,757
Something Iike this
shakes your faith. I know.

177
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,425
If I didn't see
through this guy,
how could a 14-year-old?

178
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,394
How could an eight-year-old?

179
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,108
Hello, Detectives.

180
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,878
We need to ask you
some more questions, Father.

181
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:51,843
AII right.

182
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
I'd Iike to know
why you Iied to me.

183
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:58,457
About what?
The message
on the confessional.

184
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,462
The correct translation is
"You have sinned"'

185
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:07,834
Well, I'm very sorry.
I was never very good
at Latin.

186
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:11,903
Or maybe you're the sinner.
Well, who isn't, Detective?

187
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:13,965
BENSON:
Where were you Iast night?

188
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,837
I was with a parishioner.

189
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,848
I was helping him
through a midnight crisis.

190
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,440
Give us a name.

191
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,578
I can't.
BENSON: Why?

192
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:30,148
Because he confessed
to the murder?
You know better than
to ask me that.

193
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,525
STABLER:
Saint Thomas's School,
October '96.

194
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:38,157
There are rumors that a priest
sexually abused some boys.

195
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,134
Was it you?

196
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:49,069
Tell us what happened
or we'II just get it
from the Hoboken police.

197
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,604
I signed
a confidentiality agreement.

198
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,045
What planet
you been Iiving on, Father?

199
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:55,879
Confidentiality agreements
won't hold up
in a criminal court.

200
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,350
Evening mass starts
in 20 minutes.

201
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,444
If you're going to charge me
with something, charge me.

202
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:01,489
Otherwise, please Ieave.

203
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,859
Saint Thomas's School?

204
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:12,025
That's one I'd rather forget.
Why?

205
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:15,070
(TV CHATTERING)
The case never went anywhere.
Nobody wanted it to.

206
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:16,365
Sit. Sit.

207
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:19,737
So, how'd you catch it?
Somebody make a complaint?

208
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:22,106
Oh, not at the school,
the ER.

209
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:24,270
Kid falls off his bike,

210
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:28,112
doctor finds something else,
bruising around his backside.

211
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:31,950
I check out the parents.
They're clean.
Yeah, and?

212
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,512
Well, the kid's a student
at Saint Tom's.
I dig a Iittle deeper.

213
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,786
I find four boys
who say they were molested.

214
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,852
By the same priest?
Well, the stories varied.

215
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:44,194
Kids didn't want
to give names.
MUNCH: What, they were scared?

216
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:48,225
Maybe, because
just as I was getting close,
the Church steps in,

217
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:51,602
settles with the families
for 200 grand each.

218
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:54,403
Why didn't you push harder?
Try to convince the families?

219
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:55,807
You don't think I tried?

220
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:59,143
No case,
no complaining witnesses,
what could I do?

221
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:04,346
Moresco took a Iot of notes,
but never filed a report.

222
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,717
That was the alumni office
at Saint Tom's.

223
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,316
One of the boys moved
to Europe, two of them
are still in the area.

224
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:12,587
Todd Ramsay
on the Upper West Side

225
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:16,119
and Ben Campion
works three blocks
from Father Michael's church.

226
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:18,598
Well, you'd think
he'd try to be as far away
from him as possible.

227
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,396
Let's take him.

228
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:22,096
We'II take Ramsay.
What about the fourth kid?

229
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,763
Yeah. Bobby Douglas.
Don't know.

230
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,173
AIumni office said
that he severed all ties
as soon as he Ieft the school.

231
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:34,141
Monday night I was here.
I got an apartment
on the top floor.

232
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:37,652
Were you alone?
Just me and my TV.
What's this about?

233
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:41,485
We wanted to ask you
about Saint Tom's,
October '96.

234
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:47,153
We heard you made allegations
against one of the priests.

235
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,024
I've put that behind me.

236
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:51,088
But you've remained close
with Father Michael.

237
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,724
He was at Saint Tom's, right?
Yeah.

238
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:55,133
Father Mike invited me
to run this place
after college.

239
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:58,605
That was kind of him.
That's how he is.
He Iikes to help people.

240
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:01,268
He set this place up
to get the kids
off the street, you know.

241
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:04,244
Did Father Michael abuse you
at Saint Tom's?

242
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:08,009
No way. No.
He never touched me.

243
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,612
And how is he
with the kids here now?

244
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:12,551
He doesn't
come around here much anymore.

245
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,589
For the past year
I've pretty much
run the place.

246
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:17,090
But if there ever is a problem
with a kid, he's always there.

247
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,889
STABLER: For what?
Not for what you're thinking.

248
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,361
Excuse me.

249
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:26,424
I'm not going to be part
of your witch hunt.

250
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,469
Come on, guys. Let's go!

251
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:31,495
MUNCH: Mr. Ramsay?
Who are you?

252
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,766
Detectives Munch and Tutuola,
Special Victims.

253
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:37,778
How can I help you?
Do you know
Father Michael Sweeney?

254
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:38,835
I knew him at school.

255
00:14:38,914 --> 00:14:42,406
Not since then?
No, and I'm not
saying anything else.

256
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:43,917
Why not?

257
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:47,149
Confidentiality agreement.
They paid, I shut up.

258
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,324
It doesn't have to end there.
Forget it.

259
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:52,155
So a pervy priest put his hand
on my ass...

260
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,320
Todd!
...I'm not gonna Iet it
ruin my Iife.

261
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,420
It's okay, Judi.
We're going.

262
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:59,296
FIN: Where were you
Monday night?
Home with my wife.

263
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:02,633
New kid,
so we don't get out much.
What is this about?

264
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:04,729
MUNCH:
Do you know Bobby Douglas?

265
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:08,799
We stayed in touch for a while
till he started weirding out.

266
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,435
Look, I haven't seen him
for a couple of years.

267
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:12,980
You have any idea
where he Iives?

268
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,916
MUNCH: Bobby Douglas?
Yes.

269
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,378
What can I do for you,
Officers?

270
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,822
We spoke to your mom.
She said we could find you
down here.

271
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:26,622
I help out
when I can take a break
from my studies.

272
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:29,960
Do you know
Father Michael Sweeney?
Name sounds familiar.

273
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:32,967
Well, he taught
at Saint Thomas'.
Didn't you go to school there?

274
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:34,593
I've had a Iot of teachers.

275
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,571
You told the school
to take a hike after they
wrote you a big fat check.

276
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,166
Something must've happened.
I don't want to talk about it.

277
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:43,370
Did you study Latin, Father?

278
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:45,946
It's required at seminary.

279
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:49,211
What does Peccavisti mean?
I don't remember.

280
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,518
How about Monday night,
you remember that?

281
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:52,951
I was studying.

282
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,181
Where,
at Saint Martha's Church?

283
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,622
So you could Ieave
Father Michael a message?

284
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:58,683
No.
Do you remember him?

285
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,661
Oh, my God.

286
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,730
I could've been a good priest,

287
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:10,134
but he ruined me,
he took away my Iife.

288
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:12,335
Who did?

289
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:17,334
Father Michael.
I had to expose him.

290
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:20,240
MUNCH: So you tried
to burn down his church?

291
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,474
He had sinned.

292
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:33,791
Bobby was at
the homeless shelter Monday
night. What is this about?

293
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:37,263
There was a crime committed
and we just want to make
sure Bobby wasn't involved.

294
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:39,527
We have a warrant
to search your son's room,
Mrs. Douglas.

295
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:40,898
Where is it?

296
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:43,233
Down the hall on the Ieft.

297
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:45,102
Bobby wouldn't do
anything wrong.

298
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:47,869
What time did he come home
on Monday?
After midnight.

299
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,343
I was asleep, but I woke up
when I heard him on the phone.

300
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:53,040
Who was he talking to?
I don't know.

301
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:55,242
Did you hear anything else?

302
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,413
At 3:00 I woke up again.
I heard voices.

303
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,253
I came downstairs
but it was only
Father Michael.

304
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:06,158
Bobby told me
to go back to bed,
that everything was okay.

305
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:08,389
Does Father Michael
come around a Iot?

306
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:12,456
Well, yes especially
with Bobby trying
to get into the seminary.

307
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:17,736
You mean
he's not a priest already?
Oh, of course not.

308
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:21,037
You can't be a priest
unless you've been accepted
by the seminary.

309
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,736
FIN: We got something.

310
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,544
Excuse me.

311
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,915
MUNCH: He's got a thing
for virgins
and a thing for purses.

312
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:32,647
We found this in the trash.
It belongs to Jamie Doyle.

313
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:35,383
It's got 250 bucks in it
and a dozen condoms.

314
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:38,187
Looks Iike
Mr. Freaky-CIean Yoder's
in the clear.

315
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,390
This was in the closet.
Tech sprayed Iuminol on it.
Hit the Iights.

316
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,967
BENSON: BIood?
FIN: Yeah.

317
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:49,002
And what Iooks Iike skin.

318
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:56,368
BENSON: Your mom said that
Father Michael came over
in the middle of the night.

319
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:59,573
Must've been
a pretty big deal?
Not really.

320
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:02,674
Well, it sounds Iike
you wanted to get something
off your chest.

321
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:04,184
No.
No?

322
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:05,512
No.

323
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,593
You killed him
with the flashlight
that we found in your room.

324
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:17,697
But you treated him
with respect.

325
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,059
You covered him up,

326
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:24,738
Iit the candles,
those rosary beads
you gave him.

327
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,967
I mean, obviously you cared.

328
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:30,370
I said I was sorry
and I was forgiven.

329
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,943
In confession?
Yes.

330
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:38,184
You confessed
to Father Michael.

331
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,619
That's between me and God.

332
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:44,352
I did my penance.
Yeah and what's that?
Ten Hail Mary's?

333
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:50,893
You haven't asked
Jamie Doyle's family
for forgiveness, have you?

334
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:53,764
I can't face them.
Then Iet us help you.

335
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,534
Tell us what happened.

336
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:00,802
Oh, I'd already
started the fire.

337
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:06,439
I didn't know he was there.

338
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,314
He came up behind me.

339
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:12,648
He startled me,
I swung the flashlight.

340
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:17,157
He went down.
BIood started pouring.
He didn't move.

341
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:18,419
(DOOR OPENING)

342
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:22,392
This interview is over.
His mother called me.

343
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,329
We have a confession,
Counselor.

344
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,128
Well, you don't have it
in writing,

345
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:30,035
and you won't get it,
unless I get to talk terms
with the A.D.A.

346
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:34,332
Why should I deal?

347
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:37,572
I've got his confession,
and a murder weapon
with his prints all over it.

348
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:38,943
Stick a fork in him,
Kressler.

349
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:42,074
He's a victim of abuse,
working out his rage
against the Church

350
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,242
that ruined his Iife.

351
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:46,082
Jamie Doyle
was not the Church.
He was an innocent victim.

352
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:48,850
He was a transvestite hooker,
fresh from a trick

353
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:51,415
and in Iight
of the psychological damage
inflicted on Bobby.

354
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:53,393
Once I'm through
with the jury,
he won't serve a day.

355
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:56,658
He killed a 16-year-old boy
who caught him
trying to burn down a church.

356
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,358
I could try that in my sleep.

357
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:01,197
The second the jury
hears the words
priest and abuse,

358
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,931
whose side do you think
they'II be on?

359
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,407
Man two. Eight-to-10.

360
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:08,704
In this climate Bobby could
have torched a kindergarten

361
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:10,438
and a jury would
still be sympathetic.

362
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,606
Man two, five years probation
with psych treatment.

363
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:15,673
Man two, five years
Kirby Psychiatric,

364
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,911
and that depends on
what he has to tell us.

365
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:22,279
There was this room
in the basement

366
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:25,292
next to where they kept
the sports equipment.

367
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:28,561
Father Michael
called it the Lair.

368
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:34,068
He said that boys went in
as Iambs
and came out as Iions.

369
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:39,865
He'd call me in there
after practice
for extra tutoring.

370
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:44,975
He'd show me videos.
CABOT: What sort of videos?

371
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:48,742
At first just sports.
Then porn.

372
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:51,511
What sort of porn?

373
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:54,353
AII sorts.

374
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:59,018
Some with women,
some with boys.

375
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:03,428
He'd say
I shouldn't be embarrassed,

376
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,292
that how I was feeling
was normal.

377
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,731
Did he touch you?

378
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,602
He'd put his arm around me.

379
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,105
He'd stroke my Iegs.

380
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:24,381
Say I had good, strong thighs.

381
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,448
How old were you, Bobby?

382
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:30,185
Fourteen.

383
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:35,821
What else did he do to you?

384
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,792
Said I had to pass a test.

385
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,434
What test?

386
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,105
I had...

387
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:57,246
I had to masturbate.

388
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,283
He said he'd help me.

389
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,721
Then, I had to do him.

390
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:07,761
Afterwards, he said
I'd done well.

391
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:18,495
I'd made a mark in heaven.

RORY: Excuse me, Detectives.

394
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:35,185
Rory O'Halloran.
I represent the Diocese.

395
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:36,655
We have a warrant,
Mr. O'Halloran.

396
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,955
Oh, of course you do.
We'd just Iike a Iittle word.

397
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:40,324
STABLER: Who's we?

398
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:48,129
Your Grace, EIIiot Stabler.
Hi.

399
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:49,397
STABLER: OIivia Benson.

400
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:52,338
You know Bishop Mallinson?
Yes. Of course.
How can we help you?

401
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:56,776
Mr. O'Halloran says that
a search warrant has been
obtained for the rectory?

402
00:22:56,845 --> 00:23:00,246
Why is that?
We suspect Father Michael
of child abuse.

403
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:03,250
You should be more concerned
with Bobby Douglas

404
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:05,684
and his vendetta
against Father Michael.

405
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:08,655
Why would Bobby
accuse Father Michael of abuse
if it weren't true?

406
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:11,317
Because Father Michael
prevented him
from joining the priesthood.

407
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:13,861
The priesthood
is under siege.

408
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:15,987
Fragile men have crumbled.
We need strength.

409
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:19,693
Father Michael has known Bobby
for years.
He felt he was immature.

410
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:23,465
Are you aware that he was
impersonating a priest when
your colleagues found him?

411
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:26,507
Feeding the homeless
is hardly a crime,
no matter what he was wearing.

412
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:29,634
I know my priests,
Detectives.

413
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:33,670
And believe me,
if I had anything
against Father Michael,

414
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,148
it would already be
in your hands.

415
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:39,119
But he's innocent.

416
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:42,588
I'm sorry, Your Grace,
we need to
execute this warrant.

Take this back to the Iab,
scan the hard drive.

420
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:59,806
I doubt we'd find any porn
on this. It's so ancient,
it hasn't got a modem.

421
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:01,908
Nice video collection.

422
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:06,345
STABLER: Any pornography?
Mostly all sports. NBA, NHL.

423
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,839

THERAPIST: Are you attracted
to boys, Michael?
Yes,

427
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:28,230
What age?

428
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:32,199
Thirteen, 14 years old,

429
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:34,999
Tell me about your desires,

430
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:36,771
What's this?

431
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:39,746
Looks Iike some sort of
therapy session.

432
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:41,839
I want to see them naked,

433
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:48,219
In the showers,
at the youth club, I'll find
a reason to watch them,

434
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:51,457
Do you approach
these boys?
Yes,

435
00:24:52,694 --> 00:24:56,255
If one shows interest,
a look is enough,

436
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:58,595
or if he seems vulnerable,

437
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:02,995
You feel a compulsion
to touch?

438
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:10,769
I try to resist, but I'm weak,

439
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,643
I'll pat him on the back
or put my arm around him,

440
00:25:16,718 --> 00:25:19,016
but I know I want more,

441
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,514
Genital contact?

442
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:25,715
Yes,

443
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,626
Is that a confession
or a statement of intent?

444
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,891
That sounds Iike
a confession to me.

445
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:33,490
Actually, it's a part
of aversion therapy.

446
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:36,765
The subject relates
his fantasies, they're
recorded, edited into a Ioop

447
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:37,964
and played back for him

448
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,974
while he masturbates
for 30 minutes
past the point of climax.

449
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,772
That sounds painful.
It's supposed to be.

450
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:46,208
It's behavior modification.

451
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,546
The fantasies trigger
memories of pain,
instead of pleasure.

452
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:51,278
BENSON: So does it work?

453
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:53,149
Nothing can change
a sex offender's desires.

454
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:54,279
Well, then why do it?

455
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:57,518
Father Michael can't
change his desires, but
he can try to control them.

456
00:25:57,592 --> 00:26:01,028
That's what celibacy is
supposed to be all about,
controlling the desires,

457
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:03,586
channeling the sexual urge
into the Iove for God.

458
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,963
I thought celibacy was
a big part of the problem.

459
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:10,027
Most celibate priests
are not sex offenders.
Our priest is.

460
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:12,265
Well, if he gives
into temptation
then you're right.

461
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,003
An alcoholic must avoid bars,
a pedophile must stay away
from children.

462
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:17,806
Well, an alcoholic
is still an alcoholic

463
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:19,938
and Father Michael
is still a pedophile.

464
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:22,949
Actually, he's an ephebophile.

465
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:25,042
He desires adolescents,
not children.

466
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,418
Whatever you call him,
they're still children
and he's still a predator.

467
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:31,754
The question is,
can you use this tape
to prove it?

468
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:37,927
No judge is going to Iet you
introduce that tape.

469
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,523
It's doctor-patient privilege.

470
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:43,401
He hid it in his home.
That sounds Iike a turn-on,
not therapy.

471
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,439
What he uses it for
doesn't alter what it is.

472
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:48,407
The tape substantiates
Bobby Douglas's accusations.

473
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:50,467
So what? You'II never
get it in as evidence.

474
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:51,978
We could argue
it shows intent.

475
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:54,981
To deal with his problem,
not to molest boys.

476
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:58,450
You've got Bobby Douglas
in Rikers Iooking Iike
a fruit Ioop,

477
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,783
and a tape that's privileged.
Your case is pathetic.

478
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:03,153
So your answer is
to do nothing?

479
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:06,716
My answer, Captain,
is that unless
I have bulletproof evidence,

480
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:10,195
I am not jumping
on the bandwagon to crucify
the Catholic Church.

481
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:14,325
Nearly 200 priests
have been implicated
in cases of abuse so far.

482
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:18,634
Which is Iess than half
of one percent of the priests
in this country.

483
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:21,675
What we need is someone
to corroborate Bobby's story.

484
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:23,370
Another victim.

485
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:25,739
BEN: You want to
interview the boys?

486
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:27,974
Everyone between
the ages of 1 1 and 15

487
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:31,382
who's had any contact
with Father Michael Sweeney
before he Ieft the club.

488
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:33,420
You need to ask the parents.
We'II do that.

489
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:36,082
Maybe you can answer
some questions for us,
Mr. Campion.

490
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:37,181
Like what?

491
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:39,658
You ever see Father Michael
show undue interest
in any one boy?

492
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:40,751
No.

493
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:43,228
Were there any boys
who always wanted to be
near him?

494
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:45,424
Half the club.
Does that mean
they're all abused?

495
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,024
What about boys acting up?

496
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:50,366
Personality changes,
mood swings, temper tantrums?

497
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:52,565
PIenty.
They call it puberty.

498
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:57,711
Well, have any of the boys
Ieft abruptly, or been absent
for Iong periods of time?

499
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:01,247
Only one. Darius Retafian.

500
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:05,149
He stopped coming, I suppose
it was around the same time
Father Michael Ieft.

501
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,982
Okay. You know why?

502
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:09,449
I called the mother.

503
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:13,016
She told me
to Ieave them alone,
and hung up.

504
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:16,457
BENSON: Mrs. Retafian?
Yes?

505
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:19,659
I'm Detective Benson,
this is my partner,
Detective Stabler.

506
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:22,259
Would you mind
if we come in?
Sure.

507
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:26,866
We just wanted
to ask you about Darius.

508
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:31,204
Is he in trouble again?
Just wanna see
how he's doing.

509
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,247
He's all right, I guess.

510
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:35,612
Is this Darius?
Uh-huh.

511
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:40,747
My kid just started serving
as an altar boy.
It's a proud moment.

512
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:44,690
Can you tell us
why you pulled your son
out of the church youth club?

513
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,125
He just wasn't
fitting in there.

514
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:51,464
Did he have any contact
with Father Michael?

515
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:53,124
The priest?

516
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:56,295
Did he talk about him much,
anything Iike that?

517
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:00,734
Yes.

518
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,202
(CHOIR SINGING)

519
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,346
Very good.

520
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,481
STABLER: Father Michael!
Yes?

521
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:16,388
We need you to come
with us, please.
Why?

522
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,521
Don't make us do this
in front of them.

523
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,528
Thank you all.
I'II see you next Thursday.

524
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,659
WOMAN: Goodbye,
Father Michael.
MAN: Good night, Father.

525
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,968
Am I under arrest?
For sexual abuse.

526
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,634
You have the right
to remain silent.

527
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:40,510
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of Iaw.

528
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:41,775
You have the right
to an attorney.

529
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,578
COURT OFFICER:
"Docket number 28385.
People v, Michael Sweeney,

530
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:48,213
"Sex abuse two,
sex abuse three,

AIexandra Cabot
for the People.

532
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:52,082
Rory O'Halloran
for Father Sweeney.

533
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,652
JUDGE SELIGMAN:
How do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honor.

534
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,095
Ms. Cabot,
are you asking for bail?

535
00:29:57,165 --> 00:29:59,929
The People request that bail
be set at $200,000.

536
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:03,129
Your Honor, that's punitive.
Father Michael has taken
a vow of poverty.

537
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:04,501
He has no assets.

538
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:07,336
The Church has
more than enough money
to meet his bail, Your Honor.

539
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:09,569
JUDGE SELIGMAN: The Defendant
has no priors, Ms. Cabot.

540
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:12,442
Why are you demanding
such a substantial bail?

541
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:13,775
In the Vatican's own words,

542
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:18,285
"The defendant is guilty
of the serial, predatory
sexual abuse of minors"'

543
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:19,944
He escaped detection
in the past

544
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:24,458
with the complicity
of the Church and he is
believed to be a flight risk.

545
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,617
Then bail is set at $200,000.

546
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:30,025
Call the next case.

547
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,766
Ms. Cabot?

548
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,830
Coming to offer a deal?
Not this time.

549
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:39,168
You want a trial,
you can have one.
My pleasure.

550
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,071
Time to stop Father Michael
from molesting children.

551
00:30:41,142 --> 00:30:42,268
Father Michael is innocent.

552
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:45,779
Then why did the Church
settle with his victims
in '96?

553
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:48,315
Why did he seek therapy
to control
his sexual proclivities?

554
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:51,510
There are explanations
for that.
I Iook forward
to hearing them.

555
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:54,612
Then you'd better
prep your witnesses
for an ugly cross

556
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:58,147
because I'm going to make
their Iives very unpleasant,

557
00:30:58,226 --> 00:30:59,659
however young they are.

558
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:02,195
That should go over
really well with the jury.

559
00:31:02,263 --> 00:31:04,561
Whatever it takes
to clear him.

560
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:10,567
CABOT: Okay, Darius,
Iet's go through this
one more time.

561
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,574
When did you most often have
contact with Father Michael
at the club?

562
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:17,805
After basketball,
he'd come by the showers.

563
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:20,143
He'd hang around, talk.

564
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:22,242
Did he touch you?

565
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,511
He'd put his arm
around my shoulder,

566
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:27,148
pat me on the back.

567
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,385
Did he ever do
anything else?

568
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:37,025
At his place.

569
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,833
It's okay, baby.
You just tell her.

570
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:47,133
He'd ask me to watch videos
with him.
What kind of videos?

571
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:48,902
Sports, movies,

572
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:53,637
then other stuff.

573
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,308
Porn.

574
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,413
Then what would he do?

575
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:05,091
He'd sit

576
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:08,627
real close.

577
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:13,160
He'd tell me it was okay
to feel what I was feeling.

578
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:16,759
That it was normal.

579
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:18,460
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

580
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:20,362
AIex.

581
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,313
What are you doing here?
Trying to save your face,
Counselor.

582
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:34,548
Can I talk to your witness?
So you can intimidate him?
No.

583
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:36,453
Then Iook at this.

584
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:41,622
Recognize anything?

585
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:44,221
But this has no bearing
on what Darius is saying now.

586
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,287
Really?

587
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,529
Then Iet me suggest
a Iittle experiment.

588
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:51,833
Ask the witness about
Father Michael's television.

589
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:56,174
CABOT: Did you watch
these videos
on Father Michael's TV?

590
00:32:57,178 --> 00:32:58,167
Yeah.

591
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:01,041
Was there anything funny
about them?

592
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,045
What does she mean?

593
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:08,919
When you watched the videos,
did you notice anything
unusual about them?

594
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,458
You're asking a child
to judge pornography?

595
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:14,221
Was it Iike watching
normal TV, Darius?

596
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,124
Yeah.

597
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,094
Was it in color?

598
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:23,964
What else is there?

599
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:27,300
BIack and white.

600
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,102
Father Michael
is a few decades
behind the times.

601
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,238
What is this?

602
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:37,512
Darius was abused
at his school,
nowhere near Father Michael.

603
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:40,554
And you settled
with the Church for $50,000.

604
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:43,454
Father Michael molested him.
No, he didn't.

605
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:45,357
You recycled those accusations

606
00:33:45,426 --> 00:33:48,554
when you and your son
were questioned
by the detectives.

607
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,990
And you think your priest
isn't guilty, too?

608
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:55,124
Darius will never forget
what was done to him.

609
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,033
No money will make up
for that.

610
00:33:57,104 --> 00:34:01,040
And you would make him
re-Iive his trauma
to get every penny you can.

611
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,800
(DOOR CLOSING)

612
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:08,644
The details of Darius' abuse
were true.
He was alone with a priest,

613
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:11,583
and he watched porn videos,
and he was molested.

614
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:15,748
Mom sued, a priest
was defrocked, the diocese
settled. Mom wants more.

615
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:18,223
If someone abused my son,
I'd do more than sue them.

616
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:20,317
I doubt
you'd make false accusations.

617
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,522
So where does that
Ieave us now?
Father Michael's
going to walk.

618
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:26,657
Bobby Douglas
is all we've got.
Not anymore.

619
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:36,404
(JAIL DOOR BUZZING)

620
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,672
Bobby Douglas was placed
in a cell with a Iifer.

621
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,944
His name is Dale Farrelly.

622
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:21,215
Bobby kept trying to tell Dale
how much Jesus Ioved him,

623
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:25,088
till Dale stopped him
by stabbing him 57 times
with a homemade shiv.

624
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:29,596
This is the interesting part
though, Father. Bobby had
no defensive wounds on him.

625
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:31,392
He had no cuts on his arms
and his hands.

626
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:35,026
He never even tried
to put up his arms
to protect himself.

627
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:37,730
That boy'd given up.
Now maybe you think
he deserved it

628
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:39,796
because he killed that kid
and he burned your church.

629
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:42,707
No. No. Bobby was a victim.
Yeah. Whose victim?

630
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,811
Come on, Father,
you and me, no badge...
What do you want me
to tell you?

631
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:50,874
...no collar. Come on.
Bobby's dead!
You're free as a bird.

632
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:54,887
Be a man, confess to me!
AII right! AII right!
It was me. I abused him.

633
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:57,719
How?
I took him to my room,

634
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:00,819
gave him some beer
and made him have sex with me.

635
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:02,556
What about the videos?
Yes.

636
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,724
We watched videos
to get us in the mood.

637
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:08,257
Where?

638
00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:12,533
I told you, in my room.
When did you go to the Lair?

639
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:17,671
Tell me what you told
the boys,

640
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:20,179
how they'd go in Iike Iambs,
come out Iike Iions.

641
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:26,480
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

642
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:32,189
Somebody must do penance
for Bobby.
Oh, yeah.
But it ain't you, is it?

643
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,052
And those therapy sessions,
is that all fiction, too?

644
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,722
That was real.
You give me the names

645
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:39,925
of the boys you abused.
There are no names.

646
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,130
I've controlled my desires.
I have kept every one
of my vows,

647
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:47,800
poverty, chastity, obedience.
Well, then why'd Bobby
accuse you?

648
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:53,374
Because he came to me
for help,
and I didn't protect him.

649
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:58,209
Why'd you Ieave school?
Shame.
For what I failed to do.

650
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:02,153
Failed to protect him
against another priest, yeah?
Right?

651
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:04,248
Yes.
I want a name.

652
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:08,283
I can't. He confessed.

653
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:14,697
You priests,
you got it all figured out,
don't you?

654
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:15,928
You confess to each other.

655
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:17,971
You forgive each other,
and you go right on sinning.

656
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:19,835
I'm sorry.
Go to hell.

657
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:28,581
He's covering
for another priest, just Iike
he covered for Bobby Douglas.

658
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:31,615
No court is going to force him
to break the seal
of confession.

659
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:34,085
Then we Iook
at the '96 case again.

660
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:36,145
This priest must have been
at Saint Tom's

661
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:38,248
when Bobby and the other boys
were abused.

662
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:41,089
Check the staff roster.
Check if any other payments
were made.

663
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:44,961
I want you to subpoena
any records and bank accounts
that we have to.

664
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:48,399
Easy to say,
but on what grounds?
BENSON: What about RICO?

665
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:51,802
D.A"s tried it in CIeveland,
in Texas, even in Jersey.

666
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:53,305
And two out of three failed.

667
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:56,434
Well, I'II take those odds,
AIex. What else do we have?

668
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,175
JUDGE LINDEN:
Racketeering, Ms. Cabot?

669
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:05,776
New Jersey already
dismissed a RICO case
against the Church.

670
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:09,380
But the violations
have continued, and innocent
people are still being harmed.

671
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:11,617
Mr. O'Halloran?
The Church has been
more than willing

672
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:15,560
to turn over documents
for cases of abuse by priests
without the necessity

673
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:18,097
of a subpoena.
When it suits them.

674
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:21,157
Only yesterday, Mr. O'Halloran
showed me a secret settlement

675
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:23,863
the Diocese made
with the family
of a 14-year-old boy.

676
00:38:23,937 --> 00:38:25,370
Now how many more
of these are there?

677
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:28,772
We'II turn over files relating
to all allegations of abuse,

678
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:32,835
but the request for the
Diocese's discretionary
accounts overreaches.

679
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:34,403
We have some rights
to privacy.

680
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:37,211
The accounts will show
how the Church has
consistently made payouts

681
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:40,685
to individuals to buy
their silence and evade
criminal investigation.

682
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:43,780
That is a definition
of a corrupt organization
under RICO.

683
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:47,725
I'm inclined to agree.
You have your subpoena,
Ms. Cabot.

684
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:50,490
The Diocese will surrender
all reports of abuse,

685
00:38:50,564 --> 00:38:54,967
all records of priest
transfers, and will give
the New York District Attorney

686
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:58,163
access to the Diocese's
discretionary accounts.

687
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,570
AII right. We got payments
to the Ramsay family,

688
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:03,872
to the Campions,
to the Zuniga family.

689
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:07,812
Checks drawn in October '96,
$150,000 each.

690
00:39:07,881 --> 00:39:11,612
What about Bobby Douglas?
We've got Mary Douglas,
$100,000.

691
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:15,211
Bobby even Iost out
in the abuse stakes.
Who signed the checks?

692
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:17,018
Looks Iike Randall.

693
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,891
John Randall,
Bishop before Mallinson.

694
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:24,424
The cover-up went straight
to the top.
And stayed there.

695
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:27,729
Every quarter Mary Douglas
gets $10,000 from the Diocese.

696
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:31,464
Each check is signed
by Bishop Mallinson
right up until Iast month.

697
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:34,166
Why would Mallinson
continue making the payments?

698
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:38,735
Maybe because he started them.
Staff roster
for Saint Thomas', 1996.

699
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:42,211
Guess who was
a visiting Latin teacher
three times a week?

700
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:45,342
Father Mallinson.
And Bobby was his star pupil.

701
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:50,522
STABLER: I know
who you're protecting.

702
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:57,593
I need to know
what he told you.

703
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:00,322
I can't.

704
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:09,073
Why'd you
become a priest, Father?

705
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:14,211
To serve God and his Church.

706
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:18,479
That includes those boys
that were abused.

707
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:22,116
How are you serving them?

708
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:27,925
To the best of my ability
without breaking
the Sacraments.

709
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:30,086
By protecting the sinner.

710
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:33,959
By protecting a priest
who confessed that,

711
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:36,229
"I am abusing a child"'

712
00:40:38,405 --> 00:40:40,873
He promised me
that he would get treatment.

713
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:45,674
Then he came back to you
and confessed the same sin
all over again, didn't he?

714
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:50,678
And you absolved him again.

715
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:55,884
What, because you are bound
by your Sacrament?

716
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:57,116
Yes.

717
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:02,425
Silence is a sin, Father.
I cannot break the seal.

718
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:05,795
Not to defend my name,
not to save my own Iife,

719
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:09,859
not to save
someone else's Iife. I have
to protect the penitent.

720
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:14,937
But what
of the faithful, Father?

721
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,770
Who protects us?

722
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:35,490
What about my vows?

723
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:39,893
What about the children?

724
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:50,902
STABLER: Your Grace.

725
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:55,415
Detective Stabler. Michael.
How can I help you?

726
00:41:58,085 --> 00:42:00,815
I need to ask you
about statements you made
to Father Michael

727
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:03,857
in July and September of 1996.

728
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,490
What statements?

729
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:12,799
Relating to sexual acts that
you forced on various boys
at Saint Thomas's school.

730
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:15,926
No.

731
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,669
See, what's shared
in the confession between
a priest and a penitent

732
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,607
is sacred and confidential.

733
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:30,544
Michael, do you know
what you've done?

734
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:38,884
You'II be expelled
from the priesthood and you'II
be cast out of the Church,

735
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:41,623
barred from the Sacraments.

736
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,523
You're risking your soul.

737
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,164
I... I believe I'm saving it.

738
00:42:57,477 --> 00:42:59,468
How could you do this?

739
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:08,887
I couldn't help myself.
